He doesn’t respond during the work day and it’s been hard to carry a conversation after work or even on the weekend. On Friday we finally set a time to meet and he asks if I’m okay with a coffee walk date. As most women and I’m sure men know by now as well this is the worst type of date. So I’m already annoyed but I agree anyway. 
We were supposed to meet today at 7pm and he just messaged that he has to cancel and if I’d be down for during the week or next weekend. 
I’m turned off from meeting at all now because it’s Sunday and if you’re too busy to meet for atleast 90 mins then how do you plan to date someone to even grab a coffee. Should I suck it up and reschedule or unmatch?

I'm sure there are some people here who are familiar with the pain of having had their childhood collection sold/thrown out by a family member or maybe some of their cards stolen at school. Both happened to me too and it genuinely hurts to think about...  - \_ -

But recently I've had the urge to do what child me couldn't do and collect the original 151 across Base Set/Fossil/Jungle and put them in a nice coffee table binder. 

The only problem is knowing the best (and hopefully not bank breaking) way to complete this. I guess I am looking for some advice on where the best places are to start:

* Which websites/sellers generally price individual cards the best?
* Where might be good places to pick up bulk vintage and maybe check off a few at once?
* I live in London, so any recommendations from some locals on some places to try would be amazing.
* Condition doesn't have to be pristine, but just not have a ton of visible damage.
* Unfortunately I don't have a lot of cards to trade, besides a reasonable amount of vintage Yu-Gi-Oh..

Obviously I imagine Ebay is probably the go-to. But I very quickly got tired of looking over the tons of lots listed for criminal prices.. Plus, I am trying to stay away from bulk I really don't need.

Thanks in advance for any advice or strategies people are willing to throw my way!

the main issue is that that i'm petite compared to other girls in modeling + need to do whatever i can to appear taller on camera.

that means... weight loss. 

i need to lose 10-20 lbs as quickly as possible while maintaining my health. 
my day job is very physical + would be dangerous as hell if i were to completely starve myself. 

other major problem: i already eat well. i'm vegan, i don't drink alcohol, i never eat fast food. so all the easy dietary cuts won't work for me-

these are my current bad habits... i don't want to give all of them up, but some harsh truth would help. please don't be scared to hurt my feelings-

1. i love coffee. i usually get an iced americano with a splash of oat milk, sometimes i get an unsweet almond milk latte. 

2. i eat a lot of fruit, all types + probably too much- 

3. i sometimes have almonds/ walnuts as a snack. they're high in calories...

4. i really like cereal- i only eat protein cereals, like catalina crunch or three wishes... but they're probably not the best.

5. sometimes i share treats with my boyfriend- like bites of a vegan muffin or cookie here + there. i'm probably underestimating how many calories are in the little bites. i know they add up.

6. i don't work out as often as i probably should- my main job is outside + slightly physical, so i feel tired most of the time. 

any advice would be great- please don't be afraid to be mean or blunt, i definitely need the tough love. thank you so much <3

1fxh35o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/1fxh35o/bitcoin_is_horrible/,Bitcoin is horrible!,"**Why Bitcoin sucks**

Bitcoin's annual electricity consumption is in the range of 100 to 150 terawatt-hours (TWh).

To put this into perspective, this level of consumption is comparable to that of medium-sized countries. For example:

   * Argentina: Approximately 200 TWh annually.
   * Netherlands: Around 120 TWh annually.
   * Malaysia: Close to 300 TWh annually.

One day you're rich, the next you're crying into your Satoshi. If you enjoy financial heart palpitations, Bitcoin's volatility is just the adrenaline rush you need.

With a max of \~7 transactions per second, Bitcoin can't even handle a fraction of today's payment systems. Forget about buying a coffee; your transaction might still be pending when you take another sip.

Beyond energy consumption, Bitcoin's e-waste problem is real. Obsolete mining rigs are piling up, creating electronic mountains in landfills. Who needs new gadgets when you can recycle the old ones into cryptographic algorithms?

Bitcoin is a playground for scammers and shady deals.

Bitcoin is primarily used for speculation rather than real-world applications. It's the digital equivalent of buying gold bricks and hoping someone will want to trade them for something useful.

Bitcoin is not as decentralized as you'd think. A handful of mining pools control the majority of the network, putting power back into the hands of a few rather than the many.

1fxgvmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Landlord/comments/1fxgvmo/landlordowner_potential_va_considering_renting/,[Landlord/owner (potential) - VA] Considering renting out spare room to short term tenants as first time landlord; any wisdom appreciated,"My fiancee and I are considering turning our spare-bedroom-turned-home-office in Northern VA/DC area back into a spare bedroom for rent to help cover the mortgage/save for our wedding. In an ideal world, our tenant would be a short term month-to-month traveling professional (nurse, on-project consultant, etc.) or perhaps a grad student.

**My first question is if furnished is good or bad?**

The bedroom is sizable, and is currently furnished with a full bed + sheets, desk, small couch, coffee table, a bunch of our art, and TV and stand. The shades are those roman wooden slats. The furniture is not in a state of disrepair or anything, but it's not exactly new and fancy... think Ikea/Amazon after 3, 4 years of use. We don't really want to try and find new space for these items by moving them all out. 

* Is this going to help or hurt our tenant prospects? Do traveling professionals expect furnished environments to be pristine? 
* How does furnished vs. unfurnished impact the price? 
* Do people bring their own sheets, etc. in these situations?

**What are the pitfalls to renting out a room in the place you live as well?** 

* Self explanatory 

**When doing short-term or month-to-month, are you renting out at market rate? Above? Below?** 

* We aren't sure what the tradeoffs might be for each party when doing month to month. Are these renters expected to pay more because of the shorter notice (plus as we understand it, decent salaries)? 

**How transparent are we expected to be about the financial breakdown?** 

* We aren't trying to make a living off this arrangement, simply cover HOA/Mortgage. That said, we're worried that it's a subject that could cause tension. Any suggestions or anecdotes to share? 

Any help would be great! Thx

After some load testing this morning that gave me some mediocre/poor results I got to thinking about “wonder powders” that you’ve tried that just don’t seem to impress.  Over the last two years of reloading Iv encountered loads or powders that everyone seem to love, but just don’t cut if for ME, and was curious what everyone else’s experiences were. 

For me, it has to be XBR 8208. 

Iv mostly tried it in 6.5 Grendel because it is always top of the list in recommendations.  But so far across 5 different projectiles it has just been very mediocre to downright poor in accuracy.  

In 308 it is OKAY on speed, but accuracy just seems to fall short compared to many other powders.  

The silver lining to me, is it’s a unicorn powder that has been nearly impossible to find, and often times I’m getting better results from a cheaper powder anyways, so maybe it’s best that I’m not falling in love with it.  ",1,1728222197.0,reloading,6,0.67,False

The next chapter of my coffee shop AU is posted! Aziraphale finally hears what Crowley has to say - and it’s complicated. 

Preview:

Entering the front door of Haberdashery, he found he could breathe a little easier. This was a familiar place with familiar rhythms; here, he knew what to expect from everyone and what everyone expected of him. He smiled at Newt as he waved then went to the back to put on his yellow apron. Apron donned, he took his post behind the counter to start his day.

For an hour and a half, everything went exactly as it should have. Regular customers and tourists came and went and coffee was served. For the first time, he noticed that Newt and Anathema were especially flirtatious. Aziraphale seemed to have developed a sixth sense for such romantic undercurrents overnight. Their shy back-and-forth occupied much of his attention that morning. It was fascinating, a guilty pleasure, like watching an old rom-com movie happening right in front of him. He found his own thoughts drifting.

“Mmhmm,” someone behind him cleared their throat. Aziraphale whipped around to face the register and whoever had startled him. 

“Crowley!” Aziraphale couldn’t help the unguarded enthusiasm in his face nor the bright red flush in his cheeks.

1fxgnmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1fxgnmq/on_feeling_guilty_with_spending_my_money/,on feeling guilty with spending my money ,"I feel like I shouldn't really share this, but I've got too much feelings tonight and I just have to write it down. The past few months, I've been spending a lot. Spending like I haven't before. Not in a way that I've been buying expensive things, but more so trying to allow myself to indulge. Two weeks ago I finally ordered take out indian food — for the first time. I usually just browse on Grab and add it to cart but I never push through because my parents dont like it, so I'd rather buy food we would all eat. But since I live alone now, I'm kinda forced to think of myself first and take care of myself first. That night I finally pressed ""place order"" and I may have squealed and jumped once I got the food. Lol. This morning, I ordered a pumpkin spiced latte from starbucks, for the first time too. I paid P270 for that. Gosh, that's a lot for a drink and I shouldn't have ordered from SB tbh (lmk if other local coffee shops sell pumpkin spice lattes!), but for today, I wanted to indulge and treat myself because i've been missing autumn and I just wanted to romanticize my rest day haha. I probably wont do it again, but for today I felt happy for me. 

As an eldest daughter, I rarely indulge (except with my favorite things in the world: books, stationery, perfumes and japan surplus dishware hehe). I don't blame my parents or my life situation, that's just how it has always been, and according to reddit, this is probably trauma and honestly, that's okay with me. I know I've got a lifetime ahead of me to heal that and process that. 

Last month I told my mom that I haven't saved as much as I want, I told her ""I feel okay though. Everything's paid for, and I try to buy what I want, eat what I want. I try to say yes to things I wouldn't say yes to."" And she assured me saying, ""That's good. That's okay. You're working to live, not living to work. Just be happy and enjoy your life. We're okay."" I'm very lucky that my parents have never forced me to take care of them financially. I guess, its just me wanting to make sure that everyone is okay. I've always said, if they're okay, I'm okay.

At 28, I feel like I'm still growing up. (Do we ever stop growing up?) I'm slowly learning that your life situation will change, and that you must also allow it to change. I'm slowly learning to be kinder to myself, even though this feels foreign, even though its honestly giving me anxiety to spend. Lol. I'm trying to find the balance between saving and allowing myself to spend, just because I worked hard for it and that it's simply okay to order that coffee, or buy that sticker. I'm also learning that I am my own person, outside of being a daughter, a sister or a friend...I am my own person. (honestly, what a responsibility to myself! hahahuhu)

Anyways, as Mary Oliver has said, ""If you suddenly and unexpected feel joy, don't hesitate. Give in to it. Whatever it is, don't be afraid of its plenty. Joy is not made to be a crumb."" 

(Thank you for allowing me to write my feelings down. Gonna go cry it out now and think of how my parents are getting older too. Ugh. I hate it here. 😩)

1fxgjtu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1fxgjtu/my_inlaws_want_to_move_in_for_three_months_after/,My In-laws want to move in for three months after our child is born.,"Apologies for the long rant. TLDR at the bottom. I (36f, white) and my husband (36m, ABC) have been together for 6 years and we're expecting our first child in February. We live over 600 miles away from his parents. My husband is their only son and this will be their first grandchild. We've had to move several times, and will be moving again before the birth. When we first started dating and for the first few years of our relationship, we were a three hour drive away from his parents and would travel there or they'd come stay with us for extended weekends. That was always fun. We'd cook together, I'd make a mix of American and Chinese food, they'd teach me how to fold dumplings, it was always a good time when the visits were short and I had adequate time to make our home hospitable for them.

We've had to make a couple cross country moves, and when the distance grew longer, so did their visits. We only see them a few times a year but they end up staying for two whole weeks each time. These visits have often coincided with bad timing. I'm a consultant and sometimes there's nothing to do, and other times I'm so batshit busy it will be 3pm and I'll realize I've only had coffee all day. I've also had some health things come up right before their visits. I've felt bad because I've been increasingly been unable to be adequately prepared to be a good host when they come. Once they arrived before I came home from a work trip and couldn't decompress or have quick food options available or clean the house.

My in-laws are really kind people, they're extremely wholesome and kind, and they really mean well. They do. But they are viciously type A people who need to be constantly doing something and my husband and I both victims of untreated ADHD and do things at a much slower pace. Because of this, my in-laws end up steamrolling everything.

They've helped with every single move we've done and I find it infuriating because they unpack everything and put things that make no sense to me. Every time I spend the next few months trying to find my own stuff in my own house. We're preparing to move again and I'm already mentally preparing myself for the frustration of that because although my husband does step in and put his foot down, they will still do it to their liking anyway.

We had trouble conceiving and all my PTO has been spent on IVF the past couple of years, so when they come to visit, I can't take time off. They will start preparing to cook weeknight dinner at 4pm. I get off at 5. There's no way I can compete with that and get into the kitchen and be a good host. They survived the great leap forward and have a lot of behaviors from dealing with food insecurity that result in extremely odd choices during homecooked meals. I say this not to be culturally insensitive, I say this as someone who spent a year studying abroad in the same city they're from and having a homestay with a Chinese family and as someone who enjoys cooking and learning how to cook Chinese food herself. I don't dare complain, but sometimes I find their meal choices unpalatable, will get shamed for being picky and receive a lecture about what it was like growing up in China during the revolution.

Don't get me wrong. I appreciate the things they went through, but that doesn't mean the leftover hard boiled eggs from this morning should be chopped up with onions and thrown on top of my very expensive salmon that was in the freezer this morning which has been cooked to oblivion and is dry and reminds me of jerky at this point. I had plans for that salmon, and that salmon was expensive. Why didn't they just use black bean sauce? I have everything needed to just do the fermented black bean thing. I have a very well stocked pantry with both both Asian and Chinese options. I keep a solid stock of black fungus, mushrooms, beans, all the major sauces in Chinese cooking..  the whole nine yards. We could have eaten the eggs on the side and onions last forever! Lemon and asparagus was literally in the fridge. Hell, even just throwing garlic on it. On top of that, everyone amongst us makes 6 figures. They came here with nothing and did well for themselves. They retired and have more than they can spend. I understand never forgetting your roots. I have some bizarre origin tales of my own. I don't dare complain about their cooking, but this day in and day out for two weeks and I start losing my mind. I've tried several things to make meal time more habitable but it always ends up back at this.

We also have different philosophies of ""healthy."" They think of healthy as eating as many foods wechat said had some sort of healthy properties as possible. For instance, black fungus a supposedly reduces cholesterol. It's present at every meal they cook in abundance. They are very anti-salt. I don't mind these things. When I cook for them I don't salt my food so they can have it to their preference and I'll always cook a side dish with black fungus because I do also enjoy it myself. My husband and I follow a more western philosophy of having balanced macros and eating a wide variety of different vegetables, proteins, and grains. We aren't religious about it, but we also like to eat less processed food. There is nothing wrong with either of these philosophies, but it irks me when they accuse us of not eating healthy because we're not jamming the latest wechat food trend into every meal. Neither of us is fat. My husband looks like a freaking personal trainer. It's a stretch calling us unhealthy.

Now that I'm pregnant, I've had a tough time with food. I have had difficulty keeping most things down even past my first trimester. Sometimes I'll end up eating oatmeal for dinner because that's the only thing I can stomach. Most mornings I reach for a meal replacement shake because I know I'll be able to keep that down. They came and stayed over and my FIL was goading me every morning about how I wouldn't survive being pregnant in China during the revolution because I vomit at the smell of eggs right now and say things like ""China didn't have protein shakes during the revolution, you would have died."" Okay, but we don't live in China during the revolution and if we were then I'm pretty sure I'd be having the same problems and be sacrificing my own personal health to malnutrition because this unborn baby is biologically programmed to take from me what it needs whether I have enough to support me and an unborn child or not. But it's 2024 in the US and I know what I can reliably eat right now and fed is best. I can afford a protein shake and I am going to leverage that because I know it will provide me more nourishment than eggs which I will promptly lose my stomach to.

Once when they visited, I had a miscarriage. That wasn't fun. I just wanted to be alone but they were there the entire time. Now that we're halfway through this pregnancy and things are going very well, they've told me they're planning on moving in with us during the first three months after the baby is born. I don't know who I'm going to be as a new mom, but by the end of the two week stays my brain quits allowing me to override my avoidant tendencies and I start sinking into a depression over the meal drama. I don't want to deal with this for three whole months, especially when I will have spent nine months unable to stomach meat and will be wanting to eat what I want to eat whenever I want to eat it. I plan on meal prepping ahead of the birth to make my ability to do so without much effort. I will be wearing depends and scraggly. I will want to bond with this baby alone. I don't do well with unsolicited advice and I know I'll be getting a plethora of it if they stay. I'd rather be in a mindset to be a fun and pleasant daughter in law and I can't sustain that for two whole weeks let alone 3 months. I know myself.

I told my husband hell no in private. We're moving closer to them and will only be a couple hours' drive away, at most they can come during the weekends. My husband has had a couple months to set this expectation and hasn't. I asked yesterday if he's said anything and he responded with ""what an I supposed to say when they're really disappointed?"" And I honestly don't care what he's supposed to say. We both are worn out by the end of their two week stays and I would be starting below my baseline after giving birth.

Does anyone have advice for navigating this and ensuring they don't come stay for this long? I don't want to damage the relationship because while I've spent this entire post dragging them, they truly are great in-laws. I love my MIL. Hell, we got tipsy and went dancing on a cruise together. I don't think that's something most people can say they did with their Chinese MIL. We have a lot of fun and jokes and they're otherwise just really awesome people. We have fantastic vacations. We love nature and binge hiking, and on those long hikes my FIL and I always end up having crazy deep philosophical discussions about the paradox of his feelings about the cultural revolution, life, and politics, stuff I don't think I'd ever talk about with my own parents. My MIL has helped me through some really tough times and hasn't ever passed judgement on me.

It's amusing because I was just making matcha tea.

For context: I have 3 older siblings. Sister A and B are over 40, both married and lives in the USA. Sister C (39F) and her husband lives with me and our mother (63F). This is normal within our culture.

Sister A sent me real matcha powder from her trip in Japan a while back. So, I went and bought an actual bamboo whisk that Japanese people often use to mix matcha. I'm a real sucker for tea, so that's why I often buy or ask for authentic stuff.

For those who don't know, pure matcha is in a deep, green color and can taste very earthy. A friend of mine said it tastes like grass and said it looks like cannabis. But I love it. Also, in my country, matcha一and tea, in general一aren't popular choices for drinks, and my BIL is a black coffee guy, hence his lack of knowledge about tea. Furthermore, whenever I order boba tea, it's usually earl grey with cream cheese foam. I believe, if my memory serves me right, he's never seen me drink matcha boba tea before.

So, one time, it was late at night and I wanted matcha. I was stirring it with my bamboo whisk in our dim kitchen when my BIL came by to retrieve his water tumbler from the freezer (it was summer). He saw me and was already suspicious about what I was concocting in the kitchen. I jokingly told him that it was cannabis. He believed me and was just in shock. He calmly warned me about the effects of cannabis and that it's illegal, but, to further the bluff, I just reassured him that I won't get addicted. He also told me that if our mother finds out, she'd go ballistic, but I assured him she won't find out. He just scratched his head and walked out and didn't mention it again until the next time it happened. Honestly, it was usually a coincidence that I'd make my matcha during late nights when our mother is already asleep or in the afternoons when she wasn't home. He also assumed that my sister knows but just dismissed it, saying that I'm ""an adult with responsibilities and can face the consequences of my actions"" (she was actually in on the joke since she knew it was just matcha powder). Sometimes, I'd even invite him to have a sip but he always refuses, escaping the kitchen immediately to do something else. I knew he wouldn't sell me out to our mother since he's not that type of person. He thinks I'm still in my rebellious phase一experimenting, exploring unorthodox stuff, etc一and believes I'll snap out of it when I get a bit more older, because he ""once had that phase,"" he said.

For months, I let him believe he still thinks I consume cannabis and I don't have the heart to tell him it's just matcha because his reaction whenever he sees me mixing the matcha is too funny.",6,1728221308.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,0.8,False
1fxghen,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1fxghen/i_need_serious_help_with_this_one_girl_i_might_go/,"I need SERIOUS help with this one girl, I might go crazy...","Recently I've been thinking A LOT about this one girl that I never even dated and was wondering if anyone could give me advice if I should contact her or not. It's a pretty long story so you might want to get some popcorn.

Everything started at the end of march 2023, I went to the mall with a friend and saw this one girl working in the sneaker store keep looking at me, she was looking good but for some reason I felt something different about her and needed to ask for her IG(also I literally NEVER approach when I'm outside, except at clubs when not sober, so the fact I didn't even hesitate was insane). She ended up giving me her number because she didn't have IG and honestly she looked interested too.

  
We ended up texting that same night and out of every place in my city(and its pretty big city) she lives in my old neighborhood and used to go to high school that is in my new neighborhood and the whole conversation she kept giving me props for coming up to her. After that I was trying to link with her in person so I could get to know her better(and because I don't like to text) but she told me she was feeling sick and we went on a date after 10-15 days and the WHOLE time in messages she kept saying she is sorry because it looks like she is delaying but she told me that she wouldn't give me her number if she didn't want to/was interested.

Then in the beginning of April I went to meet her for the 1st time at a coffee shop, we were talking for like 2-3 hours non stop about anything and everything like we known each other our whole lives, and we had same interests in music, sports etc. and she was also introverted. After coffee I walked her to the mall she worked at(it was very close) and she told me she was looking forward to seeing me again.

Now it starts to get bad... I messaged her few days after our date and she was replying very slow and kept telling me she is not feeling good and needed some time for herself, and the whole time I kept asking her what was the problem because I genuinely felt bad and wanted to help her if I could. That's been going on for a few days and then I saw she blocked me when I messaged her one time, and I sent her a text from 2nd phone and told her something like ""you could've just told me if you was not interested""(not the exact msg I can't remember it honestly). She unblocked me after that and texted my 1st phone ""sorry, it's not your fault it's me(more text after this)"" and I was like oh yeah it's my fault for sure LOL, but at the end of her long paragraph she said ""you wouldn't believe what things came in my life"" and in my language that means something very bad happened so I was like okay all the best and stopped talking to her.

This whole no contact time every now and then I would think about her like I couldn't control it. Few months later, around beginning of July, I sent her a msg and asked her how she been and if she is interested to link up. She ended up responding 5 DAYS LATER. I didn't even expect her to reply, and she told me that she still thinks I'm a amazing guy, but she is still not okay and needs to figure out what she wants in life and after that I told her to tell me honestly is it my fault or she got another dude or something in which she said it's not my fault and she isn't looking for ANYONE, not only me and that maybe its best if we separate FOR NOW. So I was like you still want to keep in contact in which she said yes. After few weeks I msg her again to see what she been up to but she didn't respond in 6 hours and I flipped and swore telling her ""idgaf to keep messaging when she acting like this"" and she told me that she understands where I'm coming from and STILL thinks I'm this awesome guy. Then she told me that the other time when she texted me 5 days later, I messaged her when she was on her dads grave that passed away in time I was talking with her and she had another death happen and that she doesn't open up and talk a lot, even with her friends. She also told me she is going to therapist hoping that would help and that she also doesn't want to ""pull"" me into her darkness, and that I don't deserve that. I felt really bad and wished her all the best.

Here I come AGAIN at the end of September and tried to message her on a more positive/jokingly way about something that happened in basketball, because I remember she told me she was interested in that, and at the time I was still playing it actively. She answered in like 5 mins and we were talking a bit about life, she told me she been on 3 vacations(which my friends told me is weird if she been going through all of the things she told me before)with her friend, mom and sister. I messaged her again few days later because she was supposed to come back to country and she never replied back.

Listened to my stupid friend to msg her around new years and tell her I wish her all the best in upcoming year, of course no reply.

I called her phone in February and it was ringing but no answer.

Here is the end of the story, after you read all this I want to know your honest opinion if I should message this girl again and what should I say. I really been with girls since I was 12-13(21 now) and I can tell if someone is interested or not and I never had a problem to leave the person if they don't want nothing, but in this situation I really don't know what to do, it's been a year and a half since I met her and my head is still going nuts. I met girls this 1st year of college that are going crazy for me(not trying to brag) but I honestly didn't hook up with none of them because I'm not focused on that at this point of my life, I really want one good girl but it seems like the first and last time I felt about liking someone seriously was with this girl from year and a half ago. Also if you think I shouldn't text her, what should I do because I really been feeling sick thinking this much about somebody like never before and I'm tired of it especially because I got crazy stuff myself that I've been going through with my mom since I don't have contact with my father and am not really close with my sister.

”well”, says the guy who wants to rip his head off, “I’m stupid and have no idea how to read social cues, and I often have a tendency to overthink literally everything I do.”

so yeah, this girl and I often look at each other whenever we are near each her, I have not been able to hang out with her alone, only in group settings of about 5-6 people. Anyway sometimes i look at her, and sometimes she looks at me, when we make eye contact we smile and look away.  
she has also waved to me in public, it was one of those wiggle finger “flirty“ waves, and I don’t know how to interpret that… she also laughs at my jokes, given I’ve been told I’m funny, but like most of my jokes are stupid and she still laughs at them, or at least smiles.

there seems to be genuine interest on both sides, but as previously stated I'm terrible at this kind of stuff.

so I resort to the internet! The only place filled with the upmost and absolute truth, but seriously any advice?

The History of Heart of the Jedi and How it Didn't Get Published
By Kenneth C. Flint
 
In 1991, I was making my living as an author.  I was writing two books a year for Spectra, the sci-fi-fantasy imprint of Bantam Doubleday Dell.  I’d had twelve books published, with a seven book backlist and a million books in print.  I had just signed a new two book contract with Spectra, with titles to be decided later.  Then I got an exciting word from my editor.
 
Because of the success of a hardcover Star Wars trilogy by Timothy Zahn, Lucasfilm had asked Spectra to publish an additional series of paperbacks.  Spectra had searched through its stable for suitable authors, sending copies of our works to Lucasfilm for selection.  My books were Celtic-based sword-and sorcery, but my Sidhe series books were a fantasy/sci-fi combination, and a review of Riders of the Sidhe said it “has enough derring-do for at least one Lucas film.”
 
Apparently George Lucas thought so too, because I was told he had personally selected me to do a Star Wars book.  Even better, I would be writing Book One of the proposed series, taking place immediately after the second Death Star is destroyed [Note: This would have been followed by Margaret Weiss’ Legacy of Doom, with both books to be preceded by Jim Baikie’s Exiles of the Forcefour-part comic-book mini-series from Dark Horse Comics.  Weiss later stated that she'd had a disagreement with Lucasfilm, and Baikie’s series was cancelled –Ed.]  Being a crazy big Star Wars fan (I saw the first movie seven times in the theater and drank my coffee from a Star Wars mug), you can imagine how thrilled I was.
 
I was given pretty much free rein on developing my plot, other than that it should take place immediately after the second Death Star is destroyed.  I up front figured it would be most logical to deal with a defeated but not destroyed Empire, its military desperately trying to regroup and retaliate against the Alliance, while other elements sought to make peace.  Along with this was my assumption that I had to deal with what Luke Skywalker had become, and where he was going as a Jedi.
 
I spent the first months developing an outline and submitted it to my editor.  I want to make the point, here, that I never, throughout all this, communicated directly with the Lucasfilm people or knew who they were.  I worked for Spectra, and everything came through my editor.  But I was told, and veryhonored to hear, that George Lucas himself had approved my plot, with one specific alteration—I had shown Sand People without their masks, and he said that that must never happen.
 
I spent most of the next year writing that book, putting my own books aside.  My primary sources were the movies themselves, which I watched over-and-over (often in slo-mo), and a Star Wars Sourcebook for game players from West End Games that Lucasfilm supplied.  By the end of 1992 I had a draft ready.  I sent it in and waited… and waited. When I inquired as to how it was going, my editor said that the process of the Star Wars project had stalled as they developed the rest of the series.  And she still had to go through it herself before sending it to Lucasfilm for their assessment.  I believed her.  Why not?  I finally got a list of mostly minor stuff and started revisions.
 
After more months passed, I heard from my editor that “things were moving ahead again with the Star Wars project.”  I finished my revisions and submitted it.  Again, I was told the Lucas people approved it.  In fact, they said they “quite liked it.”
 
Then I waited.  Yet more months went by.  I heard nothing.  Stupidly, I had no agent through all this.  I didn’t think I needed one, as I’d always dealt directly with Spectra and been fairly treated. Finally, growing concerned, I contacted an agent who contacted Spectra.  He discovered only then that Spectra had determined my book couldn’t be published because it “no longer fit into the sequence for the new series.”
 
I was told that this happened because of my Spectra editor.  She had supposedly promised another author of the group (a friend of hers, according to one source) that her book would be placed in Position One.  This apparently accounted for the “delays” that I had been told about, while she wrote her own book to slip into my slot while I sat idle and ignorant of what was happening for months.  I have made a point of not knowing who this other author is, and I have never been able to bring myself to read her book, or any other of the subsequent series, saddened that this so violated my love of everything Star Wars.
 
Did I confront Lucasfilm and try to fight this situation?  Nope.  I didn’t know who to contact or how, remember.  I worked for Spectra.  I had no resources of my own, I was pitifully naïve, and I felt pretty much powerless by that point.
 
Oh, they graciously let me keep the ten thousand dollar advance.  And they threw me a bone letting me still do two Star Wars short stories (for Tales from Jabba’s Palace and Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina), but I was done otherwise.  None of my own books came out as the debacle went on (I would normally have published four new ones during this time).  I lost my backlist of Irish books.  Because of the long delay, my family pretty much lived on my advance for two years on expectation of the eventual payday from the Star Wars book.
 
This basically destroyed my relationship with Spectra and my career as I writer.  I felt completely betrayed, and I was so depressed that I quit writing for years.  Needing money to support my family with two young sons, I found a job as a Publications Consultant (meaning, tech writer) and, after another ten years, finally made up the financial loss of being all but unemployed for two years.
 
Finally, nearing sixty years old and with the boys both adults and employed, I decided to semi-retire and work on a book idea that had enthused me enough to try writing again… But not sci-fi or fantasy.  It was to be a Civil War adventure with a Jules Vernesque plotline that had a band of Confederate agents trying to save the South by destroying Washington DC with the world’s first Weapon of Mass Destruction.  It would be called NITRO!
 
I went back to teaching as an English department adjunct for the University of Nebraska at Omaha (my alma mater) and got the book written.  I then discovered that, nowadays, an author of fiction can’t even submit a book to a publisher without going through an agent.
 
I searched for an agent for a couple of years, but found no one.  It seems that unless they are sure they can sell a specific book of yours, they won’t handle you.  I guess that seems fair.  And I had been out of the business (by my own choice) a long time. 
 
But then I got a new chance.  An online publisher agreed to put out all my old novels as e-books.  He also published my new book, now called Ironclad.
 
I’ve written other things too, since then.  My family does living history at the reconstructed 1820’s frontier outpost called Fort Atkinson (near Omaha).  I started a series of historical novels based at the place, and got a history book of the fort published through Arcadia.
 
So my old fans can still find my books through Amazon.  But, man, I’d love to get Ironclad put out as a physical book, and I still have ideas for other fantasy, sci-fi, and horror plots, plus the twenty or so other Celtic/Irish books I’d still like to write.  I think I’ve got at least a few viable years of authorship in me.  (So, if anybody knows of somebody who’d like to represent me, I am ready to start writing two books a year again.)  Otherwise, I am quite content teaching some writing classes and being the school time daycare for my two grandsons, age 3 years and 6 months.",1,1728220405.0,novelization,0,1.0,False

So, you’re wondering, “What kind of jewelry do guys really like on women?” Well, you’ve landed in the right spot! The bling you choose can send all sorts of signals, from a hint of personality to a splash of style. But hold on—preferences aren’t one-size-fits-all! What might make one guy’s heart flutter might leave another guy scratching his head. Let's dive into this sparkling world and decode what jewelry resonates best with the male eye.

# Understanding Taste in Jewelry

Personal Preferences Vary

Just like your favorite coffee order, every guy has his unique taste, and trust me, jewelry is no different! Some guys are drawn to classic and understated pieces that whisper elegance, while others might gravitate toward bold, out-there statement pieces that scream personality.



# Cultural Influences

Culture plays a massive role in shaping our tastes, right? This is especially true when it comes to jewelry. From tribal adornments to contemporary chic, jewelry styles can vary dramatically based on regional influences and personal backgrounds. A guy who grew up in a setting where gold chains were the norm might have a different vibe compared to someone influenced by modern minimalist styles.

# Popular Types of Jewelry Among Men

Necklaces

When it comes to necklaces, less can definitely be more!

Simple Chains vs. Statement Pieces

Many guys appreciate a simple, elegant chain that complements a woman’s neckline without trying too hard. Think subtle gold necklaces with small pendants. But then again, some men can’t resist the allure of a chunky statement piece—a vibrant, bohemian-style necklace, for instance, can make an unforgettable impression!



Earrings

Earrings are another hot topic in the jewelry debate!

Studs, Hoops, and Hangers

Most guys can’t help but admire classic studs—especially if they’re sparkly! You can’t go wrong with simple diamond studs or even colorful gemstones. Hoops give off a fun, laid-back vibe, while long, dangling earrings can lend an air of mystery, drawing attention to your face. It’s like sending out invitations to ask, “Hey, look at me!”

Bracelets

Bracelets are versatile and add that extra layer of flair!

Delicate vs. Chunky Styles

Some guys love the delicate touch of a thin bracelet that gracefully adorns a wrist, while others might prefer the bolder, chunkier styles that have a “look at me” quality. Charm bracelets can also be a fantastic way to express personal stories—they’re like mini-conversations wrapped around your arm!



Rings

Rings can be a true reflection of personality and style!

Stackable and Statement Rings

From dainty stackable rings to bold, statement rings, this jewelry type can say a lot. A simple ring can often be quite alluring, especially when paired with a stunning manicure. Guys often dig stackable rings as they can create an eye-catching layered effect that’s both playful and sophisticated.

Jewelry and Personality

The Impact of Style on First Impressions

Not to be dramatic, but jewelry often sets the stage for first impressions! A stunning piece can give the impression of elegance and poise, while a fun piece can suggest that you’re approachable and friendly. Men tend to notice jewelry that resonates with your overall style—what you wear often speaks volumes about who you are.



Jewelry That Reflects Individuality

Just like your outfit, your jewelry can be a canvas for self-expression! Unique and quirky pieces can be a great conversation starter. If you have a love for vintage finds, a quirky brooch or an antique ring can showcase your personality while also sparking interesting chats with those around you.



The Role of Occasions

Everyday vs. Special Events Jewelry

Understanding the occasion is critical too! Everyday jewelry tends to be more subtle, like a thin chain or small earrings, while special events call for bold statements. When dressing up for a romantic dinner or a party, it’s time to let your jewelry shine bright like a diamond.



Seasonal Trends That Impress

Jewelry trends can also shift with the seasons! In spring and summer, think colorful gemstones and light, airy pieces that bring a refreshing vibe, while fall and winter often invite richer tones and heavier materials. Adapting your jewelry to seasonal trends keeps your look fresh and exciting!



Tips for Choosing Jewelry

Consider His Preferences

While it’s essential to wear what makes you happy, considering his preferences can go a long way. If he enjoys simple things, avoid overwhelming him with overly extravagant jewelry. A smaller, dainty piece can make a more significant impact than something that overwhelms his senses.



Mixing and Matching Styles

Don’t be shy about mixing styles! Layering pieces can make a big statement. Try combining vintage with modern or mixing metals; the result can be eye-catching and versatile, showing off your creativity and flair for fashion.



Quality Over Quantity

Lastly, remember that quality often trumps quantity. Investing in a few high-quality pieces can be far more impressive than a box full of cheaper items. Well-crafted jewelry can last a lifetime, making it not just a fashion statement but a cherished keepsake.



Conclusion

Ultimately, when it comes to what kind of jewelry guys like on women, the answer is crystal-clear—it’s really all about uniqueness and personal taste. Don’t be afraid to express yourself through the beautiful art of jewelry, keep your style authentic, and remember that the best accessories are the ones that make you feel confident. After all, that confidence is the biggest jewel of all!



FAQs

1\\. What is the most attractive type of jewelry for women according to men?

Men often find simple, elegant pieces like diamond studs and delicate necklaces to be the most attractive. Bold statement pieces can also catch their eye if they match a woman's personality.



2\\. Are there jewelry styles that turn guys off?

Overly flashy or extravagant pieces can sometimes be a turn-off, especially if they don’t match a woman’s style. It’s all about balance!



3\\. Should I wear matching jewelry?

Mixing and matching can add an exciting flair to your ensemble, so don’t feel pressured to have everything match exactly. Complementary pieces often look more stylish!



4\\. Do guys prefer silver or gold jewelry?

This can vary significantly based on personal taste. Some may prefer the classic look of gold, while others lean towards the modern feel of silver.



5\\. How do I choose jewelry that reflects my personality?

Choose pieces that resonate with your style and story! Whether it’s vintage finds, unique shapes, or specific colors, make sure it feels authentically “you.”

1fxg3pv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlasFeels/comments/1fxg3pv/smoking/,Smoking,"How long has it been? 5 years? Longer?

After having a large blended matcha at my usual coffee shop and a hearty beef stew at this korean spot somewhere in Cubao, I thought... I'm so full. It's raining. Why was I here again? Oh right... to spend money when I absolutely didn't have to. I could have stayed at home to binge watch on Gyeonseong Creature or Flower of Evil. 

What am I doing here? 

I passed by the washroom area... one of those public ones where you pay 5php for use. And they were selling it... for 12php a stick. These bastards are probably earning more than I do. Maybe I should switch careers. 

After years... how did it feel like? It was just lights... and I was dizzy. Like a regression into a past supposedly long forgotten.

When my ex started cheating on me, and after I was dumb enough to forgive him, he started smoking. I was furious. Not because of what he was doing but because it was an activity he picked up again because of her.

It's just a memory now... even the anger is gone. I think I could see him in a coffin now and feel nothing. 

There is liberty in this nonchalance. This emptiness. This could have been revenge if I actually cared. 

And after all this time... I still see no good reason to go back to smoking.

Backstory:

When I first got with my now partner of almost 2 years I didn't realise that they had only broken up a couple of months prior to us getting together. I only figured it out once feelings were deep, however if I had known they had broken up so recently I wouldn't have entered into something with him as I would've preferred someone who has processed their breakup. 

They broke up because she couldn't do polyamory. They fought heavily over this. Often.

He was still very much inlove with her but they decided to go their separate ways cos their values were too unaligned in regards to ENM.

I have communicated to my partner that this created alot of insecurity for me, on multiple occasions. Feeling like a rebound in a way. He said he was over her completely.. which I have always found hard to believe. 


So now.. he brings up the coffee thing saying he will go for a coffee with her. I felt uncomfortable and told him that I didn't think that this conversation was the right time or place (we were in a restaurant after a long day). He could see I was feeling uncomfortable but proceeded to tell me that he ""doesn't think he would date her again"" but would be happy to have sex with her or have an orgy with her at a party if it were to come up. 

I feel really upset about it. Like I'm open to him being with anyone, except the idea of him with an ex who isn't poly and it didn't work out with makes me feel uncomfortable. It seems like things could get messy as we also see her at events often.

Idk I feel wrong and not a ""good polyamorous person"" for saying that I wouldn't want that... it honestly feels to me I'd rather not be in a relationship with him if he were to do that. But then I don't want to feel like I'm giving him an ultimatum. 

Please help I feel very confused and alone like idk who to talk to about this except the reddit  community. ",1,1728219367.0,polyamory,1,1.0,False

We had lived together for 4 out of those 6 years. I loved her with all my soul, and still do. And she loves me too. But whenever we had fights, it would escalate and blow up. I would always be the one chasing after her to get her back. Usually the fights weren't big enough to break up, but it was a push and pull dynamic where I had to do a lot of pulling to get her back since many times she would say she wanted to break up and I begged for her back. She stated after the fact she would tend to say a lot of things she didn't mean when she was angry at me. I was always the one to cause the fights, it seemed. I felt like I had to walk on eggshells sometimes because I never want to fight with her. Sometimes I'd get the silent treatment when these arguments occurred, which meant things wouldn't be resolved for a while. Those moments in which we fought made me feel the worst of my life- I barely slept or ate, cried a lot while we went through our arguments, so much that I'd have tension headaches for hours and would end up crying more from the pain- but when we got back together, I was on cloud 9, and everything felt right again, and I slept sounder than I ever did in my life, and the most relief I've ever felt. 

We used to live close to our families but 8 months ago moved about 4 hours away from them due to her job. It requires a lot of travelling and oversight, but there would be less travelling if we moved away. I got another job and lived with her there, as I used to work in the family business and wouldn't be possible to continue from where we were. It was just us, nobody else, with occasional visits to family. 

Two weeks ago we had an argument that exploded. She thought I didn't care enough to sleep with her at a hotel every night and going to my family's in the morning when she went to work in order for me to work my job (needed to be hardwired for internet). Round trip would have been 40 miles a day. I understand that I initially made her feel that I didnt want to be with her when travelling to the location as I hadn't initially planned on doing so every night, I figured why couldnt she stay with me at my parents as a compromise some nights (but didnt communicate that until our fight)? I told her that I could go to the hotel that night (Monday) and then maybe on Friday night. I went to the hotel and stayed in the parking lot for 2 hours while we argued, wanting to go up to be with her. Eventually, I had to go to my family home to sleep as I had our pup with me and couldn't sleep in the car.  For the next days we barely communicated. A couple days after our fight. I tried to go and see her for coffee in the morning to try to smooth things out. She refused and took off her location so I couldn't see where she was. That Friday I asked if she wanted to see me over the weekend. She refused. More days went by until it was nearly a week since we saw each other. She texted me in and out during those days about miscellanous things but no affection and I did the same. On Monday, She told me she was sick and I offered some suggestions to make her feel better. I wanted to go and see her but knew she was mad and didn't know what room she was in or if she wanted to see me, which i found out she actually texted me that because she did. But didnt explicitly state she wanted me to see her.  I had been planning to go back to our home the next day, as she was going to as well initially, and to help her feel better when we were both home, as I've always helped her feel better and took care of her when we were together. 

The night before we were set to go back home, she said she needed to talk to me. We then argued on the phone for 3 hours and she told me among other things that she wanted to break up, that we had different goals in life and that I could get my stuff whenever I wanted. We tried to explain our sides of the initial fight but didn't seem to get each other. I asked her twice if she wanted to break up for real, she said yes. She even asked if she could get on dating again.

We didn't speak until 3 days later, when I texted I'd go get my stuff on the weekend. She asked if I needed help and I told her no, that my family would help. That Friday she wanted to talk to me and I initially refused, until she asked if we could talk things out to get closure the next day.  I agreed to meet with her. That day she poured her heart out to me, saying that she wouldn't try to change my mind but that she didn't mean any of the words she said, she only said them to hurt me. That she shouldn't have fought with me and that she would never have if she knew it would come down to this. I explained to her that I still loved her but it was a culmination of all our fights that boiled it down to this point. I didn't want to keep living fighting and having to walk on eggshells, and working a job I hate living away from everybody we know, as I made this sacrifice for her because I wanted to be with her and live with her. She apologized and blamed herself for everything, stating she is sorry she pushed me to my limit and she wish she never had. But if I gave her a chance she would change and go into therapy for her anger. That we had been planning a life together and get married, and she was so serious about me and she always imagined being with me until we were old (we had always thought that together). 

It was so tempting to take her back. I really still love her with all my heart. She loves me and she stated that I made her moments in life feel special, that I was all she had. She stated she knows I will be ok since I would be surrounded by my family but she has no one where we live.

It breaks my heart because I don't want to leave her alone and struggling. We were planning to marry and build a life together and now, it's all gone. I feel like I will leave her in an empty apartment surrounded only by memories and it is eating me up and making me cry. I worry for her and I don't want anything bad to happen to her. How do I deal with this guilt? She left me a voicemail late at night, thanking me for meeting with her, that she loved me and hoped I would handle the breakup better than her. I want her to be okay, and I don't want to feel like I abandoned her. Because I still love her. I want her to be happy. But I'm not sure our relationship should continue or if this should be it for good. We've had so many good times, so many good memories together.. 6 years is a long time to be with somebody and I truly thought she was my soul mate for life. 

I don't want her to suffer because of me, but I am conflicted. As of now, we are broken up, but I'm not sure how to navigate this.. ",0,1728219216.0,relationship_advice,2,0.5,False

#    Mineral Compositions of Space Capabilities 

***The most common materials in US space assets—including satellites, direct-ascent antisatellite (DA-ASAT) weapons, and rocket bodies—are metallic materials, even more so than composite and ceramic materials.10 Metallic materials with high strength-to-weight ratios, such as aluminum, titanium, and stainless steel, help reduce launch costs and increase payload capacity.11 These minerals must also withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and are often alloyed together, providing additional performance benefits.1***

# Mineral Stockpiling

 ***First, the US government should stockpile minerals necessary in US space assets to mitigate mineral supply constraints and price volatility. In contrast with other industries like the automotive industry, the US space industry relies on smaller volumes of highly specialized materials.54 Smaller demand enables easier stockpiling as smaller volumes would need to be acquired and stored. When limited mineral supplies or high mineral prices threaten to disrupt the production of US space assets, the government could sell stockpiled minerals to US space companies at fixed prices. China similarly sells stockpiled minerals to its strategic sectors, like the power sector, when high mineral prices threaten downstream production.55 The proposed stockpile would serve both strategic and economic purposes, similar to China’s mineral stockpile.56 While the US government currently employs the National Defense Stockpile, which contains many types of minerals, it is used for strategic—not economic—purposes, intended to reduce supply chain risks to the United States in the event of a national emergency, like a military conflict.57 The National Defense Stockpile is prohibited from being used as an economic stockpile that sells minerals when prices are high and purchases minerals when prices are low.58 Therefore, a new mineral stockpile specific to space assets and separate from that reserve should be created. With the lack of US refining capacity for some minerals, the government would need to stockpile highly refined metal products that US space manufacturers could incorporate into their manufacturing lines without extensive processing. The relatively small mineral demand of individual space companies does allow some companies to undertake smaller batch refining operations. For example, SpaceX, which has its own metallurgy team and foundry, produces its proprietary SX500 alloy for the Raptor rocket engines.59 Nonetheless, most US space companies do not have the resources available to SpaceX; thus, the US government should stockpile highly refined metal products that could be integrated into manufacturing lines absent considerable processing. To mitigate the industry’s limited access to refining capacity, the government should also consider how it can help companies procure the necessary processing equipment and technology to convert minerals into metals and chemicals for manufacturing space assets.***

#  Concessional Financing

 ***Second, the government should provide concessional financing for US space companies to sign long-term, fixed-price mineral offtake agreements.60 This means that the mineral producer would agree to sell the space company a certain volume of the minerals at a set price over a specific time frame to attenuate mineral supply constraints and price volatility. US space companies sometimes face limited mineral availability and higher mineral prices due to other industries’ larger demand and production cycles. For instance, the 2014 survey on titanium found that industry players expected the increased production of the Boeing 787 aircraft and Airbus A350 aircraft would increase titanium prices and lead times.6***

***Likewise, a US space company in 2012 said it faced limited availability of carbon graphite due to competing demand from the production of the A350 and A380 aircraft.62 In a competitive global market with high mineral demand, long-term offtake agreements at fixed prices could help secure minerals for the US space industry. To further strengthen US mineral supply chains, government financing of offtake agreements should require borrowing space companies first to source domestically produced minerals if domestic supplies are available and then source foreign-produced minerals from geopolitically aligned countries. Critically, if the offtake agreements are signed with production facilities in East Asia, such as Japan and South Korea, these mineral supplies could be disrupted by US-China military tensions and a US-China conflict; therefore, the US government should condition the financing of offtake agreements with production facilities in East Asia on the desired materials not being produced in other partner countries such as Canada. Lastly, mineral producers may prefer floating-price contracts over fixed-price contracts because they expect mineral prices to increase over the long term, but these producers also prefer long-term agreements due to guaranteed long-term revenue. Thus, mineral producers should be amenable to long-term, fixed-price mineral offtake agreements. While the US government has not provided financing to companies to sign offtake agreements with mineral producers, the government has signed offtake agreements directly with mineral producers before. For example, in 1951, the US government contracted with the Calera Mining Company “for the purchase of 6.5 million pounds of cobalt-nickel alloy containing not less than 93 percent cobalt and not more than 7 percent nickel at a fixed premium price,” from a mine in Lemhi County, Idaho.63 Additionally, while uranium is not considered a critical mineral—which is defined as a nonfuel mineral—the US government has also directly procured domestic uranium ore.64 Regarding the structure of the proposed policy, one existing program that holds some similarities is financing from the US Export-Import Bank, which provides financing to foreign buyers of US goods. With the proposed policy, the US government would similarly provide financing to US space companies buying critical minerals.***



# Conclusion

#  US space assets are mineral-intensive. Satellites, DA-ASAT weapons, rocket bodies, and other assets all require substantial volumes and various types of minerals. But the supply chains for minerals vital in US space assets face risks of mineral import disruptions such as export controls and interrupted shipping lanes. Such import disruptions can restrict mineral availability and cause price volatility, negatively impacting the production of US space assets. These conditions could prove particularly detrimental to the US military in a conflict with China, which itself is a major supplier of minerals to the United States. To help mitigate risks to these vital mineral supply chains, the US government with the US Space Force as the primary coordinator should stockpile minerals critical to US space assets; provide concessional financing for US space companies to sign Longterm, fixed-price mineral offtake agreements; and impose E&L tariffs on mineral imports produced in countries that do not adhere to equivalent US E&L standards. Such secure access to sufficient mineral volumes is critical for accelerated and uninterrupted production of US space assets and the preservation of US space leadership. Æ

This is the third time I have requested a trash pick up in a week. My trash can has been out since Tuesday morning and you still have not picked up. There are large dump trucks from the sewer construction and road closures, but it's been like this since I moved here in June. You've figured out a way to collect trash previously. It's a city service that I am paying for through  billing and property taxes. The construction is not going to end any time you. You can't leave East Third off of your trash route.

I am writing to report an ongoing issue regarding trash containers that has already been reported three times since June 4, 2024. Despite previous reports, the containers remain in place, which continues to be a nuisance to the neighborhood. It is a violation of city code to store trashcans so close to the sidewalk, and this situation has not been addressed.

I kindly request that appropriate action be taken to resolve this issue in accordance with city regulations.

The building is in a super convenient location, 5 minutes away from target, Trader Joe’s, and Whole Foods. It’s also right by a ton of trains (2, 3, 4, 5, Q, R, D, and more!). 

It’s close to Brooklyn Heights, Fort Greene, and by a ton of cool restaurants and coffee shops! It’s also right down the street from one of my favorite bookstores, the Center for Fiction :) 

The building is a doorman building with a gym, lounge, game room, and rooftop with grills! The people who work here are phenomenal and incredibly nice, they really go above and beyond to make sure we’re doing ok ❤️

Apartment details: 
Rent is $3000 a month and is available starting November 22nd. The lease ends March 8, 2025 with the option to renew. Water and gas is included, you would just need to pay for electric and WiFi! 

Not furnished, but open to selling some of the furniture (can send pics if interested).

The security deposit (one month’s rent) would be paid up front!

I rescued an abused dog a few months ago, he's a very kind soul,   he essentially spent 2 months afraid to leave his crate hiding.  I've given him time and space he's opened up so much, he currently thinks he is sneaking into my lap. I mean who would notice a 70 lbs dog getting in their lap slowly.

He has two behaviors I would like to modify.

The first is things in my hands are scary. the bigger the scarier.  Guns and axes are things from horror movies to him axes need a 10 distance.  I hunt, and heat with a wood stove. But how can I encourage him to not be afraid of things in my hand

The second he seems afraid of my scooping powders.flour sugar coffee grounds, salt.

I would like him to be a bit interested in what I'm doing not necessarily under my feet I don't want him to get stepped, burnt or hurt.   But I don't want to have to hide things behind my back.  ",2,1728218351.0,DogAdvice,3,1.0,False

Also open to anything from platonic to something serious. Just putting myself out there and seeing what happens!

A little about me:

* I absolutely love music - whether it's playing guitar, spinning vinyl (I love collecting and listening to records), or going to concerts. It'd be great to find a more concert friends! Let me know what upcoming concerts you're going to!
* I also love spending time outside with my dog. He's got a cute outdoorsy name but you'll have to message me to find out what it is haha. We go on all sorts of adventures running, hiking, camping, paddle boarding, and hammocking.
* Recently I've been getting more into coffee and I think it'd be super fun to have someone to share a virtual coffee/tea with almost daily if time allows and the interest is there. I don't have to work until 9:00 AM most days and I get up early and usually just listen to one side of a record before heading to work. But it'd be fun to spend that time having a nice morning chat with someone while we sip on our drinks.

I know that physical attraction is important and I'm happy to exchange photos early-on to determine if there's mutual physical attraction. But to give you a quick idea of what I look like, I'm white, 6'3"", 170 lbs, (tall and trim lol), blond hair, and my friends (and even strangers) frequently compliment my mustache haha.

At the restaurant, setting up to rehearse.

We had such a nice sendoff for Lolita last night! Everyone will see her off today except Heidi and me. They have a long busride to Maine. She looked so excited last night!!!

The restaurant has a lot of reservations. They asked whether we could squeeze in a third show. We will squeeze in a middle ""original Jammy"" show. The girls want me to rest before I sing again. OK, I'll watch from the floor and drink coffee.

I think I did good yesterday or so I'm told. But I really don't remember much. Its like a blur. The hardest note for me to hit was the opening to April in Paris. I don't know how Frank did it. He just hit it without anyone leading with a chord. Or maybe he sung what he wanted and the musicians had to adjust their key? IDK. I had to ask Heidi to play a four bar into. Maybe today I can do it like Frank",1,1728217993.0,LoHeidiLita,0,1.0,False

Hello,

My wife and I are planning a 2500ft2 self-build for our family of four. We spent a lot of time figuring out what we wanted to attempt to fit into our space:

* Entrance hall with concealed storage for shoes/jackets/bags
* Living/Dining/kitchen combined area with vaulted ceiling/oak trusses
* Living with seating for at least 8. Entertainment wall and separate focal log stove
* The kitchen should have a good-sized island suitable for seating 4+ people
* Wet/coffee bar in the kitchen area
* Dining table with access for at least 10 people
* walk-in pantry
* Master bedroom big enough for entertainment wall + glass/windowed wall
* Master bedroom nook for PC/workstation
* 3 additional bedrooms (2 with built-in wardrobes)
* Kid's nook/play area
* Communal shower room for bedrooms but accessible for living space
* Master bedroom with luxury ensuite and walk-in wardrobe
* Utility room accessible through an external entrance and master closet for dogs and washing
* Home office accessible through an exclusive external entrance
* Double garage

Living in Scotland, we need to be conscious of our neighbouring houses which typically have stone cladding and/or timber cladding and/or white render finish. We have attempted to create the living space to replicate an old Scottish stedding (stone clad) with a modern take at either side (white render).

We are also designing to a budget-friendly design, hence the simple shape, as we would rather put our spare money into the finishings like exposed trusses, kitchen and bathrooms VS a technical/complex shape/design.

Would love some constructive feedback to help improve the plans we have.

**NOTE:** I am not an architect and we're planning this through research, trial and error.  
We used [Floorplanner.com](http://Floorplanner.com) to create the plans and renders.
