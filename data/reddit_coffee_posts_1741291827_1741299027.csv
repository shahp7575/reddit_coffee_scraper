On my Oracle Jet, when selecting a long black, the machine does the grinding, pulls the shot then adds the water, but then pulls an additional shot after the water.

Is that normal?

Would have thought it would just do the shots, and finish with the water.

1j57h61,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1j57h61/the_forgotten_dreamer/,The Forgotten Dreamer,"Dr. Samuel Reed adjusted his glasses as he scanned the file in front of him. The latest subject, Daniel Holt, had checked into the Institute for Sleep Research three nights ago, suffering from chronic insomnia and vivid nightmares. The experimental treatment involved deep sleep stimulation—a method designed to enhance REM cycles through low-frequency brainwave induction. The project had shown promise in preliminary trials, but Daniel’s case was unique. His insomnia had worsened over the past year, and none of the conventional treatments had helped.

Dr. Reed glanced at the clock. 11:45 p.m. It was time.

""Are you ready, Daniel?"" Dr. Reed asked, his voice calm yet clinical. He had conducted this experiment multiple times before, but something about tonight felt different.

Daniel nodded hesitantly. ""Yeah… I guess."" His voice wavered, betraying the nervous energy beneath his composed exterior. He adjusted his position on the hospital-like bed in Room 306, exhaling shakily. The sterile white walls, the constant beeping of monitors, and the scent of antiseptic made him uneasy. He had always hated hospitals.

A nurse, Clara, approached with a clipboard. ""Just relax, Mr. Holt. We’ll monitor everything. If anything feels off, we’ll be right here.""

Daniel gave a weak smile, but deep down, he wasn’t so sure. His nightmares weren’t just bad dreams. They felt real. Too real. He had woken up screaming on multiple occasions, drenched in sweat, unable to shake the feeling that something had followed him back from the dream world.

Clara gently placed a set of electrodes on his temples, pressing them into place with careful precision. ""All set. Dr. Reed, we’re ready.""

Dr. Reed tapped a few commands into the terminal, and the overhead lights dimmed. A low-frequency hum filled the room as the sleep-inducing machine powered up, its rhythmic vibrations syncing with Daniel’s brainwaves.

""I need you to take slow, deep breaths,"" Dr. Reed instructed. ""Let yourself drift.""

Daniel did as he was told. His eyelids felt heavier with each passing second. The room faded into a blur. The last thing he saw was Dr. Reed scribbling something in his notes, his face unreadable.

As the sedation took full effect, Daniel's body relaxed completely. His heart rate slowed. His breathing became deep and even. The monitors registered stable readings.

But then… something changed.

A flicker on the screen. A brief surge in brain activity. A spike that shouldn't have been there.

Dr. Reed frowned, his fingers tightening around his pen. ""That’s unusual…"" he muttered.

Clara leaned in. ""What is it?""

""His readings are off the charts. I’ve never seen brainwave activity like this before. It’s as if… he’s entering a REM state faster than normal.""

The monitor beeped faster. Daniel’s eyes darted beneath his eyelids, his fingers twitching.

""Increase observation frequency,"" Dr. Reed ordered. ""Let’s see how deep he goes.""

Clara nodded, adjusting the settings on the machine.

Inside Daniel’s mind, something shifted. He felt like he was falling—faster, deeper, through an endless tunnel of darkness. Distant whispers echoed around him, voices he couldn’t understand. Then, just as suddenly as it began, the falling stopped.

He was standing in a room.

But it wasn’t Room 306.

It was a small apartment, dimly lit by the flickering glow of a neon sign outside the window. The hum of city traffic drifted in. A coffee table sat in front of him, covered in scattered papers and an empty whiskey glass. A framed photograph rested on the table.

He picked it up.

The picture showed a man and a woman, smiling. The man looked… familiar. Daniel's heart pounded as he traced his finger over the image. It was him. But not him.

The woman in the photo? He had never seen her before in his life.

Then, from behind him, a voice whispered.

""James… you’re home.""

1j579x1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j579x1/orion_pest_control_victor_trusted_me_with_a/,Orion Pest Control: Victor Trusted Me With A Chainsaw,"[Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/T0EBpq7QpC)

Remember how I said that things were about to get ugly around here? Ugly turned out to be an understatement. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U) 

For starters, we were forced to take more aggressive measures with the Wood Maiden. That may be shocking news for some of you, considering how much effort we put into trying to resolve things without escalating to violence if possible. However, after repeated attempts at trying to reason with her, it became abundantly clear that she had no intentions of halting her vendetta.

It was Reyna’s turn to accompany Deirdre to the Wood Maiden’s territory. The first thing they noticed was an abandoned vehicle, covered in snow as if it had been sitting overnight. Then once they ventured into the woods, they were greeted by the sight of a man’s head impaled atop a shrub. There were small birds pecking at his empty eye sockets and nostrils. His gaping mouth revealed that they’d made a nest upon his gray tongue that extended back into his throat.

This poor soul was someone from the next town over, who'd been reported missing by his daughter when he never came home from an early morning ice fishing trip. 

We’d tried to do things with compassion, knowing that the Wood Maiden was acting out of anguish, hoping that a treatment plan similar to what we use for a False Tree would suffice. Unfortunately, she was having none of it. 

Meanwhile, our county is still in a bit of a food shortage because of the Hunger Grass she’d planted. In addition, those who’d gotten sick from the Grass were experiencing complications from the extreme malnourishment they’d been subjected to, even after the curse was broken. And on top of that, she was continuing to lure unsuspecting individuals into her woods. 

It was undeniable that bodies would only continue to pile up until something drastic happened. As such, our focus has switched from simply trying to make contact with the Wood Maiden to finding her tree. If we could locate the one that she was bound to, she wouldn't be able to evade us any longer. 

I was hoping that it wouldn't come to having to kill her. Don’t get me wrong, the Wood Maiden had caused widespread suffering in her rage. She needed to be stopped by any means necessary. But after decades - possibly even centuries - of watching her forest shrink with each expansion, a part of me couldn't help but sympathize. 

To top it off, while my coworkers and I were in the middle of having this dreadful discussion about how to proceed, we got a call from another specialty pest control company located up near Lake Erie, Rodent N Roach Pest Solutions. Deirdre's eyes went wide when she answered the phone, waving Victor and I over as she put it on loudspeaker. 

The corporation’s manager sounded like she needed a nap and a strong cup of coffee. “I was approached by a client in regards to an active Wood Maiden in your operating area and was just curious about why they're asking us instead of you.”

Apparently, the developers offered this other pest control company an exorbitant amount of money to kill the Wood Maiden. We're talking four times this other company's usual rate, plus travel expenses. I was *floored*. Judging by my coworkers’ equally baffled reactions, I wasn't the only one. 

When the manager found this incredibly generous offer to be suspect, she called us to get our side of the story. Victor was more than willing to give it to her, spilling the tea about the trouble associated with the development company’s previous projects and how all of that led up to the current situation. 

At the end of it, the manager released a heavy exhale before saying, “Yeah, I'm not touching *any* of that with a fifty foot pole.”

In the end, the manager wished us luck, then hung up. For a moment, nobody spoke. Victor looked beyond exasperated. Deirdre stared at the phone as if expecting it to suddenly give her answers; if the landline had any advice, it was keeping it to itself. Reyna, eyes huge with worry, glanced between all of us. Wes simply looked dead inside, eyes half lidded,  weighed down by mental exhaustion.

Personally, I just wanted to bash my head against a wall and call it a day. Hell, call it a year. We can end 2025 early as a treat. 

Wes ended up being the one to break the silence. “So, if another company shows up, just how badly is that going to fuck things up for us?” 

“That depends,” Victor grunted, face drawn in agitation. “Not all specialty pest control is created equal. For instance, there was another company here before Orion, and then another before them.”

“Ajax Pest Control, then the Rohrs.” Deirdre provided, then when Victor gave her a curious look, she explained gravely. “I washed all of the Rohrs’ shirts. The losses were so great that the river ran red.” 

Victor had told me that other companies had failed in this area in the past, though he wasn't sure what they'd done to incur the Neighbors’ wrath. 

Reyna let out a shaky breath at this news. Specialty companies being annihilated is a tough topic. We all know inherently that it’s a possibility; each case we go on could potentially be our last. Hell, I daresay we came dangerously close to that point on Samhain, between the Dullahan and the Wild Hunt's Halloween party. Whenever the subject comes up, the atmosphere gets tense.

“So… what's the plan?” I asked eventually.

Rubbing the bridge of his nose, Victor elaborated, “Business as usual. We find the Wood Maiden's tree. That takes precedence over everything else. And if any other specialties come sniffing around, have them call me. I'll handle it.”

That specialty pest control company wasn't the only one we heard from. 

A couple others contacted us, thankfully being wise enough to scope out the situation before taking a lucrative deal. To summarize, the developers had been making the rounds all around Pennsylvania, Ohio, and the northern panhandle of West Virginia. 

This put us on a deadline. We had to find the Wood Maiden before someone else took up the developers’ on their offer. We didn't want to take the chance of one coming in and mishandling the situation. Like the boss said, not all specialty companies are created equal. 

On the subject of the developers, something that I found curious was that they didn't appear to be seeking out any self-proclaimed monster hunters for this task. Only specialties. For as long as I've been here, the development company always reasoned away the locals’ and our warnings about the Neighbors as superstitions, refusing to acknowledge the existence of them until recently. 

You'd think that if they truly weren't knowledgeable about townies’ folk tales, they wouldn't be reaching out exclusively to specialists. They'd do what certain potential clients do and contract out to the lowest “capable” bidder. That makes me wonder if they'd truly been ignorant, or if they'd always known the truth and just tried to brush it under the rug. 

I don't know. I can't say for sure if anything nefarious is going on. Assume incompetence before maliciousness. But it is fishy. 

We couldn't afford to waste time, so Deirdre and I opted to venture out to the Wood Maiden’s forest after that first phone call to get a head start on things. Considering that The Girlfriend and I both have the illustrious privilege of being able to see things we shouldn't, that seemed to make the most sense. 

That, and I'd never pass up the chance on spending more time with her. Even with living and working together, we haven't seen much of each other lately thanks to how busy we've both been. Wandering around in the woods looking for a homicidal Wood Maiden isn't anyone's idea of a dream date, sure, but I'd take what I could get. 

On the subject of Deirdre, I do have an update about her condition, and it’s a big one: she was able to feel a kiss for the first time.

Once I got home from dealing with the walking rat quilt, I desperately needed something to take my mind off of that ordeal. One would think that since my life *is* a horror movie that I wouldn’t enjoy them so much. Maybe it’s because seeing other people suffer like my colleagues and I do makes me feel less alone, even if it is just all fiction. Or maybe it’s because at the end of the day, the monster or murderer takes off their mask and it’s all over. The cast all gets to wash off the cheesy, too-red gore that they’re covered in, then go home once the credits roll. 

Seeing how exhausted and disturbed I was, Deirdre had suggested watching *The Thing*, even though she said it makes her paranoid. If yinz recall, I said in my last post that I suspected that she does this as an excuse to cuddle up to me. I now have confirmation. 

She’d looked up at me with puppy-dog eyes while inching closer to me, saying, “I know it isn’t real, but… I’m so afraid!”

Anyways, I fell into her trap like the jagoff I am by holding her closer and giving her a soft peck on the lips. That was when her eyes went wide.

Again, like a dumbass, I thought that she had simply been startled by the movie. “Don’t worry, this isn’t the part where the guy’s stomach turns into a mouth.”

(On another note, I better not find any comments about me spoiling a movie from the 80’s for anyone. If you haven’t watched it by now, that’s your own damn fault.)

“I *felt* you!” She exclaimed, beaming as her hand rose to subtly touch her lips.

I blinked at her as the information sank into my exhausted, smooth brain, then I was smiling along with her. 

Playfully, I told her, “Are you sure? We should probably do it again. Y’know, for science.” 

Deirdre’s cheeks turned an adorable shade of pink as she scooted back into my arms to confirm our hypothesis. 

…Good God. Maybe Reyna has a point when she calls me a cringelord. Why do yinz read these posts, again? 

Anyways, there are hellish matters to discuss. I’ll start off by saying that Deirdre’s newfound sensory perception is the only good news I have to share. 

To my relief, there were no cadavers (or pieces of them, more accurately) waiting for us when we arrived. No other cars. No signs of life other than the birds chirping incessantly on the first tolerable day. However, I didn’t trust it. You’d be hard-pressed to find a bird that isn’t loyal to whichever Neighbor has the closest proximity to them. I wouldn’t be surprised if the Wood Maiden had enlisted their aid in plucking that poor man’s eyes out. 

Warily, I checked Deirdre’s shadow. It was intact. That rippling effect had decreased some. No shadow bird, either. 

“The Wood Maiden’s probably expecting us.” I told her, readying my supplies. 

We got something new for this case specifically: a chainsaw. 

Again, I had mixed feelings about facing the possibility of having to cut down her tree. But if it needed done, then it needed done. If it came down to it, I’d just have to stomach the guilt as best as I could.

“Even with the second sight, I don’t imagine that finding her tree will be easy.” Deirdre commented. 

Crunching over fallen twigs with the chainsaw in hand, keeping my eye out for any signs of sudden movement, I replied, “I figured as much, especially since we don’t even know what we’re looking for.”

After a moment of hesitation, Deirdre asked, “Would you be opposed if I tried one last time to draw her out peacefully?” 

I paused. “Uh, I’m holding a chainsaw and a sword made by an evil bastard, so I should probably wait outside the forest if you’re going to do that.”

She smiled sheepishly, “If you don’t mind.”

Worth a shot, right? 

I told her to yell if *anything* seemed off, even if a leaf moved the wrong way. With her having sensation again, she was more vulnerable than ever. She promised that she’d be careful, then I was on my way.

Her song followed me out:

*“Óró, sé do bheatha 'bhaile,
Óró, sé do bheatha 'bhaile,
Óró, sé do bheatha 'bhaile,
Anois ar theacht an tsamhraidh.”*

A car door slammed. What? Who was here? Keeping the chainsaw’s blade pointed downwards, I broke into a run back towards the forest’s threshold.

*“Tá Gráinne Mhaol ag teacht thar sáile,
Óglaigh armtha léi mar gharda,
Gaeil iad féin is ní Frainc ná Spáinnigh,
Is cuirfidh siad ruaig ar Ghallaibh.”*

Once I reached it, my eyes fell upon a black van. The side of it was emblazoned with the words, ELKS Pest Solutions, featuring the outline of a bugling elk bull; the antlers reminded me uncomfortably of the White Son of Mist. Their phone number was listed, as well as their address. Apparently, these guys came all the way from Clearfield County. 

Those that emerged from the van wore balaclavas. For context, some specialists feel the need to do more than use fraudulent names to conceal their identities, but in our experience, coverings only make a real difference on Samhain. Generally speaking, if something is determined enough to find you, it will. 

They all stiffened when they saw me. Can’t say I blame them, considering that I was openly staring at them with a sword on my hip and a chainsaw in my hand. I probably looked like the most normal member of Leatherface's family. 

“Hello,” I greeted them, sliding the chainsaw to the ground so that they wouldn't feel threatened. “I’m with Orion Pest Control. I come in peace. We’re in the process of dealing with an aggressive Wood Maiden.”

The driver glanced at his colleagues, then went back to me. Judging by his accent, he was from deep in the ‘hollers,’ “You on the same call as us?”

It hadn’t taken the real estate fuckers very long to hire someone, after all. Excellent. Just what we needed. 

“We have it under control. We just need some space to get the issue resolved.” I told him quickly.

He approached me, hands held out in a confused shrug, “Now, hold on a second. We drove ‘bout two hours to be here under the impression that this was a five-alarm emergency.”

“And I’m terribly sorry that your time was wasted.” I replied sincerely. “Truly, I am. I’d be irate if I were in your shoes. But with the way things have been going, I’m worried…”

I trailed off when I noticed a crow gliding down to perch on a nearby branch. Not a regular one, but a mangled mess of limbs utilized by the Hunt. Another joined it. Then another. Not good. 

It didn’t escape the ELKS employees’ notice either. The driver had noticeably tensed up, immediately averting his eyes from the accursed birds. 

The employee that had been in the passenger seat - the tallest of the three - cautiously asked, “If they've seen us already, there's nothing we can do, right?”

The driver confirmed before I could, “If we try runnin’, it'll just give them an excuse to chase us. Best to just wait and hope that they're in a listenin’ mood. And R? Mind their eyes.”

Okay. So I wasn't dealing with a bunch of amateurs or bumbling idiots, like the poor duo Iolo butchered a few months’ back. That was good, at least. 

I warned them about the mechanic’s music, Briar's thorns, and the Houndmaster’s dogs respectively. While their presence was a massive inconvenience, I couldn't blame them. They were misled and just trying to do their jobs, same as us. However, I knew that the mechanic most likely wouldn't see things that way. 

The driver had thanked me for the information, telling me that they had Hunters of their own over in Clearfield County. Although, according to him, theirs have been known to gut their victims, filling their torsos with straw and rocks, then erected into the fields like scarecrows. Sometimes the souls are left inside of their mangled bodies until the Hunters have decided that they've had enough. 

In summary, let's pray that the mechanic and the Clearfield Hunters never meet. Wouldn't want them exchanging ideas. 

The three lined the inside of the van with salt, considering that the wind made making a circle outside impossible. In the meantime, more crows had appeared. Their whispery chatters sounded like laughter. 

Wait. Deirdre had stopped singing. Why did she stop?

The third employee, who hadn't uttered a word up until this point, urged me, “What are you waiting for? Get in here!”

“I'll be fine,” I said hurriedly, starting to head back into the forest. “Just stay where you are and if you hear music, don't listen to it!”

Leaving their well-intentioned protests behind, I lugged the chainsaw along as I told myself that as long as they stayed in the van with a barrier of salt, that would offer them some semblance of safety from the mechanic. But the unease in my gut disagreed. 

However, I could only worry about one thing at a time. They were armed. They knew what was coming for them. Meanwhile, Deirdre was all alone in the woods with a hostile guardian of the forest. Her danger was not only more immediate, but more distressing. I didn't want anything to happen to her. Not again. She's just getting her humanity back. 

When I got back to the spot where we'd parted ways, I wasn't surprised to discover that she wasn't there. With the rapid snow melt thanks to the forty-degree heatwave, the forest floor was reduced to a slippy, mucky mess. Deirdre’s footprints revealed that she had lost her footing briefly, regained balance, then proceeded deeper into the forest. With how messy they were, she must've been in a hurry. 

Had she been running towards something or away? I followed in her footsteps, terrified it was the latter. 

I knew better than to call her name, as much as I needed the assurance that she was okay. Even though Deirdre wasn't her real one, it would still be unwise for various other reasons, one of those being drawing attention to myself. 

There was a scream up ahead. *Deirdre.* 

It could've just been an illusion; the Wood Maiden had used her likeness against me before. But I wasn't taking that chance. I hurried towards it, heart pounding as I dodged fallen branches and flailed to avoid falling in the mud. The chainsaw's weight made balancing more difficult than usual as the gasoline within sloshed violently with each stumble.

Something snagged the back of my coat. Too strong to be a branch. The insectoid shadow on the ground next to me revealed the mechanic, much to my chagrin. 

“It ain't her,” He informed me mildly, releasing my jacket. “Wood Maiden's fuckin’ with you.”

What was he doing here? Oh God. *The ELKS.*

Though I was afraid to hear the answer, I demanded, “What did you do to them?”

He played dumb, raising his eyebrows innocently, “Who?”

“The other pest control company that was here.”

“Ah, them.” He shrugged as if my reaction was unreasonable. “They ain't dead, don't get yourself all worked up. They're just helpin’ out with this whole construction problem.”

“What do you mean by that?” 

Iolo smiled then nodded behind me. Reluctantly, I followed his gaze, seeing a trio of small birds in a tree. One fluttered close to land on a branch right in front of my nose, putting us eye to eye. A cute, round little thing. The top of its head was black, lined by white cheeks like it was wearing a tiny hat. The rest of its body was white, accentuated with paintbrush streaks of black.  

A blackpoll warbler. 

Its shining black eyes stared into mine, as if pleading with me. My blood chilled as the dots connected in my head. 

Eyes wide, I turned back to Iolo, “You *didn't!*”

Mockingly, he replied, “Oh, *I* did.”

“How- they were in the van-” I stammered. 

“Somethin' I love ‘bout you pest control types? You're all bleedin’ hearts. They heard that scream and came right on out.” He explained while grinning like the devil. 

Being turned into a dog had been excruciating, worse than anything I'd ever felt in my entire life. I don't doubt that the ELKS' transformations were equally as torturous. And I remembered Iolo saying something about how over time, I'd become convinced I always *was* a dog. I would've lost myself, if either I or Victor hadn't cooperated. 

I turned on the mechanic, asking, “How long do they have until they forget that they're human?”

One of the birds chirped. This must've been shocking news for them. It definitely had been for me. 

Leaning against a tree, arms crossed, Iolo thoughtfully replied, “Depends. Some people lose it in less than a day. Others can hold on to their sense of self for ‘bout a week.”

Less than twenty-four hours to a week. What a window. 

The mechanic continued, “The Department of Wildlife is plannin’ on doing another inspection here at around noon. Long as these endangered sons of bitches cooperate, I'd be willin’ to *consider* changin’ ‘em back.”

The way he said ‘consider’ told me that he wasn't being entirely sincere. And even if he was, that wasn't definite. He wanted something. What else was new? Begrudgingly, I asked him what that was. 

His gaze was icy as he said, “That'll depend on how you handle what lies ahead.”

I wanted to demand what he meant by that, but with the ELKS’ humanity on the line, I didn't want to risk pissing him off. 

Quietly, I promised the transformed specialist in front of me, “I'll come back for you. Just do as he says and try to hang in there, alright? I'm *so* sorry you all got roped into this.”

The bird's small head jerked up and down in what appeared to be an attempt to nod at me. 

Redirecting my attention back to the banjo bastard, I told him, “I need to deal with the Wood Maiden first, then I'll be back.”

He shrugged, saying amicably, “That's fine. I can be patient!”

Mind racing as I tried to figure out what the hell to do, the bastard called after me, “Oh, and Fiona? You can't trust your ears. Don't let yourself get tricked again. Hell, I might not even be real for all you know! Could all just be an illusion!”

I was glad that he couldn't see me rolling my eyes, but by the way he laughed afterwards, he already knew that he'd succeeded in simultaneously frightening and irritating me. 

While I continued to follow Deirdre’s prints, I heard another scream, but it was one that came deep from the recesses of my memories. A marrow-chilling shriek that had haunted me for years after I heard it. The cry of a client who'd had his ears torn off by a transformed Housekeeper. His tongue was removed next before either Vic or I could get to him. He'd ended up having a heart attack from the shock of it all. 

That was the first bad case I'd ever had. This was also the incident that earned me the jagged scar at the corner of my mouth. That transformed Housekeeper had been a particularly vicious one. 

The Wood Maiden was making it clear that she wasn't above dealing low blows. 

My grandmother's voice told me that I was worthless as I followed Deirdre’s tail. A shape that looked to be the same height as Grandma had lingered in the corner of my vision. Her imposter's shadow was in the same direction that Deirdre had been headed. Grimly, I figured that if the Wood Maiden was digging this deep into my psyche, that meant that I was hot on her heels. 

As I pressed on, my father sneered at me that I was just like him. Unlike Grandma's imposter, he weakly crawled along the ground in front of me. Nausea rippled in my stomach even as I refused to look directly at his exposed nerve endings and raw muscle. I flinched as his stump of an arm grasped for me. 

All around me, a crowd of ghosts jeered with each step I took. Family. Friends. Clients. Soldiers. There was blood in my mouth. I'd bitten my tongue as I heard one of the kids that we lost to Auntie Rye tell me that it was my fault that he'd never grow old. 

By the time that I found the end to Deirdre’s tracks, a lot of old wounds had been ripped open. And once I saw that the Wood Maiden had Deirdre by the throat, holding her off the ground, I forgot all about compassion. 

While I yanked on the cord to start up the chainsaw, the Wood Maiden's head snapped in my direction. It revved in my hand, but didn't start. *Oh, come ON!* I pulled it again. Just like before, it *vroomed,* but didn't turn on. 

While she was distracted, Deirdre withdrew her knife and buried it into the Wood Maiden's forearm, causing the Neighbor to release her on reflex. By this time, I'd finally gotten the chainsaw to roar to life. Meanwhile, Deirdre was gagging, trying to get air back into her lungs. She was shaking, eyes wide, scrambling away from her assailant. 

All I wanted to do was go to her. Drop to my knees in the mud next to her and make sure that she was okay. It killed me that I couldn't. 

More whispers echoed through the forest as the Wood Maiden prowled towards me, her face set in a scowl. One of the voices she used against me then was Iolo's, telling me that if I killed her, that would only prove that I belonged to him. 

The Wood Maiden was fast, slinking towards me in seconds as her long claws reached for my eyes. One thing I can say for the banjo bastard is that since training with him, the Neighbors’ overwhelming quickness doesn't faze me as much as it used to. I ducked away on reflex, about to swing the chainsaw at her when I noticed a birch tree covered in the same peculiar pincushion moss that had been growing on the men that she had enslaved. 

She went for me again, extending a graceful claw out towards my chest. She was reaching for my heart. Trying to make me like the moss men. I backpedalled out of the way, almost getting nicked in the process. 

Unexpectedly, the Wood Maiden stumbled, her mouth gaping open in a mixture of shock and pain. I followed her gaze to see that Deirdre, still on the ground, had driven her knife into the tree's trunk, leaving a green gash in its wood. 

“Will you please *listen*?!” Deirdre yelled, the desperation in her voice making my heart break.

The Wood Maiden’s agonized expression slowly morphed into one of hatred as she spat, “The time for listening has long passed.”

Before either of us could respond, she lept towards Deirdre. I darted after her, intending to get between them. Deirdre curled up, her arms shielding her face as the Wood Maiden bore down on her with her claws. Panic overtook me as I heard Deirdre cry out.

Acting purely on emotion, I swiped the chainsaw across the birch's trunk. A sweet, earthy smell emanated from the gash I created. To my tearful relief, the Wood Maiden had stopped her attack as an identical injury appeared in her side, the fabric of her dress tearing as if I'd put the chainsaw through her flesh.

*I didn't want things to be like this. But you're not giving us a choice.*

The Wood Maiden advanced on me, abandoning Deirdre on the ground. As my conscience screamed at me, I deepened the cut in the birch. The sweet smell reminiscent of cut grass became even more intense as the Wood Maiden put a hand over her torn side. I'd expected her to come after me; that's why I'd done this in the first place. Wanting to draw her attention away from Deirdre. But she raised her claw towards my fallen girlfriend again, teeth showing like a feral animal.

My heart pounded as I cut more, getting halfway through the trunk. The Wood Maiden doubled over, the top half of her severed torso twisting involuntarily at an absurd angle. Deirdre crab-walked out of her reach, wincing as blood poured from the deep scrapes in her arms. The birch creaked, followed by a deafening splintering sound as gravity began to pull it apart. Likewise, the Wood Maiden's abdomen simply snapped in half, falling away from her legs at the same time as the birch hit the ground. Her entrails spilled out like wet noodles, fanning out as if trying to escape.

The Wood Maiden’s eyes and mouth gaped, a guttural grunt being the only sound she could make. She was still alive. Instantly, I discarded the chainsaw to withdraw Ratcatcher so that I could cut her head off. The sounds and movements ceased after that.

As horrible as her actions were, there was no reason to prolong her suffering.

*Deirdre.*

She was struggling to stand. I hurried over, helping her up and embracing her, kissing the top of her head. She sniffled, wrapping her arms around me.

“Stupid question, but are you okay?” I muttered into her hair.

Her voice quivering, she whispered, “It hurts.”

I released her in an attempt to check on her injuries, but she squeezed me tighter, burying her face into my chest. After that, I just kept holding her, stroking her back and telling her about how incredible she is and meaning every word of it. 

Understandably, it took some time for her to calm down. Once she came out of hiding and nodded at me, her eyes spiderwebbed red from crying, I gently inspected the gashes that the Wood Maiden’s claws had left in her forearms. They were deep enough that small yellow globules of fat were visible.

While I fussed with a roll of gauze that I kept in my toolbelt for emergencies, wrapping it around the slashes, I told her, “We need to get you out of here.”

It didn't take long for the gauze to darken as the cuts struggled to clot. Deirdre looked even more pale than normal, gray eyes dazed and unfocused. Worried about her fainting, I kept an arm around her waist to support her on our trek back out of the forest.

I had to get her to a hospital. That was certain. The Wood Maiden had messed her up pretty good. God, I wish we hadn't parted ways. We should've stuck together. I know Deirdre had wanted to try to help the Wood Maiden one last time, and for the record, I had, too. However, in hindsight, we should've known better. Known better than to separate and to think that it would work.

And now Deirdre was hurt over it. 

Afterwards, once she got patched up, she actually *scolded* me from her hospital bed while her arms were covered in enough wrappings to qualify her as a living mummy.

“Don’t you *dare* blame yourself for this, Nessa.” She’d told me sternly, knowing me well enough to read my mind. “*I* was the fool that chose to pursue her on my own. *I* was the one that got *myself* hurt. If I catch you beating yourself up over it, so *help* me, woman, I'll give you a clatter!”

Yup. She actually called me ‘woman.’ The painkillers made her go full Irish on me. 

Eventually, the adorable spitfire I call a girlfriend fell into what I hoped was a peaceful sleep, facilitated by the medications she'd been given. The doctor had said she wanted to keep Deirdre overnight to make sure that her injuries didn't develop any unexpected complications. For context, we'd told them it was an animal attack.

A part of me was terrified that pincushion moss would begin to grow out of the slices in Deirdre’s arms. Her shadow looked the same as it had before we went into the woods, but that didn't satisfy my unease.

Once Deirdre was out, I took a second to gently brush away a stray lock of hair that had fallen across her face, noting how she looked and having to fight off guilt again. Meanwhile, I hadn't forgotten about the ELKS and in the back of my mind, I'd been working over how to get them out of this. 

I could always challenge him. If I won, he'd have to let them go. However, if I lost, that meant that they'd be blackpoll warblers forever.

Still, Iolo had heard me promise the transformed specialists that I'd return, and he would hold me to it. No matter what, I had to go back out into the woods that night, lest I face the consequences of breaking a promise made in the presence of a Neighbor. 

Before doing so, I wanted to get a hold of Reyna first, see if she'd be willing to sit with Deirdre in my stead. I didn't want her to be alone. Not just because I was concerned for her, but also because this was her first time ever experiencing modern medical care. It had been a huge shock for her, especially when they gave her an injection prior to suturing her injuries closed. They'd also felt inside the wound for any debris before closing it up. During the procedure, she'd squeezed my hand so hard that I'd thought my fingers would break. 

Reyna had been sympathetic, opting to come by once she was done disposing of some mice she removed from our local high school. Before leaving, I checked on Deirdre again, seeing that she was still slumbering soundly. I located a dry-erase marker and a napkin so that I could write down where I was going and why, then assured her that Reyna was on the way. I also drew a couple of stick figures kissing surrounded by a heart.

Try as I might, I don't think I'm very good at being romantic. Feel free to drop some advice in the comments: I need a non-smoothbrained opinion. (As long as it's not from the horny jail. I love yinz dearly, but *no.*)

With great hesitation, I dropped a light kiss on her forehead before slipping away. She let out a soft, precious hum as she stirred slightly, then went still once again. 

Darkness was falling by the time I got back to where the ELKS Pest Solutions van sat abandoned. It looked so forlorn sitting there, like a massive metal tombstone. Nearby, I saw piles of clothes, left on the ground as their owners were contorted into much smaller bodies.

Using my flashlight, I tried to find my way back to where I'd last seen the mechanic and the ELKS. Everything looked different in the dark. It was disorienting. 

I heard a series of high-pitched, squeaking chirps, then a flutter of wings nearby. A warbler flew into the beam of my flashlight. The fact that the transformed ELKS employee had come near me was a good sign, indicating that at least that one of them hadn't devolved into primal instinct yet.

“Do yinz still remember who you are?” I asked uneasily. “One chirp for yes, two for no.”

One chirp. That lessened some of the tension in my chest.

Next, I questioned, “Can you lead me to the one that did this to you?” 
 
The specialist flitted awkwardly from tree to tree, always staying within the range of my flashlight. I didn't know how much longer we had, so I did my best to hurry while navigating through puddles and detrius with the help of my cursed guide. 

That was when I began to hear a scraping sound. Digging? It got louder as I drew nearer. 

My light illuminated the mechanic, using a shovel to carve a deep hole into the earth right next to where the three sections of the Wood Maiden’s body lay. His banjo was propped up against a tree, close enough that he could reach it in seconds if someone made a move on it.

“You left quite a mess,” He commented as he stabbed the ground with the shovel. “Were you intendin’ on cleanin’ it up, or were you just waitin' on the buzzards to do it for ya?”

“My beloved needed help.” I replied bluntly. “That took precedence.”

He ignored me, “You know, buryin’ a Wood Maiden will give ‘em a second life. It takes some time, seein’ as they're trees and all. It's how they make more of ‘em. One life goes, another begins.”

Why was he telling me this? He never expressed any concern about her at any point prior to this. If anything, he'd seemed apathetic. Not to mention that Hunters are famously known to prey on Wood Maidens.

I dared to ask him, “Why do you care?”

He paused in his digging to give me a scathing look, made even more threatening by the low light. 

“I recall you sayin’ one time that you hate the way our kind was treated. You still stand by that?” His voice was low, challenging. 

Honestly, I replied, “I do.”

“Now's your chance to prove it.” 

“I want to, but-” At that he let out an aggravated sigh and shook his head. Keeping my voice gentle, I urged him, “Will you please listen?”

Iolo still looked strange. A cold mix of anger and something else, though I couldn't put my finger on what that was. But he didn't argue further, silently staring holes through me. 

“I'll do it,” I told him. “If you agree to turn the ELKS pest control specialists back into who they really are. Tonight.”

For a moment, I didn't think he would go for it. Why would he?

I continued, hearing my voice break a little bit as the guilt crept back in, “I meant what I said about wanting things to get better. This is *not* how I wanted any of this to go. I really do want to help her. Not just so that you'll release them, but to give her a chance at *something* after all of this.”

The mechanic’s glower didn't lighten any as he thrusted the shovel into the ground, saying, “Fine. Best get into it.”

He then turned to grab his banjo by the neck. While I continued what he'd started, widening the grave enough that the Wood Maiden's remains would fit, he played in the background. After a while, I heard the sickening crackle of bones, the meaty sound of flesh tearing, and squeaks that slowly morphed into agonized shouts. With a gasp, I dropped the shovel, turning on Iolo.

“I held up my end,” He informed me coldly. “Time for you to hold up yours.”

“Are they-”

He cut me off impatiently, “They're fine. You know the change ain't no fuckin’ picnic, Fiona. They came here meddlin’ in shit they had no business involvin' themselves in. I'm lettin’ ‘em off easy by givin’ the chance to run on back to where they came from. I could always change my mind.”

Without uttering another syllable, I returned to my task.

In death, the Wood Maiden's eyes were dim. Empty. Her face was frozen in an open-mouthed expression of terror. With a swallow, I aligned the sections of her body where they belonged in her makeshift resting place, then began covering her with a blanket of dirt. Worms welcomed her into their domain, inching across her skin.

By the time I was done, my shoulders and arms were sore. Iolo hadn't moved from where he oversaw my progress. 

Even though I should know better than to let my curiosity get the better of me, I tried questioning him again, simply because this request had been entirely out of left field for him, “I thought you didn't care about the Wood Maidens.”

“I don't.” He answered, confusing me further. 

“Then why…?”

Eyes hard, he shut me down. “You don't need to know everything. We both got what we wanted, now let's leave it at that.”

*Okay.* 

Without bothering to say anything else, I departed to leave him to his moodswing. Finding the way out was easier said than done. Yinz ever walk in unfamiliar woods at night? Dangerous business. It all begins to look the same after a while. Coyotes yipped in the darkness, but thankfully, they sounded far off. A good rule of thumb in situations like that is to walk in a straight line so that you don't find yourself going in circles. Presumably, you'll get somewhere eventually. 

The rumble of an idle engine told me I was getting close. Headlights flickered on. The ELKS had made it back to their van as unscathed as they could be after what the mechanic put them through, though all of them looked sickly and haunted. 

The driver, the same guy with the Mountains accent, simply told me, “Thank you.”

Not knowing what else to day, but, being all too familiar with what they'd experienced, I admitted, “I still have nightmares about the time that Huntsman turned me into a dog.”

After a pause, the guy offered a wry smile, “Were you at least a cool dog?”

“Yeah. A pitbull.” I said with a small laugh. “Yinz were some snazzy looking little birds.”

After some more back and forth between all of them, I wished the ELKS safe travels. In turn, they bade Orion good luck on whatever shitshow awaits us [next.](https://www.reddit.com/r/atypicalpests/s/SO6b77lmMD)

I'm looking for a partner in crime to share adventures with, both IRL and online. Bonus points if you want to rob a bank with me, fly to Bahamas, and 420 together on a tropical hotel beach resort. It'll be a blast!

Some info about me: I'm 34 yrs old and from Sweden, but ethnically Russo-Bengal. I'm 176 cm in height, black hair (tbh more like salt n' peppery), and kind brown eyes. On the heavier side because life really messed me up for a while, but I've lost a little bit and am working on myself both physically and mentally. That said I also have a lot of empathy for your own life struggles. Neurodivergent (very likely autistic, currently waiting for an evaluation), left leaning politically, a mix between a classic and modern man. A humanist and a romantic.

I'm looking to settle down with someone, I've always worn my heart on my sleeve - gone above and beyond for everyone I've ever cared for, so it'd be nice to have some reciprocity. I'm an introvert and a homebody but don't mind going out once in a while, whether it be for something grander or just a cozy coffee together. I get along best with clingy nerdy introverts, and if you're kind and into cute things I'm sure that'll help melt my heart =)

Some of my interests are:

- PC Gaming (WoW Anniversary/Classic/Retail, Overwatch 2, Risk of Rain 2, Civilization 6, Minecraft, Baldur's Gate 3, and plenty more. Let's find the next cool adventure together)

- Music (Daft Punk, Armin van Buuren, The Cure, Suicideboys, Kendrick Lamar, Pixies, Disarmonia Mundi, Modest Mouse, Provoker, and like a billion more)

- TV Shows (Mr. Robot, Battlestar Galactica, Mad Men, The Expanse, Venture Bros., Generation Kill, etc.)

- Movies (too many to list - where would I even start?)

- Anime (Code Geass, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, No Game No Life, Darker than Black, etc. etc. etc.)

- Shopping (anything nice really)

- Traveling (The Caribbean, Japan, Canary Isles, anywhere nice really, let's go somewhere together)

- Coding (Currently switching from a niche field to back-end, but I've always wanted to make a game with someone)


There's more to me than that, but perhaps we can save the rest for conversation. DMs open, so tell me a little bit about yourself and let's go from there. I prefer moving to a different app (guess which one is ideal for streaming movies and gaming?) if we hit it off. Cheers and have a nice day/evening!",1,1741297923.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I feel SoOoOoOooOoOoO incredibly relieved and wanted to make a post for people having catastrophic thoughts because I don’t see many posts regarding that. 

I had thoughts that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong because when you’re under you have zero control and can’t do anything to help yourself. I have mild iron deficiency anemia and mild thalassemia and I have some teeth/TMJ issues as well and was scared something was 100% going to go wrong, like waking up without a tooth, in lockjaw, or just not waking up ever again. I even made a joke as I was walking to the OR that I have to live to see Wicked: For Good, lolololol

Once I was on the table and they gave me the IV, the last thing I remember was saying “Oh shit🤪!” The next thing I knew I was waking up in recovery. The nurse had to kick my bed a little since I was so tired this morning, I kept *rolling over* and trying to go back to sleep since I didn’t take my Vyvanse today and had a pounding headache when I woke up this morning, probably because I didn’t take my Vyvanse or have coffee and was STRESSING.

The moment I woke up they gave me hot chocolate and the best cinnamon raisin toast I’ve ever had!! My throat feels a little sore from being intubated so I stopped and got an iced coffee on my way home and the moment I got in the car, I popped GasX! I have gas pains in my diaphragm and slightly in my shoulders. I might update tomorrow if I remember 

All this to say, you got this, I promise!!!!! Word vomit anything and everything that is giving you anxiety to your team—don’t hold back at all. Whatever you might feel ashamed of like me with my TMJ and teeth issues, and anything that you think they should know, let them know your life story if it’ll help you relax! And remember, you can choose to leave and not go through with it if you so decide. Go at your own pace, my babes!!

Good luck everyone! I believe in you💋💗",15,1741297843.0,sterilization,1,1.0,False

A lot of people were really helpful offering advice and recommendations and hoping that the update can pay it forward a little bit and help someone else in planning their trip or looking for local suggestions.
https://reddit.com/r/NashvilleGoodEats/comments/1iots55/critique_my_itinerary_and_need_nice_dinner_rec/
Also posted a more expansive trip report to r/VisitingNashville

Here's what I ended up eating:
Friday
- 6th & Peabody - Yee Haw Brewing & White Duck Taco - Cool vibe on a nice day. Beer was ok, tacos were solid. Tried them when visited Asheville and say they were on par with ones I got there. 
- Martin’s BBQ - Got 4 Ribs and Potato Salad. Good, but not great. Solid Preshow meal. 

Saturday 
- Parlor Donut & Latte - Almost completely sold out of donuts, besides two random Maple Bacon donuts. Got one and it was really good, plus a surprisingly really good vanilla latte. 
- Red’s Hot Chicken @ Springwater - Asked at window for a rec between sandwich or Crunchwrap and guy working recommended Crunchwrap. Wish I had gone with a sandwich in hindsight as chicken was chopped pretty finely and got lost in the mix. Ordered it medium spice and it really enjoyed it, 
- Culture & Co., Honest Coffee & 5 Daughters at L&L Market - really loved the concept of Culture & Co and had some nice pairings. Spoke with really nice owners and had a great experience, but agree with most critiques I've read of it being too expensive. Great cortado at Honest Coffee and took a couple mini donuts to go from 5 Daughters. Surprisingly preferred Parlor Donut vs. 5 Daughters as these were pretty dry.
- Joyland Crustburger for late night - Got burger togo, but took a bite while it was fresh. Can honestly say it was one of the best burgers I've ever had, even cold and all congealed. 

Sunday
- Cortado @ Whisk Creperie in Assembly Hall - Inedible, horrible coffee. Took two sips and tossed.
- “Sumo Mary” @ Sunda - Everything was really good, but had a weird service issue that soured experience. Sumo Mary as advertised is served as 32oz. Didn't want to drink that much so served offered to make a smaller 16oz version and have food served on plate rather than skewered ontop. Bill came and they charged same price, even though I got smaller drink and they said the price was the price, no matter what size drink I got.  
- Barista Parlor @ W hotel - Great latte! Took it to The Restaurant in the hotel and listened to some really good music. Really liked the seating variety and vibe of BP's space. Definitely hotel lounge-vibes, but very cool space. 


Monday:
- Breakfast at Monell’s - One of the highlights of trip! Such a unique experience. Really feel like the world would be a better place if there were more places like this! Tried to pull a fast one and utilize the ole buffet trick of arriving close to the changeover between breakfast/lunch to take advantage of both, but they only allowed me to experience their breakfast food. Luckily breakfast still included their amazing fried chicken, biscuits and plenty of amazing sides. Left very full and happy!
- Walk through Little Hats - Walked around Germantown and walked through Little Hats Deli. Really cool spot, wish I had a second stomach as I would have loved to eat here too, but I was just so full from Monell's. 
- Goo Goo Clusters - Definitely a tourist trap, but was fun to build my own candy bar and see it made. Tasted just okay and it was expensive for what it was, but don't regret visiting. 
- Recession Special @ Robert’s Western World - Another highlight of the trip! Bologna sandwich was surprisingly good and music/ambiance was great. Nice departure from all the celebrity owned honky tonks and cover bands!
- Dinner @ Husk - Ate in bar, not the nicest spot in the restaurant but food was great! Got Beef Tartare, Pig Ear Lettuce Wraps and a coffee granita dessert that were all really good!

Tuesday 
- Latte @ Crema - Really good latte. A bit overhyped IMHO. Felt lattes from Parlor Donuts and Barista Parlor were better. 
- Pulled Pork Taco & Red Headed Stranger - ended up having a few extra hours to kill before my flight out and decided to check out another neighborhood and RHS came highly recommended. Got out of my Uber and was surprised to find Audrey right next door. I had really wanted to go to Audrey the night before, but ended up going to Husk because it's proximity to the Listening Room. Audrey wasn't open yet, so got Pulled Pork Taco and a Hibiscus Aqua Fresca and was really impressed. Wish I had that second stomach again... 
- Lunch @ Audrey - Great meal. Got Johnny Cakes with Pimento and Aged Country Ham. Food was great. Loved the vibe of the restaurant. Got a tour of the upstairs testing kitchen and cookbook library and thought that was really cool! 
- Prince’s @ Airport - Flight got delayed, so got to eat here. Got Mild tenders, not to overly spice before my flight and really loved my meal. Perfect, juicy tenders... still plenty of heat with the mild. Wish I had tenders at Reds to compare directly, but think Prince's would be hard to beat. 

Was solo for the majority of the trip, so was able to cover a lot of ground. Saw everything I really wanted to see but am definitely hoping to return for another trip to Nashville to explore more restaurants/breweries and neighborhoods. 

Thanks again to everyone for all their help in building my itinerary.",4,1741297532.0,NashvilleGoodEats,0,0.83,False
1j56wzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1j56wzw/i_dont_think_my_wife_loves_me_anymore/,I don't think my wife loves me anymore,"So back story we have been married for 10 years, together for 15 years and have a 8 year old son and 6 year old daughter.  Right now I feel like a roommate with my wife and she enjoyed the time travel for work more than when I am home.

We have been married for 10 years and they have had ups and downs, and I feel like we have had a good relationship with very little problems.  We have run into the occasional tight month with money that causes a fight is about the worst of it.  

One of the problems is we haven't had sex in almost a year, I try to initiate and she just sighs so then I stop since it is obvious that she doesn't want to.  When I asked her about 3 months ago about it she said it is the only time I am intimate with her is when I want sex.  So I made the conscious effort to change that I started kissing her for longer in the morning when she left for work (I work from home) and when she came home I would give her a hug and kiss also.  I will say I did this before but she said it was passionate enough.  She also said I don't cuddle in bed and I will own up to it I usually didn't just wasn't who I was but again I tried to change it and do it more if we go to bed at the same time I usually go to bed about an hour earlier than her do to my work hours require me to start at 6am in the morning.  But nothing has changed in the sex department she still sighs and stops it I can get by with no sex but what she did last week broke my heart.

I was away for a week and she was home with the kids and I would facetime every evening to talk with the kids and her their day.  I started to notice she would hand me off to the kids the moment she could and avoid talking to me, I would say I miss you guys she wouldn't say it back.  She would just say how easy the week was going with me gone.  Don't get me wrong I am glad it was easy for her with the kids activities and getting supper and everything ready during the evenings (most of the time I do all the cooking and half the activities).  On Friday she was supposed to go supervise a tournament at her school she is a teacher it ended up being cancelled but I had already arranged for the kids to have a sleepover so she was going to be by herself.  Texted her ""On the plane see you soon love you""  and all I got was ""Okay"", when I landed texted her ""Landed safe see you in about an hour""  got nothing in return it was 8pm.  Got home around 9pm and she was already upstairs in bed sleeping.  The next morning I asked her what time she went to bed and she said I saw you landed and decided to go to sleep no text no call nothing it really made me feel unloved.  After thinking about it the next couple of days I realized I plan every monthly date night, I bring her coffee and flower at least once a month.  I even got a separate work phone  so I don't constantly look at my phone when an email comes in as I put it away after my work hours.  

Sorry for the long post I am just not were to go from here, tried acting on her requests but nothing seems to change.",2,1741297198.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False

When they didn't show up he couldn't go to work. It was a financial strain.

I took over as caregiver (it took months for everything to be finalized). And it was fine because my stepdad was also there. But then my stepdad was suddenly gone (not dead, just no longer here. A whole different story). And it was just me. 

I had to take care of my mom alone. My mom became very needy. I was taking care of her, cleaning while she napped, any time I sat down to breathe she called me. She wanted me to sit next to her at all times but I can only watch what she was watching. And with her being blind it has to be audio description or I have to explain everything that was happening. I stopped enjoying watching anything. Bills had to be paid, grocery shopping had to be done, dog needed to be walked, meals had to be made. I lost a lot of weight because I didn't eat. I was exhausted because I couldn't sleep through the night because she had to sit on the cammode. Her blood sugar was really high, then it was really low. 

I am at a point that I cringe when I hear my name being called. I'm actually thinking about changing it so I never have to hear it again. 

So I decided some things had to stop. I am a caregiver, not a slave. 

A change in diet got her blood pressure under control (my stepdad fed her garbage). I was on a low salt diet myself so it was easy for me to cook for her. Her sugar was going from being high to dropping low. More diet changes and we seem to have it constantly at a healthy level (no more alerts in the middle of the night). This has also affected her bowel movements. We don't have to get up in the middle of the night to get her out of bed, or clean anything up. 

I wake up in the morning and get myself ready for the day. I drink a protein shake, I prepare my coffee and turn on the water kettle for her tea. Then I take the dog out. *Then* I go to her room. Change her diaper, get her out of bed, and make her breakfast. When she is eating I make mine and drink my coffee. Then she goes to the bathroom then goes back to bed. 

Four days a week we do dialysis (went through six weeks of training to do this at home). Doing it at home is more of a burden because I don't get a break from her like I did before, but she is healthier now. She constantly missed treatments because the transportation didn't show up or got here so late she just refused to go. So she ended up in the hospital more often. And I don't get paid when she is in the hospital. After dialysis she sleeps. So I get time to myself.

And I put her to bed around 8. I take care of what needs to be taken care of and try to watch TV. She wanted to go to bed when I was ready for bed. But it takes *so long* to get her ready for bed (she's needy now, so at least an hour of her asking for things and complaining about something). So me wanting to go to sleep and not being able to for a whole extra hour (at least) was making me extremely irritable. So she has a set bed time now. 

I stopped cleaning everything. I said something needs to be neglected so I can take care of myself. Can't neglect my mom, can't neglect the pets, and had to stop neglecting myself. I was sweeping every day, mopping every other day. General cleaning, but having pets means things need to be cleaned *daily*. Downsizing pets helped a lot. Trying to keep the house spotless was making me crazy because there just wasn't enough time in the day to do it all. 

Now I just make sure the dishes are cleaned and sweep once a week. Swiffer mop as needed for spot cleanings and fully mop everything when needed. Laundry isn't so bad now that there's less people here. 

I still feel overwhelmed and want to run away, but realizing it is okay to neglect some things has helped me to try to find some time for myself. For the time being I won't have a spotless house. But it's worth it to be able to have ""me"" time. Even if me time is one episode of some random show and a shower. ",9,1741297105.0,CaregiverSupport,1,1.0,False

I would put myself in the intermediate category of woodworking and finishing I make furniture and cabinets, have dabbled in epoxy etc. I was going to use Osmo Poly-X as it’s one of my favorite finishes but a friend of mine suggested a thin coat of system-three rot fix before applying the Osmo to harden the surface due to the extremely soft nature of redwood. Hence why it’s 3 years old and already getting refinished. Anyone have any recommendations or suggestions for hardening wood in this manor?

My expectations were clearly too high but overall I guess my questions are: What is the absolute best superautomatic machine that money can buy, and can that machine get to coffee shop level coffee? 

And second, could anyone who knows explain to me why it is that superautomatics cannot match manual machines? Will there ever be a time when I can buy a super auto machine that churns out super high quality coffee?

1j56stb,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1j56stb/struggling_to_lose_fat_fasting_training_but_no/,"Struggling to Lose Fat – Fasting, Training, But No Progress","Hey everyone, I could really use some advice.

So, I’ve been doing 16/8 intermittent fasting for the past 5 days, but my weight hasn’t budged at all. Usually, when you start a diet, you drop at least some water weight at the beginning, but for me—nothing (actually I gained 1kg). I don’t get it. I’m starting to wonder if it’s my age (25) or if my lack of sleep (4-6 hours a night) is messing with my progress.

Quick Background:

I’ve always struggled with body composition. I was a skinny fat kid—at 16, I was 85kg (187 lbs), mostly belly fat. I started hitting the gym at 16, lost some fat, and by 18, I dropped to 73kg (161 lbs) while putting on some muscle. Even then, I never had a visible six-pack, which made no sense to me.

Since then, my weight has bounced around: 85 → 90 → 95 → back to 85 → back to 95, and at one point (23 years old), I hit 105kg (231 lbs) and just looked fat. I don’t have the genetics to pull off that “big gym guy” look. My collarbones are narrow, my limbs are long, my waist is average, and my chest insertions are terrible, so I just look soft when I gain weight. The only muscles that are naturally big are my traps and glutes (which isn’t exactly the aesthetic I want lol).

Btw I'm 186cm (6'1'').

4 months ago, I was 91kg (200 lbs), now I’m 97kg (214 lbs).

Current Training & Diet:

Gym: 4-5x a week (haven’t skipped in 1.5 years except for traveling)

Basketball: 1-2x a week

Steps: 8-10k daily

Cardio: 30 min incline treadmill walking (5km/h, 15°) after lifting (past 2 weeks)

Fasting: 16/8 for 5 days, no weight loss so far

Sleep: Usually 4-6 hours a night, which might be screwing me over


My Food Situation:

I have celiac disease, so my diet is super limited—no fast food, no random snacks, no processed junk. Honestly, food doesn’t mean much to me anymore. Back in high school, when my friends would go to McDonald’s, I could only eat fries and a salad, so over time, I just stopped caring about food. I don’t eat for taste, I eat because I have to.

Last 5 days:

First meal (10 AM): 30g soy protein + small banana

11 AM: 4 soft-boiled eggs

2 PM Lunch: ~300g chicken breast/salmon + ~200g frozen veggies (air fryer, no oil)

6 PM Dinner: 500g skyr + frozen fruits

Drinks: 4L water, 1-3 black coffees (tiny bit of milk, no sugar)

Supplements: Creatine (started again 2 weeks ago), multivitamin, magnesium, collagen, omega-3, ashwagandha, melatonin, caffeine pills instead of energy drinks


My Problem:

I don’t count calories, but I know I’m eating less than before. I should be losing SOMETHING by now, even if just water weight. Could it be the creatine (2 weeks in) holding extra water? Or is it my sleep (4-6 hours a night) making fat loss impossible?

Also, one weird thing I’ve noticed since starting fasting—my toilet situation is a mess. Even though I eat really clean, I’ve been going to the bathroom way more than before, no idea why.

I’ve never felt confident about my body, and I really want to get lean this time. Just trying to figure out why my body refuses to drop weight despite eating clean, fasting, and training hard.

1j56pf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1j56pf5/elevate_your_wellness_routine_simple_habits_for_a/,Elevate Your Wellness Routine: Simple Habits for a Happier You,"In today’s fast-paced world, it's easy to lose track of our well-being amidst the chaos. However, taking small steps toward a more intentional and healthy lifestyle can make a world of difference. By incorporating simple habits into your daily routine, you can elevate your wellness and embrace a happier, more balanced life. Here are a few easy-to-follow tips that will help you cultivate a better sense of well-being.

**1. Start Your Day with a Morning Routine**

How you start your day sets the tone for the rest of it. Begin by waking up a bit earlier than usual and taking time for yourself. This doesn’t mean you need an hour-long ritual, but a few moments of stillness can work wonders. Whether it’s practicing deep breathing, stretching, or enjoying a cup of tea in silence, the key is to create a calm and focused start to your day.

**2. Move Your Body Daily**

Exercise is one of the most effective ways to improve both your physical and mental health. You don’t need to run a marathon to experience the benefits—daily movement, even something as simple as a brisk walk, can do wonders for your energy levels and mood. Find an activity you enjoy, be it yoga, dancing, or going for a jog, and aim to incorporate it into your routine. Your body will thank you, and your mind will feel clearer and more grounded.

**3. Prioritize Nutritious Eating**

What you put into your body directly impacts how you feel. While indulging occasionally is fine, aim to nourish your body with whole, unprocessed foods. Eating a balanced diet full of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains helps fuel both your body and mind. When you eat right, you’ll notice more energy, better sleep, and a generally happier mood.

**4. Practice Gratitude**

In the hustle of daily life, it’s easy to focus on what’s going wrong rather than what’s going right. Try starting or ending your day by listing a few things you’re grateful for. Whether it’s your health, your family, or something as simple as a warm cup of coffee, shifting your mindset to one of gratitude can boost your happiness and help you stay grounded in the present.

**5. Disconnect to Reconnect**

In an era where we’re constantly connected, taking breaks from technology is essential for maintaining good mental health. Dedicate certain hours of your day to disconnecting from screens—put your phone down, step away from the computer, and enjoy time doing something more fulfilling. Whether it's reading a book, enjoying a hobby, or spending quality time with loved ones, unplugging helps reduce stress and recharges your mental energy.

**6. Get Enough Sleep**

Sleep is the foundation of good health, yet many of us overlook its importance. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night to allow your body and mind to fully recharge. A consistent sleep schedule can help improve your mood, concentration, and overall health. Create a relaxing bedtime routine—like reading or meditating—to signal to your body that it’s time to wind down and get the rest it needs.

**7. Surround Yourself with Positive Influences**

The people you interact with and the environment you inhabit play a significant role in your overall wellness. Surround yourself with individuals who uplift you, support your goals, and bring positivity into your life. Create a peaceful and inspiring environment at home and at work. When your space is filled with positive energy, it’s easier to feel happier and more focused on your wellness.

Incorporating these simple habits into your daily routine can have a profound impact on your overall health and happiness. Remember that wellness is a journey, not a destination. It’s about making small, consistent changes that align with your values and well-being. By prioritizing your physical and mental health every day, you’ll create a more fulfilling and joyful life for yourself.

So, start today—your future self will thank you for it!",1,1741296656.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False
1j56p2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1j56p2v/i_lost_my_first_girlfriend/,I lost my first girlfriend,"I (m23) was dumped by my (now ex) gf (f19) last night and I’m feeling so empty.

The relationship wasn’t long at all. We met at the start of the new year and it felt like she was meant to be. I never was able to trust people very easy and had planned on taking that approach with her.

She stole my heart. Made me feel like a million dollars. Told me she saw a future with me. We were official for a little over a month before last night. 

Just this last Sunday, she eagerly came to a movie and breakfast with myself and my mother. We made plans to hang out and watch a couple movies on Wednesday. Everything seemed normal. 

I did notice she had gotten a little distant, but she is a student and I know I can be distant for a couple days too. I didn’t think much of it. 

I show up to her house yesterday and was greeted by her and her dog, gave her a hug and went into the bathroom to change out of my work clothes. 

I came back out and she was sitting on the couch, looking like someone just told her that a close family member died. I asked her what’s wrong and she said “we need to have a talk..about us.”

I told her to let me know what was on her mind. Speaking up was never her forte and honestly I was kind of excited to hear her voice her opinion. 

She told me that she thinks we jumped into a relationship too fast and she didn’t give herself time to see who I was as a person. She continuously said that I’m an amazing person, she just thought we were too different to be in a long term relationship. 

After a bit more of a conversation, I realized there was no salvaging this. She made her decision. She had no interest in being my girlfriend. She couldn’t get a spark, she didn’t feel a connection. 

I wished her well, put on my shoes and left. 

This fucking ate at me. We had been fine for weeks. I liked her a lot. I ended up feeling a need to text and ask her…I basically got the same thing with some more details.

I wanted to know what all of the sudden made her not see me as an ideal partner.

She didn’t like that I smoked weed. Something I asked about at our first date. We were sitting in a coffee shop and I directly said “how do you feel about weed?” She told me that she had never tried it but doesn’t have an issue with it. A couple more times in the next few weeks I asked her if it made her uncomfortable. She said absolutely not. Well, come to find out it was something she was trying to force herself to get over, but she couldn’t. 

She didn’t like that I lacked Christian beliefs. Again, something I asked about on our first date. “Your profile said agnostic, can I ask about that a little more?” She said she had spiritual beliefs but wasn’t religious. Her mother was raised catholic but it was never pushed on them. 

I wasn’t raised religious and do not have strong beliefs. I have morals of course but I don’t follow a book. She didn’t like that I would make jokes about religions. 

She was everything I thought I wanted in a partner until she broke it off with me. She consistently lied to me. We even had conversations about how we feel about things and she never had anything but positives. I’m so hurt. Not because she’s gone, it was only 2 months. But because I feel like I was a victim of deceit. She expressed her self to me several times and I only pushed into the relationship as a way to reciprocate. Only to find out she didn’t have a connection to me. ",1,1741296633.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1j56p1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1j56p1d/dentists_please_help_me/,"Dentists, please help me!","Forgive me as this might be long. As a kid, I wasn’t taught proper dental hygiene and pretty much only brushed 1-2 times a day and rarely flossed. My parents had negative experiences with the dentists, and taught my siblings and I that dentistry is a scam. By the time I was 18, I had fillings on pretty much most of my posterior teeth. 

When I turned 21, I went in for my annual exam and was told I have severe gingivitis and that over 11 cavities (all were interproximal), some were recurrent decay under my old fillings. I knew I had to make a change. From that moment on, I made sure to brush 2-3 times a day, floss 2x a day and I’m even using prevident 5000 toothpaste. I’ve changed my diet where I no longer consume soda, sticky candy or energy drinks. I primarily drink milk, water and on occasion I’ll have a coffee (I’ll dilute it with water after). My diet has completely changed, and I’m struggling to find the balance as I’ve become afraid of eating anything sweet. It’s taken a huge toll on my mental health. I’ve lost 13lbs, my nails are chipping and I’ve even experienced hair loss as I’m so afraid of eating anything that’s deemed as “unhealthy.”

Here’s the problem:
I went to the dentist 9 times in the span of two months between (Jan 8- February 22) to fill all of my cavities, and unfortunately tooth 18, 4 and 5 were quite deep. They told me I wouldn’t need a root canal, but I would need a crown since I have bruxism. The dental work was extensive, ngl. I’ve now been suffering with nerve pain, and dull tooth aches around those areas. It’s spontaneous, and it comes and goes. I don’t have sensitivity to cold or hot, and it’s not keeping me up at night. But it is noticeable, and it’s been over 3 weeks to no help. I’ve been taking ibuprofen to calm the inflammation, 
and it works on and off. 

I went to the endodontist to see if I needed a root canal on these teeth, and she did multiple exams on them. We even did a cold vitality test and she said I’m responding within normal reaction, and measured my gums (no more gingivitis!) and no bleeding/irritation. She told me I don’t need a root canal, and sometimes fillings, especially deep fillings can have lasting nerve pain for months. 

I’m really struggling. I’m doing the work to keep my oral health in check, but these dull aches have me wondering if I should just do the root canals and get it over with.

I appreciate all the help I can get.",2,1741296631.0,askdentists,3,1.0,False

1j56nt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blockmandev/comments/1j56nt7/safes_internal_investigation_reveals_developers/,🚨 Safe’s internal investigation reveals developer’s laptop breach led to Bybit hack,"When the digital realm meets a developer's coffee break, sometimes chaos reigns. Safe has uncovered that the massive Bybit hack was cooked up from a compromised laptop of one of its own developers. Picture this: a funky Docker project crossed paths with a shady website, and voila, our developer fell for the oldest trick in the book.

Hacker magic happened when multi-factor authentication was deftly sidestepped. Those crafty perpetrators exploited active Amazon Web Services tokens, allowing them to sneak into Bybit's safe haven and alter the destiny of around $1.5 billion worth of ETH. That is not just a hack – it's a financial thriller!

The breach, traced back to a MacBook belonging to “Developer1,” gives new meaning to the phrase “keeping your friends close and your malware closer.” With an arsenal of tools like Kali Linux under their belt, our hackers orchestrated a symphony of chaos, even mingling on Telegram to bait the unsuspecting developer.

In response to this digital disaster, Safe has huddled together to overhaul its security playbook, locking down access and making sure that only a select few wield the developer wand. They are monitoring the skies for any threats, conducting audits, and keeping a watchlist for malicious activities.

As the crypto whirls, learn from this tale and keep a keen eye on your digital assets. The future of finance is as thrilling as it is unpredictable, and staying informed is your best defense against the wild side of the blockchain universe.

I can’t tell you all what a tremendous resource it is for planning out a trip and discovering some things about the town we wouldn’t have known otherwise. The weekend we had here was unforgettable and we can’t thank you all enough for the time you put into this sub and for being such great ambassadors for the city. New Orleans without a doubt has her hooks in us now. We will see you all again, hopefully soon

The cliff’s notes on our itinerary for those interested/also planning a visit:

Friday: landed around 2, stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel (y’all, do not sleep on the beignets at the Roosevelt, amazing), straight to dinner at Willie Mae’s (every bit as good as I remember), and lucked into a really good spot between Julia and St Joseph for Hermes/d’Etat/Morpheus

Saturday: found a great spot near the Circle K at Tivoli Circle with some friendly locals for Iris/Tucks (so fun!). Debated watching Endymion closer to the hotel on Canal or hanging out by a brewery on Girod and made the judgment error of staying by Canal…didn’t love the chaos level over there, didn’t stay for too long, went for a late dinner at Juan’s Flying Burrito (excellent)

Sunday: wife booked us all day for Lula Gras at Lula Distillery on St. Charles, one of the most fun experiences of the weekend, the energy was amazing, the snacky bites and king cake provided by the restaurant were great, (shoutout to Tink and Diamond for taking great care of us all) Okeanos/Mid-City/Thoth were all really fun, we happened to be in the correct spot for the box wine parade(!!!!!!), and really enjoyed Bacchus and Shaq. Stopped by Bourbon after for a nightcap at the Bourbon St. Drinkery, fun stop for my fellow craft beer drinkers. 

Monday: Lundi Gras jazz brunch at commander’s, a top ten meal of my lifetime maybe, followed by a stopover at Cafe Beignet on Royal for a quick coffee/dessert (tasty bites, neat space). This was the one night we opted for grandstand seats across from city hall for Proteus/Orpheus/Cybertruck-gate. Neither of us loved the grandstands, stuck in one spot, not a lot of room to roam, not much in the way of food choices, still neat to see the krewe leaders exchange pleasantries with the mayor

FAT TUESDAY: Up bright and early and found a fun spot with mostly nice folks on Poydras near Baronne for Zulu (missed Rex as weather concerns pushed it to a different location), amazing parade. Ubered over to Parasol’s for drinks and po’ boys (great energy there), strolled over to the bulldog uptown for happy hour, (great craft beer selection, kind folks), back to the hotel for a snooze, downstairs to Domenica for dinner and finished the night at the Erin Rose and caught the blue parade after, pretty neat

Wednesday: stopped by the Sazerac house, amazingly well done, walked over to Cochon butcher for an outstanding lunch before heading home ",14,1741296360.0,AskNOLA,1,1.0,False
1j56jkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1j56jkm/aitah_for_thinking_my_friend_said_an_antisemitic/,AITAH for thinking my friend said an antisemitic comment?,"So this all happened a few days ago, and I really just want to know if I’m in the wrong here. Me and my friend, Connor, often fight about religious beleifs.  He is a very-christian-guy and feels very strongly about it, and I am an athiest, which causes a few fights and rifts in our relationship. He has made a few offhanded comments in the past about political and religious beliefs that I do not align with, but I normally don’t call him out on it. 

Anyway, this all happened late at night on Sunday. We were with another friend at my place, just having a chill night and talking about life. At some point, I just put in my airpods because Connor and my other friend were conversing between themselves and it didn’t relate to me. Once I looked up, maybe 10 minutes later, Connor and my other friend were having a huge fight about religion and politics. It is important to note that my other friend is also an athiest. My friend ended up storming out of my house and driving away after their screaming match with Connor, leaving me alone with him. 

He was still going off at this point, at me this time, even though my friend, who he started the argument with, left. At that point, it was still a screaming match, but now between me and him. Conner only stayed for a few minutes before his girlfriend called to tell him to come home, but within that time, he tried to play the victim card saying something about how Christianity is being hated on too much for “no good reason”. While tt’s all a little bit fuzzy because I have a bad memory and I get flustered when I get into arguments when I have to think on the spot, I recall him saying an antisemetic comment that I am not going to repeat on this app, then storming off and leaving since his girlfriend called. 

In the morning when I saw Connor again, since we are both interning at the same place, I called him out for saying the antisemetic comment. He denied ever saying that, but I went over to talk to my boss about an unrelated question before Connor could defend himself. I texted him later in the day, basically appoligising for the way I handled it and saying I never want to talk about religion with him again, and I would immediately walk away if it happened. Later, he asked me to meet for lunch at a local coffee shop to talk it out. 

At the coffee shop, he said he has a bunch of Jewish friends and would never say something of that sort. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and appoligised to him, but he said he no longer wanted to be friends with me because I thought that he said an antisemetic comment and that I was “capable” of thinking he would say something like that. It’s gonna be weird at work now, but I don’t think he thought that far ahead, to be honest.

I am looking for recommendations for where to stay that would be budget friendly and lower crowds. Traveling with a child, our goals are pretty simple: easy but beautiful hiking trails near by, a few restaurants, a coffee shop, groceries, maybe a park.

We would be flying into Calgary and will have a rental car. Willing to take day trips from where we are staying up to around an hour drive.

I have absolutely zero must-do spots picked out, nor do we need to hit the biggest and best attractions in the area, so we'd be willing to have our home base anywhere in the general area. 

We love renting e bikes when we travel, so access to that would be a bonus. 

Prefer Airbnb or similar apartment/suite style rental options with kitchens.

For some fun, here are six used items that are way more sketch than buying a pre-owned bra:

* YOUR PRE-OWNED CAR — What’s been spilled where you sit to commute? How many times has the passenger seat seen vomit? And the backseat gets more concerning the roomier it is. A lot of life goes down in a car and yours was no exception.



* YOUR PRE-OWNED HOUSE — Unless you had your house built or that apartment sees you as the first tenant, your dwelling is used. The older it is, the more used it gets. Maybe someone died in it, or had the plague, or had a kink room they kept secret from their friends.



* THE SILVERWARE AND DISHES AT A RESTAURANT — How many mouths has that fork been in before it held your Caesar salad? What about that coffee mug? Or that napkin you just wiped your mouth with after eating off that plate that held dinner trash an hour ago?



* THE TOILET OUT SHOPPING — This speaks for itself. You can only hover for so long and that seat has seen some things. It’s not clean and you know it, but what choice is there? We’ve all sat on those things knowing exactly what we are sitting on.



* YOUR LAST HOTEL ROOM — Carpet, bathroom, towels, bedding and…everything has all been used and abused by who knows who doing who knows what (well, you do know). I won’t link to all the articles exposing hotels lack of proper sanitizing and cleaning.



* WATER — Water is what it is and it’s cycled through our entire world and everything in it. Sure, some is newly made, but the water you drank this morning passed through sewers, rivers, animals and your neighbors before it quenched your thirst.

We are clean-freaks at Billy’s, so every bra that doesn’t have tags is sanitized, washed and air-dried. While it’s waiting to find a new spot in your drawer, it’s stored sealed away so it stays clean. We take all the “ick” out of buying a pre-owned bra so you can afford your boobs.

Think I made it worse.","TL;DR - Found some issues at work, was told to basically ""stay in my lane"", while attempting to do so got called into the office where my raises and ""perks"" were now at risk.

Two small stories from the last few weeks that kind of led up to this situation today. Kind of long but just wanted to vent some place.

***If The Bolt Don't Fit...***

Two or three weeks back I happened to be out on the shop floor and noticed some seats being taken apart and rebuilt with new bolts - after some back and forth with the senior tech (of over 20 years) found out they'd been having issues with them for weeks now and they'd built over 100 sets to date. Long story short, one glance and I could tell the bolts and nuts had different thread pitches - went to test and sure enough, wrong combination. Now 100 seats are at the customer pending return for rework when the new bolts arrive. Thousands of dollars in hours reworking stuff and program delays for something the senior assembly technician should have caught on the second bolt when it wasn't hitting spec.

***Where Art Thou, Ecoat?***

Already catching attitude from at least three people for noticing the bolt issue, they were short handed in the weld area and asked if I could stay over and help out - program is already made, just need to load and unload the fixtures. Sure - easy money. Watched them load a few and took over, assumed they had already had the quality done as they'd been running these parts for at least two days. Took over and noticed it had a pretty gnarly spur and discussing it with one of the higher program guys that was reviewing the parts, he commented about how he was surprised these parts didn't have e-coat on the part of the handle that was not getting welded, as they usually do. I looked at the part and realized he was correct, told him I was going to go check the print to make sure it wasn't missed. 

Surprise! It was missed. Another work stop until we got direction from engineering, got approval to just make a template and use the spray paint version for this batch and we'd send the rest out for the actual coating. Again, delayed us about a day waiting for the response and more hours spent hand spraying these parts now and getting all the parts in the containers out to spray them.

Onto this week.

Monday morning I was in the weld area waiting for the manager to get out of a meeting to review something related to my actual job. I was watching two of the weld and quality techs looking at a fixture trying to decide what had to be adjusted based on the scan data and when they put one of the parts up there were to very obvious pins missing (there were brightly colored paint circles around where they should have been. As I was asking if they had to turn the pins down or make new ones, the manager happened to walk up and went to touch the pan but not before making the comment ""I don't think this concerns you"".

Just, lul. Worth mentioning he is probably the one that is getting beaten up for these other things being missed, so he probably was having a bad day but I was already being treated like a leper from at least 4 people now for finding stuff just ""by chance"", I didn't need to get it from him as well.

My main role is completely computer based, 90% of which is Excel so anything outside of that is me putting my own workload on hold to try to help out the team as a whole. Stewed a little on it that day and after talking to my partner realized it was pretty messed up that he said that, so stewed on it more Tuesday.

On Tuesday while kind of venting about it to the two guys in welding I learned that one of the them was actually on vacation after that day all the way until Wednesday of next week and he made a comment about how it was a poor time for the manager to tell me to basically ""stay in my lane"". Gave me a EUREKA! moment and decided to enact 'Malicious Compliance' mode and did not leave my desk at all on Wednesday, except for breaks and lunch.

At the end of the day I went to walk by to leave for the day and manager was sweating and looking like a mad man and flagged me down. He asked if I was able to stay late to help, told him I was not. He asked what I had going on tomorrow because they could probably use some help all day in the welding area, guess my face gave me away as I said I was trying to work on the project we just had a meeting about a few hours prior.

He stared at me for a second and said he would reach out to the person it was for to see if it could be postponed until next week. I left already kind of annoyed.

Today I decided not to rush to get into work (I usually got there at least 20 minutes early to finish my coffee and decompress on my phone) - walked in right at 7:00 from the doors closest to my desk and went right to work. Not even 5 minutes later I hear footsteps stomping around the hall and he looks in and sees me and says he needs to have a meeting with me, now.

Assumed he kind of figured it out, but guess the other guy must have blabbed about my malicious compliance because he opened it up with what my problem is and he has enough childish stuff to deal with that he doesn't need to ""lose sleep"" over anything else. Told him I was just trying to focus on my own work, as I am being treated like a leper out on the floor for finding issues when I was sent to help. He got annoyed and said to not worry about them and that is not my problem.

Informed him I was not in a big hurry to go help out in other areas if I'm just going to get disregarded as an asshole and mentioned how he even made the comment Monday.

He said he was already annoyed and when he turned to see me smiling asking someone where the pins were he got even more aggravated (didn't apologize, just cited the reason why he snapped). Told him I am not going to volunteer or try to help on my own, but if that is the direction he gives is for me to go and help on the floor I would do it. Told him I was fully committed to ""matching the energy and work ethic"" of the others on the floor, which he took VERY poorly.

Reiterated again that I would help on the floor if he came and assigned me there, but I was not going to stay and be witness to the time theft that happened every day as well (which in retrospect is probably going to make this situation even worse). That turned into a small back and forth that I wish I would have recorded because he basically condoned the letting them charge more time for ""working so hard"". Note: they do no work after 5:00PM, I know, I've stayed plenty of those times they say they worked those hours.

Meeting ended with me turning robotic in my replies to focus on my primary job and to send a request if he needs me to support other areas. Didn't say another word to me all day and neither did the rest of the guys on the floor so assuming he already gave them a heads up that I mentioned the hours thing.

In addition to providing a club for people to share their interest in thrifting & upcycling, it can also be an org to partner with for people who have their independent businesses.

My friends are already roasting me for it, so why not share the joy here?

So, last weekend, my boyfriend and I decided to have a *spontaneous* night. You know, like those couples you see in rom-coms where everything’s hot and heavy, and the night ends with fireworks? Yeah, I thought we could be one of those couples. *Big mistake.*

We were having a chill evening—Netflix, pizza, the usual—and out of nowhere, I got this crazy idea: *Why not spice things up?* I had this fantasy in my head where we’d get all steamy, the mood would be perfect, and I’d surprise him in the most seductive way possible. You know, like those scenes in the movies where the woman walks in, all confident and sexy, and the guy’s jaw drops? That was going to be me. Spoiler alert: it was not me.

I figured I'd make it *extra special,* so I thought, ""Let’s get some candles lit, put on some music, and get in the mood."" I had just learned how to do this dance on TikTok that I thought would be the *perfect* lead-in. You know, a little shimmy, a little twirl... I was going to get him *really* into it.

So, I’m in the living room, trying to get my moves down. Let me just say—I'm not a dancer. At all. But I thought if I added the ""sexy"" vibe and a little TikTok magic, he'd be *blown away.* Well, I started moving, and immediately, I knocked over a candle. No big deal, right? Just some wax. WRONG. The wax splattered onto the carpet, and in my panic, I slipped on the rug and fell straight onto the coffee table.

Now, imagine me—half-naked, sprawled on the floor, my hair all over the place, candles everywhere, and the sound of *Eye of the Tiger* blasting from the Bluetooth speaker (because I forgot to pause the playlist while I was setting up). It was *not* the seductive scene I had in mind. It was like an out-of-body experience where I was watching myself slowly destroy the vibe.

But here's the best part. Just as I’m laying there, trying to recover some dignity, I hear him in the hallway saying, ""Babe, are you okay?"" I try to stand up, but in my frantic attempt to look composed, I end up face-planting right into the rug.

He rushes over, concerned, and I’m like, “Yeah, I’m fine... just giving you a sneak peek of what’s to come.” (*Cringe, right?*) He chuckles nervously, unsure whether I’m joking or if I’m actually in pain.

But THEN, right when I think this whole night can’t get worse, I hear a *ding* on my phone. And guess who decided to send me a message?

We were completely platonic. I’ve dated people, and he’s casually seen people too, but we always had a solid friendship and give each other advices. He used to text me every day (mostly about memes or work gossips), ask for coffee break, bring me small thing and always made time for me. He’d remember small details about my life, and was just incredibly thoughtful. We stayed just as close after I left the job, still hanging out in a group or 1 on 1.

Then out of nowhere he started growing distant. He stopped texting me first completely, and when I reached out, he’d either act normal or ghost me for days. He started canceling plans last minute, making vague excuses, and overall seemed to be avoiding me (and no he's not seeing anyone). He also started lying a lot too and being so secretive when I asked. I caught onto one of his lies and made it clear that I knew. He kind of became normal-ish again, talking to me like before but still never initiates. If I don’t text first, we just don’t talk. It’s confusing because he clearly doesn’t want to cut me off completely, but he’s also no longer the friend he used to be. 

Why would someone do this? If he wanted distance, why not just be honest because I would understand. And if he regretted lying, why not fully come back?

1j55s8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1j55s8k/what_is_a_human/,What is a Human?,"In the old times, those distant, sepia-toned days of yore, a typical human came equipped with two legs, two arms, two eyes, a head, and a soft, squishy interior stuffed with bits and bobs that nobody fully understood but everyone agreed were very very important.

But by *Galactic Year 5047.95,* the whole idea of ""being human"" had become one of those infuriatingly nebulous concepts, like trying to determine the precise second at which a cup of tea stops being *""hot""* and becomes *""lukewarm.""*

The shift had been subtle at first. You'd be sitting in a pub, having a friendly debate about the meaning of life (still an absolute mystery), and suddenly you’d notice that half the people in the room were being held together with bits of metal and plastic. Eye glasses, pacemakers, replacement hips *etc.*

At first, no one seemed particularly bothered by this. After all, if Grandma could get an artificial knee and still bake you cookies, it was hard to argue that she wasn’t human. Then, one day, someone suggested that perhaps it would be a good idea if all humans could stop being so squishy. This seemed like a perfectly reasonable proposal, and soon cybernetic enhancements became the new fashion.

The first wave was simple: a shiny eye here, a huge metal hand there, and the occasional titanium spleen for those who felt their original spleens were underperforming. But, as with most things humans set their minds to, it didn’t stop there. By the end of the century, people were swapping out body parts like spare batteries and programming their brains to connect directly to each other.

Soon, there were arguments about whether someone with only 7% organic material could still be considered human. This led to the invention of the *""Humanity Index,""* a complex algorithm designed to measure just how human someone was, based on factors like biological tissue, emotional capacity, and how often they laughed at videos of other sentient beings (human or not) getting pranked.

Then, of course, came the genetic modifications. People started tweaking their genomes like they were editing a particularly bad novel, replacing *""prone to allergies""* with *""can breathe underwater""* and *""average height""* with *""looks like a Greek god but taller.""* Before long, there were people with gills, wings, and, in one particular case, six heads, each of which had different opinions on what to have for breakfast.

The galaxy was now populated by a dizzying array of beings who were technically descendants of Homo sapiens but looked and behaved like something out of a particularly creative fever dream. There was the accountant from *Zthrag-III* who had turned her entire body into a purple flamingo; the poet from *Tlgeuse-VI* who had rewritten her DNA to include the expressive range of a humpback whale; and the entire population of planet *New–New Zealand,* which had collectively decided to turn themselves into koalas.

The philosophers, of course, had a field millennium. They asked questions like, *""Is humanity defined by biology or by consciousness?""* and, *""If a person has no organic parts but still experiences the inexplicable discomfort of Mondays, are they still human?""*

These debates rumbled on for centuries, primarily in pretentious cafés where the coffee tasted as though it had been distilled through a sock that had recently participated in a marathon, and the chairs seemed specifically designed to discourage deep philosophical discussions by being too uncomfortable to sit in for more than five minutes.

The more ""serious"" academic discussions, however, took place in grand auditoriums with titles like *“The Pan-Dimensional Symposium on Ontological Obfuscations (Free Coffee and Biscuits),”* and on talk shows where impeccably groomed philosophers fervently debated the existence of the soul and whether humanity was teetering on the brink of extinction.

The Galactic Council finally decided to resolve the issue once and for all by passing the *""Universal Definition of Humanity Act"" (UDHA).* The act defined a human as *""any being who identifies as human, provided they possess at least a trace of human DNA and a reasonably convincing backstory.""*",27,1741294327.0,HFY,5,1.0,False

My girlfriend (Arri) and I have been dating since early October (5 months). We really hit it off, and chose to move in together at the end of January. Fast I know, but I truly felt good about this decision and was excited about the prospect. This relationship felt different than my past relationships and I could see things going long-term.

The first couple weeks of moving in together were pretty typical from that standpoint. Lots of boxes and reorganizing to do, and we both didn’t find a lot of time to do fun stuff with each other. At the end of the second week my mom came to visit and Arri and her did not get along whatsoever. This led to tension between me and Arri, who then said she was unhappy with my cleaning habits and wanted me to have higher standards. Some examples of stuff I was doing ""wrong"": left a dirty dish in the sink while saying goodbye to my mom before I left for school, left a water glass on the floor on my side of the bed, left a shirt on the floor, forgot to clean the lint trap after doing a load of laundry.
Personally, I felt like these were small offences, but nonetheless I agreed to raise my standards and be mindful of these things because at the end of the day I want her to be happy in the space. One week later she says she feels good about the changes I’ve been making and we have a valentine’s day date at home on Friday, and then she went to dogsit.
The following week (week 4 of living together) was good, and then that next weekend we took a trip out of state to visit her family which went overall well. We took a redeye back into town late at night (arrived 3 am) and on the bus to the shuttle lot we missed our stop. Quite honestly after all the small things that I did that bothered her in the house, I felt the need to save face so after talking to the bus driver I lied to her and said we hadn’t gotten to the stop yet and just needed to swing back around. After she found out she got extremely upset and gave me the cold shoulder for most of the next day.

I cooked dinner the next evening and used cucumbers in a soup, which she then referred to multiple times as a “stupid choice.” After I asked her what she was upset about, I apologized for lying on the bus, and also wrote a written apology and gave it to her the next day. For the most part she was pretty avoidant about talking more about this issue until last Friday when we finally sat down. To her credit, she did eventually apologize for berating me about the cucumbers in soup. However she then explained that ever since my mom came to visit she’s been building resentment against me for my lack of performing “basic adult tasks.” Here are some of the things she got angry with me about: putting a pizza directly on the oven rack (without a baking tray), not emptying the recycling when I filled it even though I needed to rush out the door to meet a friend, staining a dish towel, and forgetting what her daily schedule was. She also said she was disappointed I haven’t been taking initiative to plan dates which is true, but I had to remind her that we’ve been busy most of the weekends since moving in (5 out of 6) and on top of that, we’re both graduate students.

Still, I said that I would try to meet her standards and just asked for more patience which she seemed to agree to. I also said I would take more initiative with planning dates so I made plans for this coming weekend. I even made a weekly calendar so we could write down important things coming up in the week.

What hurts me about this conversation is that she said that she probably loves me less than I love her right now because of all the resentment she’s been building (I talked to my therapist about this, and he said that it seemed like a punishment).
Yesterday I came home before her after shopping for some nails/mounts to hang some shelves that she wanted me to put up. We both agreed that last night we would spend some time together to put them up. However when she came home she discovered that I had eaten some leftover rice (which she had previously said I could have as a snack) which she apparently wanted to use for cooking the meal she had planned (I had no knowledge of this). She got really annoyed with me as a result and was passive aggressive with me the whole evening. I spent some time putting up the shelves while she got ready for bed, and then I told her it was unfair of her to be treating me that way for something I had no control over. She acted all incredulous about that and we went to bed both ticked off.
The next morning I brought her coffee in bed (which I usually do) and then when she came out, she looked at the shelves that I had worked hard to put up and didn’t say a word to me. I had to ask her if they looked ok and then she just mumbled something like “they look nice” and walked out of the door.

I’m at a loss. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells all the time and that this could be the start of emotionally abusiveness behavior and I don’t really know what to do.",0,1741294116.0,relationships,5,0.33,False

**Cigarette smell**:

- I mixed baking soda in with the pieces then put them on trays & left them out in direct sunlight on my patio for the day. The box too, because it had the same smell. 

- I spread it out on a board and put in a room we don't use while I'm at work... / What worked for me was leaving it outside in the sun for a couple days to air out. Maybe if you've got a mesh bag and a covered area where you could leave the pieces outside? 

- You can try to put raw coffee beans into your box of puzzles for awhile too, it absorbs the odours and would give off a better smell while doing the puzzle in the future. 

- I had a puzzle with a bad musty smell which I resurrected. I spread out all the pieces back-side up, and sprayed an odor-eliminator/disinfectant product over all the pieces to make them slightly moist (I used a cloth to dab any places that were ‘wet’). I let it all dry, then did the same thing several more times. That got rid of the worst of it. After finishing the puzzle, I repeated spraying it, both front and back, once or twice before disassembling it. (I used a product called OdoBan that I had left over after dealing with a skunk which had died in the window well outside my home office... compared to the skunk, getting the musty smell out of the puzzle was easy)

- I would air it for a while - also maybe something like a scented drawer liner or a lavender bag, or scented beads (I found some on amazon) which could sit in the box. Also scented dryer sheets in the box would help. 

- You could try putting a dryer sheet in the box, or maybe put the pieces into a ziplock with the dryer sheet. Hope one of these ideas help you. 

- Maybe one of those bamboo charcoal deodorizing bags?

- Newspaper and charcoal are also odor removers. / My mom swears by crushed-up newspaper to reduce smells. Crumple some into each box and close it back up for a couple of days, then repeat as necessary. She used this trick on a long-stored coat that my sister wanted (sis is also sensitive to some smells) rather than washing it 50 times. (Mom puts newspaper into things like coolers to keep them from getting stinky as well.) 

**Musty smell**:

- Use bicarbonate of soda. Sprinkle a generous amount of the fine dry powder over the pieces and the box and it will get rid of or certainly reduce the mouldy or musty smell after a few days. You should notice a big difference. Keep moving the pieces around carefully for a couple of days or more (maybe transfer them to a clean cardboard box or even a plastic bag) until they have all mixed together well with the powder. You can keep adding fresh powder to the pieces every day or so and pour away the previous powder that has settled in the box. It won't stick. Make sure you use bicarbonate of soda and not baking powder which might work but I haven't tried it.

**Mouldy smell**:

- I would recommend baby powder. Since it’s mould you would want to dry out the puzzle and kill all the moulds. Applying baby powder would suck out all the moisture in the box. I would recommend to bury it in powder to maximise the drying process. Then subsequently you could just air and dust it out. 

**Smelly puzzle / Bad smell from new**:

- I would put it back in the box with a small bowl of baking soda. Leave it in the box for at least a week. I’ve heard some people sprinkle baking soda directly on the pieces but then you need to wipe each piece off. I wouldn’t use dryer sheets because then you are just swapping one smell for another.

- I use epsom salts to eliminate smells from things (especially smoky clothes). Fill a sachet, put it in and close the lid for a day or two.

- Public library staff here, and the most effective practice I’ve seen for deodorizing paper products is a sealed plastic container with a charcoal bag. That way, you’re not just covering one smell with another. For a puzzle, I’d leave the lids off at least and maybe spread the pieces around in the container if it’s super bad.  Activated charcoal is used in air filters and water filters usually, but in a tiny sealed space (like a plastic bin) it still does odor absorption things. 

- The box of baking soda with the rip off mesh sides. Put in the puzzle box with the pieces. / Put baking soda in a sock and tie it so the baking soda doesn't spill all over the puzzle. Put the sock inside the box for a few days.

- I’ve had luck de-stinking various things (though not puzzles specifically) with coffee grounds in a sealed container. Obviously keep the grounds in a small dish or on a plate and not directly on the puzzle or box itself. / I would stick a bowl bowl in the bottom of the box and fill it with coffee grounds. Pile up all the pieces around the bowl so the bowl isn’t covering any. 

- I had a perfumey-scented brand-new Ravensburger puzzle once. I stuck it in a closet with the pieces spread between two halves of the box and a packet of baking soda (I folded up a pile of it into a paper towel) in each. Changed out the baking soda after like a month or so and kinda stirred around the pieces. It ended up taking several months for the smell to dissipate enough for me to work on it (I’m very sensitive to fragrance).

- If you have access to an ozone purifier that is known to get rid of smells pretty successfully. Best done in a small room or enclosed area, then make sure you air or vent the area out really well after using to disperse the ozone build up.

- Dryer sheets in the box tends to help with cigarette smells, so I would imagine they would help here as well.

- Try sealing it in an airtight container with kitty litter and baking soda, for at least a week. Might help, depending on how strong the odor is... / I used cat litter with some old books and that helped, poured cat litter in a small garage can set the books in then closed the lid for a few days

- I wonder if the Odor Eater type packets for shoes would work here?

F18, in an all-girls school with three months left of highschool. I’ve been friends with my group for years—some for six years, some for two. We used to be really close, and they always said they hated hanging out without me. But a few months ago, while I was studying for a university entrance exam (which only one of them knew about), they started distancing themselves and hanging out without me. I kept making excuses for them, thinking maybe they assumed I was busy or wouldn’t be able to go.

Then, one of them (A) had a major exam, and I told her I missed her and to let me know when she was free. She ended up hanging out with the group without even telling me. When I confronted her, she said she thought the others had told me—they didn’t. Another friend (B), who was like a sister to me, used to hang out with me after every final. Two weeks ago, I invited her to go get a coffee, and she said her mom wouldn’t let her (even though I know her mom isn’t strict). Turns out, she lied. The next day, I saw her fully ready and hanging out with them.

Besides all this, they’re not the best influence on me. They introduced me to vaping at 15-16, and I’ve been addicted ever since. It’s not entirely their fault since I could’ve said no, but still. Now, I got into the best engineering university in my region early decision,  I've got a bright future ahead of me when they don't even care about academics. and I really want a fresh start.

The apartment manager provided me with a notice of a lease violation - referred to as a first warning - regarding the cleanliness of the apartment and provided another date for re-inspection in less than one week.

The notice only referred to a general provision in the lease stating I had to follow all rules but nothing specific. The cure provision was to clean the entirety of the apartment. I reached out to inquire about the specific rule I was considered in violation of as well as what specifically needed to be cleaned. I also noticed that I was missing a few personal items and brought that up with the apartment manager. I did not know that the apartment manager was the one to have inspected the apartment. Since then, the apartment manager reached out with additional claims.

1. No dogs, cats, or other animals of any kind are allowed in the Apartment, unless approved and registered with Landlord. Small caged and/or aquarium housed pets, not to exceed three pounds (3 lbs.) in weight, are permitted.  

I have an aquarium, and have had one since moving in. In prior inspections there have been no comments regarding them. The apartment manager now insists that I needed to have registered the fish. I believe it's allowed under the lease itself.

2. Permit any accumulation of refuse in the Apartment or anywhere in the Community

So far the only justification I have heard is that I had a takeout box from that days lunch on my coffee table and had a tied garbage bag by the door (inside my apartment).

3. Resident shall take good care of the Apartment and shall maintain Apartment in same condition as upon move in.

While it's not the same condition it was upon move in, I believe that's a result of normal use. The apartment was empty when I moved in. While it's not spotless, it certainly isn't completely filthy.

4. The comfort and rights of other residents must not be interfered with.  Resident agrees not to make loud noises, annoying sounds, disturbances, odors, nuisance or do anything else which interferes with or disturbs the rights, comfort or convenience of other residents or which interferes with or disturbs the Community staff.  Landlord is entitled to determine in its sole judgment whether you have violated this section.

The landlord now cites a text I was sent a couple months prior due to ""stomping."" This is the only notice I've received within the nearly 2 years I lived at this apartment.

What are my rights in this situation, I'm concerned that the apartment manager is trying to set me up for eviction. I'd like to avoid that, if at all possible, but moving may be difficult.",1,1741293580.0,TenantHelp,0,1.0,False

Based in UK, mostly milk based drinks (flat whites). Will be making once or twice a day for 1/2 people, occasionally entertaining.

What I like about the **Gaggia**: modifiable, the look, reputation

What I don't like: no PID so having to temp surf, changing OPV (believe the 9 bar is only standard in the US models now), steam wand pressure (or so I've read)

  
What I like about the **Lelit**: reputation, PID, pressure guage  
What I don't like: Not as modifiable (?), 57mm portafilter (it's very minor but it bugs me), prefer looks of Gaggia

  
I don't see this being the last coffee machine I buy, but I would like to enjoy it for 5yrs+. I've read the mods on the Gaggia, especially the Gaggiuino kit, take it to another level and it is something I would probably do eventually but maybe not for a year or so. I feel like the Lelit requires less work out the box for very good espresso whereas the Gaggia would maybe need some work. Is the Gaggia good enough initially without the mods (excl OPV)? Is the Lelit comparable to a modded out Gaggia?

  
I think if the Gaggia out the box, is good enough initially then I'll go with that and mod down the line but then I'm not a huge fan of the mods look.

  
Grinder wise I also would like some help, options: DF54/64, Eureka Mignon Silenzio/Zero/Specialita

My friends are already roasting me for it, so why not share the joy here?

So, last weekend, my boyfriend and I decided to have a *spontaneous* night. You know, like those couples you see in rom-coms where everything’s hot and heavy, and the night ends with fireworks? Yeah, I thought we could be one of those couples. *Big mistake.*

We were having a chill evening—Netflix, pizza, the usual—and out of nowhere, I got this crazy idea: *Why not spice things up?* I had this fantasy in my head where we’d get all steamy, the mood would be perfect, and I’d surprise him in the most seductive way possible. You know, like those scenes in the movies where the woman walks in, all confident and sexy, and the guy’s jaw drops? That was going to be me. Spoiler alert: it was not me.

I figured I'd make it *extra special,* so I thought, ""Let’s get some candles lit, put on some music, and get in the mood."" I had just learned how to do this dance on TikTok that I thought would be the *perfect* lead-in. You know, a little shimmy, a little twirl... I was going to get him *really* into it.

So, I’m in the living room, trying to get my moves down. Let me just say—I'm not a dancer. At all. But I thought if I added the ""sexy"" vibe and a little TikTok magic, he'd be *blown away.* Well, I started moving, and immediately, I knocked over a candle. No big deal, right? Just some wax. WRONG. The wax splattered onto the carpet, and in my panic, I slipped on the rug and fell straight onto the coffee table.

Now, imagine me—half-naked, sprawled on the floor, my hair all over the place, candles everywhere, and the sound of *Eye of the Tiger* blasting from the Bluetooth speaker (because I forgot to pause the playlist while I was setting up). It was *not* the seductive scene I had in mind. It was like an out-of-body experience where I was watching myself slowly destroy the vibe.

But here's the best part. Just as I’m laying there, trying to recover some dignity, I hear him in the hallway saying, ""Babe, are you okay?"" I try to stand up, but in my frantic attempt to look composed, I end up face-planting right into the rug.

He rushes over, concerned, and I’m like, “Yeah, I’m fine... just giving you a sneak peek of what’s to come.” (*Cringe, right?*) He chuckles nervously, unsure whether I’m joking or if I’m actually in pain.

But THEN, right when I think this whole night can’t get worse, I hear a *ding* on my phone. And guess who decided to send me a message?

*My mom.*

I've been back and forth with being trans or not because the whole social aspect is hard yknow, that's besides the point though.
Whenever I'd rant to my sister or anyone really about my gender issues it's always ""What about being a guy do you like?"", ""You can do all the things guys do as a girl."", ""Okay but I don't understand why you'd have to be a guy to do this."", or fucking whatever.
It's not just the things guys can do that girls can't that I envy. It's the smallest things.
Wearing my band T's as a guy. Singing as a guy. Laughing as a guy. Stargazing as a guy. Getting up at 5 am every morning to make coffee as a guy. Laying in bed and staring out my window on a blue, gloomy, mildly productive day as a guy. Just the mere thought of existing as a guy makes me so fucking happy.

No one around me could even begin to comprehend the way I feel about this. Not sound edgy or anything.

I seriously just don't understand how to make others understand. It's to the point where I just internalise everything because it's just hard to explain to everyone I talk to.

Museum tickets often cost \~$20 a head.

Question…

…If everyone is seeing the same paintings and exhibits…

Why does a large percentage of people pay the extra $100 a pop?

Everyone’s got reasons.

I think the biggest reason is…

Patrons wanna have an educational and entertaining experience (a result)...

But

They want someone else to make it happen.

Sound familiar?

Potential partners are the same.

They want the result I can give them.

HOW-FRICKIN’-EVER

They don’t want to babysit me…

Give me their opinions on who to sell to…

Dig up fifty-eleven sales assets and testimonials for me…

…Unless I’m letting them know how much their next payout will be.

The more likely the deal will happen.

Started skiing late in life when I started working at a ski and bike shop (I mountain biked). Learned a ton of the product, really liked it and started skiing on demos. Now I’ve owned maybe 10 pairs of skis in the last 4 years.

The problem I’m having is my local ski hill has 70m of vertical drop. I use to work a job where I had wednesdays off and would ski Wednesday mornings literally by myself on the hill. I’d go for 2 hours and gen 30-50 runs in and go home. It was great.

Now I work Monday to Friday I only have weekends off and on the weekends my local hill is 930-4pm only and the parking lot is always full and you’re waiting 10 times longer in line than you are skiing. So in an hour you’re lucky to get 7-10 runs even though you’re skiing for 20-30 seconds. The next issue is there’s nothing else to do. Pretty much just coffee, water and juice to buy and no real food. The chalet is basically just a bunch of people’s stuff thrown around on benches. I’ve lost all desire to ski here.

So my question is how do those with small local hills keep motivated? The biggest ski hill in the entire province is maybe 250m in elevation, but you’re spending $300 a night in a room, plus $100 per day for a lift ticket. It’s basically $1,000 for a weekend. Quebec has some decent skiing but you’re 8-13 hours each way driving.

I am envious of those of you who live closer to real mountains. For those of you that are in the same situation as me, do you basically only ski once or twice a season at a big resort (Utah, BC, Europe, Colorado, etc)?

Just feeling super depressed as I’ve skied 3 days this season when I use to ski 20-30 days a season when I had wednesdays off. ",10,1741292499.0,skiing,60,0.73,False
1j5515e,https://www.reddit.com/r/aliner/comments/1j5515e/how_my_friend_mark_transformed_his_life_with_the/,How My Friend Mark Transformed His Life with The Pineal Guardian,"Hey Reddit! I wanted to share an incredible story about my friend Mark (he’s 42 and lives in Austin, TX). Mark is one of those people who always seemed full of life—until a few years ago when things started to change. His energy dwindled, his focus became scattered, and he always talked about feeling like he was living in a constant fog.



I remember catching up with him over coffee last November. He admitted that he felt stuck, like he was just going through the motions of life. He had tried so many things—meditation, nootropics, even some intense detox diets—but nothing seemed to give him lasting results.



That’s when he came across something called The Pineal Guardian during a late-night internet search. Mark said he wasn’t expecting much, but the concept of detoxifying the pineal gland caught his attention. He’d never even heard of the pineal gland before, so he dug into the science behind it. Turns out, this tiny gland deep in our brain plays a huge role in regulating sleep, cognitive function, and even emotional balance.



The First Few Weeks: Small Changes Add Up



Mark ordered the product in early December and started taking it daily. At first, he didn’t notice much—just a slightly better mood here and there. But by the second week, things started to shift. He said waking up in the morning wasn’t such a battle anymore. Instead of hitting snooze five times, he actually felt rested and ready to start the day.



By the third week, Mark described this amazing sense of mental clarity. He called me one evening and said, “Dude, it feels like someone cleared all the tabs in my brain. I can focus again!” His creativity also came flooding back—he’s a freelance graphic designer, and he told me he hadn’t felt this inspired in years.



A Moment of Real Transformation



The real breakthrough came in late January. Mark told me he was driving home after a long day when a memory from his childhood suddenly popped into his head. It wasn’t just any memory—it was vivid and emotional, like he was re-living the moment. He said it was as if layers of stress and mental clutter had been peeled away, allowing him to reconnect with parts of himself he thought were long gone.



That’s when he knew The Pineal Guardian wasn’t just helping him with focus or energy—it was changing the way he experienced life.



Why It Worked for Mark



Mark believes the key was detoxifying his pineal gland. In his research, he learned that environmental toxins—like fluoride and heavy metals—can calcify this gland, making it harder for the body to regulate sleep, mood, and energy.



The Pineal Guardian is designed to gently cleanse and support the gland with natural ingredients. Mark loved that it wasn’t some harsh detox but rather a supplement he could easily incorporate into his daily routine.



Mark’s Honest Take



Of course, Mark was clear that this wasn’t an instant fix. It took consistent use over several weeks to see real results. He also mentioned a few things to consider:



Patience is Key: If you’re expecting overnight changes, this might not be for you. But if you stick with it, the results are worth it.



Taste: It’s a supplement, so it has a herbal flavor that might take some getting used to. Mark added it to his morning smoothie, which worked great for him.



Lifestyle Still Matters: While The Pineal Guardian helped a lot, Mark also made small lifestyle changes—like drinking more water and cutting back on late-night screen time—that enhanced the results.



Six Months Later



Fast forward to today, and Mark is a completely different person. His energy is through the roof, his focus is razor-sharp, and he’s back to tackling life with a sense of purpose and enthusiasm. He even started a new side project he’d been putting off for years.



What really struck me was when he said, “It feels like I’ve hit reset on my life. I’m not just surviving anymore—I’m thriving.”



Would I Recommend It?



After seeing what this did for Mark, I’m seriously considering giving it a try myself. If you’ve been feeling stuck in a mental fog or just want to see what your mind and body are truly capable of, The Pineal Guardian might be worth checking out.



I’d love to hear from anyone who’s tried it or something similar. Let’s share stories and tips in the comments!

Sure! Here are some honest reviews for *Pineal Guardian*, assuming it's a product, service, or concept related to enhancing or protecting the pineal gland, which is often associated with spiritual or mental well-being, intuition, or even lucid dreaming:

# 2. Constructive Review:

*""Pineal Guardian seems to offer some interesting insights, but I’m not sure I’ve seen any noticeable effects after using it for a few weeks. The product or service suggests it helps with mental clarity and spiritual awareness, but for me, it felt a bit like general wellness advice. It could be beneficial for those who are already invested in spiritual practices, but I didn’t experience any breakthroughs.

I would say I wonder about how they’re raised but I’ve served many many families and honestly it makes sense. Letting their children run amuck and touch waiter stations and decor, or running in and out of entrances. It obviously starts from their youth and the entitlement just gains interest like credit card as they age.

Ignoring signage and staff, seating themselves, often at dirty tables and then marching over annoyingly to ask why they haven’t been given menus. Putting dirty plates on neighbouring tables (this would literally get you told off in the UK), pushing chairs out and not pushing them back in, talking over each other while ordering or not responding to servers at all when we try to take orders or deliver food. They enter and exit through any door regardless of how obvious it is that it’s a staff only or fire escape, moving furniture without asking or moving to another table without asking or taking cutlery and menus or water glasses from neighbouring set tables instead of asking a staff members. 

Asking the kitchen for things directly instead of wait staff - this one honestly baffles me because where in the world do you EVER ask the chef to take your order or give you a condiment or for a menu? I know open kitchens are relatively new but come on! 

I’ve also never been berated by customers more than here and I’ve worked in the UK, which in theory should have way more entitled customers. Being extremely particular about what table you sit at and becoming irritated when your request is denied. No lie I had a woman ask for another server because I allegedly was “rude to her” for saying “I’m so sorry, this table is actually reserved, would I be able to move you to the next table over”. Funny thing is, I wasn’t even the one the asked her to move over, it was another Pasifika colleague that looks NOTHING like me. 

They’re also extremely impatient. Today alone, I had someone complain online that they waited 30 minutes for food and the restaurant was literally at capacity. 30 minutes? Are you actually being serious right now. I also had a woman stomp her feet like a petulant child after waiting 3 minutes for her coffee, while there was a visible crowd waiting alongside her. 

Any of this behaviour would have gotten me a clip round the ear as a child. So I don’t know who needs to hear this but have some fucking manners when you go outside please. For the love of God!",76,1741292412.0,auckland,88,0.74,False

Background

I (m21) have been with my girlfriend (f31) for off and on 3 years now. We are pretty strong as a couple, but recently there is an issue that we just can't seem to agree on.

For context, we do not live together, but my girlfriend lives in the same apartment complex that I do, just in a different building, and is over most nights

  
I am a person who sometimes has a hard time separating frustration from work, the drive (crazy drivers are where I'm at, I drive between 30 minutes to an hour each way on the highway) and home. Now, this isn't always an issue, I'd say it gets bad maybe once a month or maybe twice, where work and the drive sucked so badly that I either need a night to myself or if my girlfriend wants to come over, I give her a warning I may not be pleasant company, as a courtesy. This happened yesterday, as I was run off the road by someone on their phone on my way to work, then had to deal with that one co worker that everyone has that no one likes lol. 

  
So needless to say, I was pretty tight around 4pm and I still had 3 hours left in my shift. I shoot my gf a text and let her know that today is a day where I'm pretty heated and I'd understand if she doesn't want to hangout. She said she understood, and thanked me for informing her.

  
We call while I'm on the way home as we usually do and we talk some about what got me heated and we are doing decently. I'm not expressly mad, just mostly tired and a tad short at this point. She said she still wanted to come over, which I was fine with, as I had already warned her and she has been around while I've been like this before and it is usually fine. I hang up when I get home so I can cook myself dinner, we usually do food separate (usually in the same house though) as we have very different pallets. I am cooking, and the usual window for when she would come over has gone past 30 minutes. I text her to make sure she's okay and after not receiving a response for around 15 minutes ish, I call her. (this wasn't me trying to be a way, I just wanted to know if she was coming over so I would know if i should stay up for her. I go into work pretty early.)

  
She answers, and we get to talking. Things are fine on her end, but she says she doesn't really feel like leaving her house. I say that I completely understand, especially considering the circumstances. No hard feelings on my end, but I notice as we still talk for a few moments that she is withdrawn.  I ask what's going on, and eventually she tells me that she's sad I didn't say I wanted her over when she said she didn't want to come over. I respond that she gave very valid reasons as to why she didn't want to leave her house, that alone is enough for me to not press about her coming over. She gave me a reason and I wasn't going to be selfish and push through. I told her that, and I was told again that she didn't understand. I expressed again that she gave me a perfectly valid reason with not wanting to leave and that I respect her autonomy and didn't want to pressure or push, because she clearly has a good reason to stay home.

  
This caused a minor disagreement where we went somewhat back and forth, without raising our voices or anything, but it got somewhat heated. I still think I did nothing wrong, and especially given the mental space I was in, I was not wrong for how I handled it. Am I wrong? 

  
For context, I only am this concerned about it because she has a bad habit of turning things like this into full blown issues later, so when I see a problem, I would like to at least hear her side and know where she is coming from so we can both be heard by the other person and know that we see each other. I only explained myself as persistently as I did, as it seemed like she was trying to get why it seemed like I didn't want to see her.

Another piece of context, I do not go to her apartment. She is a tad bit anal about her house, which I am not as. It is completely fine that we have different boundaries, but I do not think I could handle how she usually gets about her house when I am already upset. ",3,1741292402.0,amiwrong,47,0.81,False

I thought I’d take a moment to discuss TedsWoodworking Plans, which I have been using for the past few months. Being a great fan of woodworking and at the same time a sufferer of the scarcity of good plans, TedsWoodworking has been an incredibly useful website.

Getting Started

On my first visit to TedsWoodworking, I was so struck by the fact the site provided more than sixteen thousand different plans. The site boasted to have the ‘World’s Largest Collection of 16,000 Wood Plans. ’ Although I doubted it, given the statement, I thought I could give it a try since they have a 60-day money-back guarantee.

My First Project

Now one of the first activities that I tried on my own was a simple coffee table. When it came to the plans, these were well-laid out and clearly structured. Some of the projects were accompanied by guidelines and suggestions that were easy to follow to the next step. The specific dimension and parts list helped me with shopping and I was able to get all the materials in one go.

The diagrams were so useful. The instructions themselves were very instructive and I didn’t have any doubts in my woodworking skills. Another positive change was that the included CAD software tool could be customized to some extent.

Building a Dollhouse

Feeling inspired by the coffee table I created, I endeavored to construct a dollhouse for my daughter. The specific design plans demonstrated how the project would look like from this view or that angle. The materials list was correct and the instructions provided were clear. The dollhouse was done in the next two days and when my daughter saw my creation, she was so happy.

Additional Resources

The TedsWoodworking package also contains video lessons that provide visual examples of intricate methods. These tutorials were useful supplement and provided benefits in comprehending and completing these projects. It also provides a guide on how to start a woodworking business, which is quite interesting even if one does not intend to make business out of it.

Pros and Cons

Pros:

· Comprehensive Plans: The plans are for all levels of expertise, including the first time carpenter to the professional woodworker.

·  Detailed Instructions: Clear and comprehensive diagrams, and easy to follow visual instructions.

·  Additional Tools: It is beneficial to use the CAD software, as well as the set of video tutorials.

·  Community Support: There is an active community online, which contributes tips and valuable advice.

Cons:

· Overwhelming Volume: It makes the casual user overwhelmed by the number of plans that are available.

· Special Tools Needed: In some cases, tools or materials used in the plan may not be easily accessible in every household.

· It takes a long time to download resources.

Summary

In summary, TedsWoodworking has changed my woodworking experience in a positive way. The detailing of the plans, the extended range, and additional accessories make it a worthy investment regardless of one’s experience in woodworking. The bonuses of customer support and the possibility to communicate in the community increase the likeliness of approaching projects with more confidence and achieving the goals.

I must enlighten every woodworker out there to ensure that they do not miss out on TedsWoodworking plans In general, people will always find some use in these plans whether they’re a newcomer or a veteran at the game.",1,1741292386.0,aliner,2,1.0,False

Ch. 1: Grease Trap
Morning cold drifts through the open window, stirring a young woman from restless sleep. Her hair is tangled, in need of a wash. The room is a fading palette of grays, the radiator in the far corner chugging heartily. Dark circles stain the skin beneath her eyes—since starting her new job, she’s been perpetually exhausted. She rises from her mattress, a makeshift bed of sheets and homemade quilts from her grandmother. No frame, no headboard. Just layers against the floor.
She didn’t sleep last night. Instead, she lay awake, watching the ceiling crumble. The upstairs neighbor was careless with noise, but silence wouldn’t have helped. The rhythmic thuds overhead struck like waves against a ship’s hull. Flakes of drywall drifted down, as light as dandruff from an unwashed head.
She imagines picking at the cracked surface like a scab, peeling it away in strips. Working from different angles, inching closer to the raw center. Scraping the flesh of the ceiling like a shovel collecting shattered rock. But it would only grow back—scarred, deformed, worse than before.
She forces herself up and trudges to the bathroom. Work starts soon. She’s an assistant to a local businessman—smart, dependable, tireless in making his life easier. But the effort is beginning to backfire.
Mr. Pembroke—an older gentleman, living off the wealth of his late father. The family fortune has dwindled since his father’s passing, but Pembroke is determined to build something of his own. His latest venture? Fried chicken.
Pembroke has carefully curated his image—an undeniable nod to Kentucky Fried Chicken’s Colonel Sanders. ‘Professor Pembroke’ is his own take on the old chicken magnate, though the imitation is hardly subtle. The same white suit, the same neatly groomed facial hair. Only a monocle sets him apart.
His restaurant chain, Prof. Pembroke’s Perfect Poultry, is thriving. Maybe it’s the familiar Southern imagery that keeps customers coming. Maybe it’s just the grease. Either way, expansion is underway, and with it, the woman’s sleepless nights.
She steps into the shower, the hot water stripping away the stale air clinging to her skin. The happy duck on her shampoo bottle makes her smile. After dressing, she barely gets through her first sip of coffee before her phone rings.
Pembroke (Boss).
She exhales before answering. “Hello?”
“Morning, kid. How’s it going?” Pembroke’s voice is thick with gravel, like he hasn’t cleared his throat all morning.
“Oh, y’know. It’s going.” She hopes, irrationally, that this is a call to give her the day off.
“Yeah, well, I need you down at the office. Something’s come up. We’re gonna be running around, so bring your driving gloves—I won’t have you veering into the middle lane again.”
She rolls her eyes. “Sir, I don’t see why the gloves are necessary—”
“I don’t wanna hear it. My car, my rules.” His impatience leaks through the receiver.
He launches into a lecture about road safety, pressing her into silence. She becomes his soundboard, his passive audience. Eventually, he hangs up, satisfied with his own wisdom. She grabs her keys and heads for the door.

Traffic is crawling. Some accident up ahead. The usual symphony of brake lights and honking horns. She grips the wheel, her jaw tightening. This drive usually takes exactly twenty-two minutes, but since becoming Pembroke’s personal chauffeur, she’s learned that time is never on her side.
A radio host rants through the static, something about a man who set himself on fire in front of the White House. They don’t say why. They only argue over whether it was a waste of gasoline. She turns the volume down and sparks a cigarette.
She pulls the cigarette’s tip red. The traffic light glows the same crimson, brake lights mirroring its demand: stop, wait, stay a while. Exhaust fumes rise as she exhales.
Pedestrians cross the street. In her mind, flames lick at their heels. Business suits and sun hats ignite like kindling. She watches, detached, imagining how far they could walk before their knees crisp and buckle. Would they collapse like butchered bones snapping under pressure?
The stench of burning flesh fills her nose—no, not real. Just the cigarette between her fingers. She flicks it out the window.
The light turns green. The cars creep forward.
Ahead, a box truck lies overturned, its cargo scattered across the pavement. Three men scramble through the street, grasping at something.
Crickets.
Their tiny bodies are smeared into the asphalt, crushed by the impact. Some survivors attempt to flee, their twitching legs dragging them toward gutters and shadows. The men are scooping them into glass jars.
She turns into the office parking lot.

Inside, the cricket accident is already old news. Jarrod, her closest work friend, stands in the break room, spreading an obscene amount of cream cheese onto a bagel.
Jarrod works in advertising for Pembroke. He complains about work; she listens. She complains about work; he listens. Simple. Effective.
But like most conversations, they sometimes miss each other—tossing numbers onto a conversational bingo card, always one square away from a win.
Still, neither of them mind. Sometimes, it’s enough just to be heard—even if it feels like talking to yourself.
She watches as a clump of cream cheese plops onto his tie. On instinct, she reaches to wipe it off.
Jarrod recoils. An awkward pause stretches between them.
She steps back, suddenly anxious. Maybe their boundaries are too firm. She mumbles something and walks away.

She knocks and steps into Pembroke’s office. He’s on the phone—something family-related, from the sound of it. She waits, scanning the room.
A new cardboard cutout of Professor Pembroke stands near his desk, towering at six-foot-two—a generous exaggeration of the real man’s height. Pembroke himself moves with a duckish gait, his bad hip forcing a lurching step.
He hangs up and rubs his chin. “Trouble getting in this morning?”
“Yeah, accident on the road. Some kind of pet store truck tipped over.”
“Shame how people drive these days.” He leans back in his chair, smug. “Which is exactly why I told you—driving gloves. Makes all the difference.”
She sighs. “Of course, sir.”
Pembroke shifts, getting serious. “I need you to drive me to a meeting. It’s not chicken business. Something about mineral rights my daddy bought a long time ago.”
His Kentucky accent, normally diluted by years in the city, thickens when he says daddy.
“They told me I need a witness. That’s you.”
“Wouldn’t your wife or daughter be better for something like this?”
“No. They wouldn’t understand.” He waves a dismissive hand. “I don’t need you to understand either. Just sit there, smile, and nod.”
His words go down rough, like his chunky protein shakes—always left with unmixed powder caked to his lips.
She plasters on a smile and nods.
“Good.” He settles into his chair. “Meet me outside in fifteen.”

Ch. 2: Family Trespasses
The corporate lobby is cold. Fluorescent lights stare down from recessed ceiling panels, glaring without warmth.
A red-haired secretary greets Pembroke and his assistant with a plastic smile. He approves—likes a woman who takes care of her appearance.
Pembroke scans the room, impatient. His assistant settles into a chair, flipping through a magazine. Viking Longboat Discovered in Pristine Condition, the cover reads.
He scoffs. A waste of space, preserving things like that.
A few others sit waiting. A woman in a pink blouse keeps a protective hand on the small girl beside her, a backpack with a safety tether clamped to her wrist.
A few seats down, a middle-aged man wipes beads of sweat from his brow, fingers tugging at his tie. A bad haircut. A suit that probably flops when he walks.
Pembroke is glad he isn’t him.
But unease simmers in his gut. He knows what this meeting is about, but the details have been vague.
Lobbies like this are built for quiet intimidation. Too much space. Too many seats. Close enough to hear other people breathe, but far enough to avoid eye contact. The kind of place that makes you feel smaller the longer you sit.
They offer small comforts—bowls of candy, stiff magazines, a mounted TV playing some procedural crime show. A silent effort to keep people from thinking too much about why they’re here.
A man enters. Blue pinstripe suit, white collar, dark skin. Salt-and-pepper goatee trimmed sharp.
He walks like he’s hitting his mark on a stage.
“Pembroke.”
Pembroke stands, his assistant rising beside him.
As they follow the man toward the conference room, she glances sideways at her boss.
“Vikings didn’t wear driving gloves while sailing,” she murmurs.
Pembroke smirks.

The conference room is oversized for the four people inside. A long mahogany table stretches across the room, built to seat twenty, but only one person is waiting.
A woman. Black blazer, crisp white undershirt. She stands as they enter, extending her hand.
Pembroke shakes it, his grip firm but wary. The man in pinstripes—Mike, as he introduces himself—joins her side.
She nods toward a seat. “Mr. Pembroke. Have a seat.”
They sit. Pembroke straightens, adjusting his suit. His assistant remains silent beside him.
“We appreciate you coming in today,” the woman—Sarah—begins, voice smooth but firm. “Before we begin, I just want to say—Mike and I both love your chicken.”
Mike nods. “That coating is something else. You’ll have to tell us your secret.”
Pembroke, caught off guard, lets out a breathy chuckle. “Oh, well, thank you. No secrets, really. Just quality and care in every bite.”
His assistant watches him stumble over his words, basking in their praise. Always selling.
She catches herself smiling and nodding along.
Then she feels it—the shift.
Sarah folds her hands on the table. The warmth in her tone cools.
“Mr. Pembroke, we asked you here today because someone has filed a claim on a portion of your family’s holdings in Kentucky.”
The color drains from Pembroke’s face. His chest tightens.
“Wait—what?” His voice jumps an octave. “What do you mean? That’s impossible.”
Sarah holds up a hand, steady. “Sir, I’m still speaking.”
Pembroke leans forward. “I have sole rights.”
She exhales, slow. “The claim has been filed by someone asserting that you share the same father. Legally, they may be entitled to a portion of the estate. We can arrange for your legal team to join this discussion, but—”
Pembroke slams a hand against the table. “What is this? Some kind of ambush?”
“No, sir,” Sarah says, voice unshaken. “These holdings have changed hands multiple times. We simply represent the interests at stake. The personal details—” she gestures lightly “—are just that. Personal.”
The assistant watches the tension unravel across the table. Pembroke’s face is tight, his usual smugness cracking under something deeper.
Mike sits beside Sarah, still, calm, hand resting on his knee. The ceiling fan hums above them, the only movement in the room.

Pembroke’s hands clench into fists.
“This is bullshit,” he mutters.
Sarah waits, unreadable. “You have options. We can settle this privately, or proceed through the courts.”
“Who is it?” Pembroke demands. “Who’s making the claim?”
Sarah slides a file across the table. Pembroke hesitates before snatching it up.
He flips it open.
His assistant leans slightly, catching glimpses of black-and-white documents. Birth records. Legal filings. A name he doesn’t say out loud.
His grip tightens on the folder.
“This is a joke,” he growls.
“Sir,” Mike interjects, calm but firm, “this is real. You’ll need to decide how you want to proceed.”
Silence stretches. Pembroke’s jaw shifts, working over unspoken words. His assistant, for the first time since stepping into the room, sees something rare flicker across his face.
Not anger.
Not arrogance.
Something smaller.
Something like fear.
Sarah leans back slightly, folding her arms. “If you need time to process—”
“I don’t,” Pembroke snaps, standing abruptly. His chair scrapes against the floor.
Sarah and Mike exchange glances but say nothing.
Pembroke turns to his assistant. “We’re leaving.”
She nods, rising from her chair, unsure whether to look at him or the people across the table.
Mike gestures toward the door. “We’ll be in touch.”
Pembroke storms out without another word. His assistant follows, but not before catching one last glance at Sarah.
She’s watching them.
Not unkind. Not smug.
Just watching.

Looking for advice on what setup would be best for my first espresso machine! Budget is around $100 and I'll mostly make milk drinks. I know with this budget I'm not going to get the best quality espresso, but I'm not picky and just trying to avoid the money I spend at coffee shops. I've done a ton of research and had my eye on facebook marketplace for a used machine, here are the options I'm considering:

Breville Barista Express Impress for $130- found this from a seller who's only had it for a year but was gifted a new machine so is now selling. I know the built in grinder won't be the best and it's a more than my original budget, but I honestly don't really care and like this option because of the convenience. (Also a great price for the machine I can't believe I found this!!!)

Delonghi Stilosa for $60 - this is initially what I was going to get, by buying it used I could spend around $50 for a grinder separately.

A lot of reddit posts similar to mine suggest a Moka pot - I've had a Moka pot for a few years and like the espresso it makes... but I've found that I don't like the process and it's annoying to clean so I end up just rarely using it. I leave for work early and want to be able to just turn on a machine and spend 3-5 min making my espresso. Everyone says ""the grinder is more important than the machine"" but with my Moka pot I have the shop grind my beans for me when I buy them and it's just fine for me. My main goal is what's going to give me the easiest clean up, but I don't want to waste my money on something crappy. Hopefully I can make upgrades down the road when I have more time, money, and curiosity. Open to other suggestions as well, let me know what you think. Thank you!",1,1741292177.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Personally, I really preferred the trail/park sections of crosstown trail, and think a finish at fort funston, towards the sunset on the west side of the city, makes much more sense, as well as frontloading the busier urban sections of the double cross (so it feels like it crescendos towards prettier nature, like the crosstown when you finish at lands end). Is there some good reason I’m missing that people seem to go the other direction? 

Also, if we do start at pier 23, anyone have suggestions for really special food/coffee stops along the route?

1j54th8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueNarcissisticAbuse/comments/1j54th8/is_my_girlfriend_f24_showing_signs_of_emotional/,Is my girlfriend (F24) showing signs of emotional abuse to me? (M27),"TLDR: I think my girlfriend is a perfectionist (and maybe narcissistic) and I'm walking on eggshells all the time

My girlfriend (Arri) and I have been dating since early October. We really hit it off, and chose to move in together at the end of January. Fast I know, but I truly felt good about this decision and was excited about the prospect. This relationship felt different than my past relationships and I could see things going long-term.

The first couple weeks of moving in together were pretty typical from that standpoint. Lots of boxes and reorganizing to do, and we both didn’t find a lot of time to do fun stuff with each other. At the end of the second week my mom came to visit and Arri and her did not get along whatsoever. This led to tension between me and Arri, who then said she was unhappy with my cleaning habits and wanted me to have higher standards. Some examples of stuff I was doing ""wrong"": left a dirty dish in the sink while saying goodbye to my mom before I left for school, left a water glass on the floor on my side of the bed, left a shirt on the floor, forgot to clean the lint trap after doing a load of laundry.

Personally, I felt like these were small offences, but nonetheless I agreed to raise my standards and be mindful of these things because at the end of the day I want her to be happy in the space. One week later she says she feels good about the changes I’ve been making and we have a valentine’s day date at home on Friday, and then she went to dogsit.

The following week (week 4 of living together) was good, and then that next weekend we took a trip out of state to visit her family which went overall well. We took a redeye back into town late at night (arrived 3 am) and on the bus to the shuttle lot we missed our stop. Quite honestly after all the small things that I did that bothered her in the house, I felt the need to save face so after talking to the bus driver I lied to her and said we hadn’t gotten to the stop yet and just needed to swing back around. After she found out she got extremely upset and gave me the cold shoulder for most of the next day.

I cooked dinner the next evening and used cucumbers in a soup, which she then referred to multiple times as a “stupid choice.” After I asked her what she was upset about, I apologized for lying on the bus, and also wrote a written apology and gave it to her the next day. For the most part she was pretty avoidant about talking more about this issue until last Friday when we finally sat down. To her credit, she did eventually apologize for berating me about the cucumbers in soup. However she then explained that ever since my mom came to visit she’s been building resentment against me for my lack of performing “basic adult tasks.” Here are some of the things she got angry with me about: putting a pizza directly on the oven rack (without a baking tray), not emptying the recycling when I filled it even though I needed to rush out the door to meet a friend, staining a dish towel, and forgetting what her daily schedule was. She also said she was disappointed I haven’t been taking initiative to plan dates which is true, but I had to remind her that we’ve been busy most of the weekends since moving in (5 out of 6) and on top of that, we’re both graduate students.

Still, I said that I would try to meet her standards and just asked for more patience which she seemed to agree to. I also said I would take more initiative with planning dates so I made plans for this coming weekend. I even made a weekly calendar so we could write down important things coming up in the week.

What hurts me about this conversation is that she said that she probably loves me less than I love her right now because of all the resentment she’s been building (I talked to my therapist about this, and he said that it seemed like a punishment).

Yesterday I came home before her after shopping for some nails/mounts to hang some shelves that she wanted me to put up. We both agreed that last night we would spend some time together to put them up. However when she came home she discovered that I had eaten some leftover rice (which she had previously said I could have as a snack) which she apparently wanted to use for cooking the meal she had planned (I had no knowledge of this). She got really annoyed with me as a result and was passive aggressive with me the whole evening. I spent some time putting up the shelves while she got ready for bed, and then I told her it was unfair of her to be treating me that way for something I had no control over. She acted all incredulous about that and we went to bed both ticked off.

The next morning I brought her coffee in bed (which I usually do) and then when she came out, she looked at the shelves that I had worked hard to put up and didn’t say a word to me. I had to ask her if they looked ok and then she just mumbled something like “they look nice” and walked out of the door.

I’m at a loss. I feel like I’m walking on eggshells all the time and that this could be the start of emotionally abusiveness behavior and I don’t really know what to do.",1,1741291910.0,TrueNarcissisticAbuse,0,1.0,False
