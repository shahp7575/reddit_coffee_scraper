1h1apuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1h1apuw/the_hunt_part_1/,The Hunt Part 1,"“This is stupid,” Mike said as he caught up with Fred. “It’s Friday night and I’m not getting laid.”

“I’m sure your hand will forgive you,” Fred snapped back, tired of his friend’s incessant complaining. “If I knew you were going to bitch this much, I’d have left you at home. Why can’t you be more like Neil? Tell him, Neil.”

“Leave me out of this.” Bringing up the rear, the scrawny teenager fixed his glasses as the trio stumbled along in the dark. This part of town had once been an industrial zone bordering a housing complex. The ruins of long-abandoned buildings, their doors and windows boarded up, only added to the sense of emptiness. Neil half-expected to see a bum slump out of the darkness to ask for change, only to offer a knife in the throat when they refused. “Where are we going?”

“Better be a whore house,” Mike muttered.

But Fred heard it loud and clear. “Is that all you think about?”

“That and your mom.”

“Fuck you.” Fred was leading the procession, the boys walking in single file along a fence laden with graffiti. Much as Mike pissed him off, Fred liked having him around for protection. The guy was built like a brick and could intimidate most anyone. He felt safer with Mike around, though he would never admit it.

Neil was the type to just go along with the group. The brains to Mike’s brawn, he fit the description of a nerd to a tee, especially with the binocular-sized glasses he wore. He was Mike’s foil and served as a good balance to their awkward trio. Fred wasn’t exactly sure what he brought to the group. Good looks, maybe? Yeah, that was it.

Following the fence, they came around the corner to a streetlamp that flickered so much it created a strobe-lighting effect. This made their shadows wax and wane against the fence, like they were being pulled and stretched to an inhumane length before being crushed back down. Only Neil seemed to notice this as he rushed to catch up with the other two. Cold, he pulled the collar of his sweater tight around him.

“Do you know where you’re going?” Mike asked, impatient. “I feel like I’m being jerked around.”

“You’d know,” Fred shot back. He expected Mike to fire back with a “mom joke” but held up his hand as if signaling a squad to come to a halt. “Yo!” He found it. A small opening along the fence just wide enough to fit through one at a time. There was a sign, just legible, around the mouth of the opening which read “Runners Here.”

“The fuck is this?” Mike said.

“Can’t you read? Oh wait, you can’t.” Fred nimbly dodged a smack to the head by rearing back. “That’s us.”

“The hell we running from? Pimps?”

“It’s a game, asshole. I told you this shit already.” Fred already had a leg through the gap. “You want play or go home?” It was a bit of a tight squeeze, but Fred managed to get through without a splinter. The other side of the fence looked like an abandoned junkyard. Disused furniture, broken appliances, and what looked like a blowup doll strapped to a punching bag. “Hey, sexy,” Fred whispered as he took a look around. Behind him, Mike struggled to put his impressive bulk through the hole while Fred stumbled in last.

Fred turned to both of them. “Alright, listen up. Only the best players get invited to the game, so Mike,” He turned to him. “behave, and Neil,” to the other, “try to lighten up.”

Fixing his glasses, which had come lose while he squeezed through the gap, Neil said, “I understand basic human interaction, Freddy.”

Mike patted Neil on the back so hard his glasses came off again. “Yeah, but you understand girls?”

Neil backed off, indignant. “It’s a game, dumbass!” Gritting his teeth, Neil fixed his glasses again and turned to Fred. “*The Hunt*? It sounds like a fancy name for Hide and Seek. What are we, four?”

“This ain’t just a game. It’s the *real* thing.” Seeing he had their attention, Fred elaborated further. “It makes Hide & Seek look like Hopscotch. Runners, that’s us, participate in a race where we can win money, fame, cards, even girls.”

“Liking the sound of that,” Mike said.

“However,” Fred went on, “This used to be a housing complex before everything went belly-up. They try to host these things in abandoned areas so they don’t attract attention.”

“How did you find out about it?” Neil asked in his aggravatingly curious voice.

“Connections.” Refusing to elaborate further, Fred continued. “Look, I don’t make the rules. I’m a player--and now so are you.” He stepped toward them. “Now from what I’ve heard, we’ll being filmed at all times. That means there will be people from all over the world watching us.”

“Watching us make fools of ourselves,” Neil said, unimpressed. “I can’t believe I agreed to this.”

Mike scoffed. “And out on another night watching porn? Sucks for you.”

“Fuck you, Mike.”

“Everyone wants to.”

“Easy!” Fred got between them. Maybe his role in the group was as peacekeeper. Mike and Neil barely got along at the best of times, and that’s when they weren’t cold and staggering about in the middle of the night. “Come on. We’re here to have a good time. Neil, you watch streaming shows all the time. This time, you’re the star. It’ll be your face everyone sees when they click PLAY. Mike, I heard the players get real physical. You don’t just run but fight to keep from being caught. You love knocking heads around, right?”

“Will there be girls there?”

“Everyone’s invited.”

“If that’s the case,” Neil began, “why all the secrecy?”

Fred shrugged. “The game’s not exactly legal.”

Neil stepped away. “I figured as much. Forget it. I don’t want to wind up in jail over some stupid game. You guys are idiots. I’m going home.” He turned to leave, only to have Fred block his path. “You mind?”

“Dude, we need a minimum of three players. It’s the rules.”

“I don’t care.”

“You only get one invite to the Hunt. You never get called back.”

“That’s on you.”

“That’s not right, man. Haven’t I always had your back? Even when we were kids, we were always together. Now, you did a lot of shit I wasn’t cool with, like that time we snuck into the ladies room in the mall because the men’s room was out of order. I told you to go outside and piss in the trees, but you didn’t listen to me.” Fred tapped his own chest. “I’m the one who got caught. I’m the one whose folks got a call from security. I’m the one who was banned from going there ever again.”

Knowing where this was going, Neil sighed. “But I wasn’t.”

“That’s right. You know why?”

“Because you didn’t tell anyone I was there.”

“Damn straight. I made such a commotion that nobody noticed you while you still had your pants down. I kept my mouth shut, didn’t even tell no one in school so you’d be embarrassed. I didn’t snitch.” Fred chuckled. “We both know that ain’t even the worst thing I did for you. But no matter what, I always looked out for you. Now I’m asking for your help.”

“Where was I when this happened?” Mike asked all of a sudden. “You pissed in the girl’s room? Shit, I’d have been all over that.”

Ignoring him, Neil said, “Come on, man. Please.”

“This is so stupid.”

“Please.”

“I can’t believe…alright, fine. However,” Reaching into his back pocket, Neil pulled out a facemask. “I’m going incognito. Deal?” Without waiting, he pulled the mask on, covering the lower part of his face. “You morons may want your face all over the internet, but I don’t.”

Fred clapped his hands. “My boy!” He flashed Mike a wink.

“You still wear that shit?”

“If the cops see this, I’ll be the only one they can’t accurately identify. Plus,” Neil pulled up his hood. “Gives an aura of mystery.”

“A what?”

“Aura. Au-ra. It means…you know what? Never mind.”

Looking up, the boys spotted a large structure in the distance, a dark monolith with only a handful of lights clinging to it like fireflies. Surrounding the building was a graveyard of failed dreams.

Fred only saw opportunity.

“Let’s go.”

\*

Walking towards the building, they spotted a large group of people in a clearing with a sign reading “Runners Welcome,” at the entrance. Each team consisted of three players, some wearing matching outfits or color-coding their attire. The clearing was surrounded by low-yield lamps powered by generators, at which the very center stood a raised dais. A pair of men wearing dark clothes stood by the dais to ensure that none of the runners approached it. Others like them moved about the opening, checking equipment, answering questions, or just standing around like statues.

One of the men approached Fred’s group as they walked in. “Name?” He said in a gravelly voice, carrying with him a pad on which several lines had been crossed out.

“Uh…Toadstool,” Fred replied.

The man looked him over once, then at his friends, before crossing another name off the list. “Welcome to The Hunt. Please remain to the side. The host will be out shortly.” That was that, and the man walked away.

Fred felt someone punch him from behind. “Toadstool?” Mike said in an incredulous voice. “The fuck is that?”

“Our team name,” Fred told him. “What? Did you think I’d be stupid enough to give them our real names? You want to see that guy coming to your home address and knocking at your door?”

“Toadstool?” Mike said again in utter disbelief. “What, ‘Dumbass’ was already taken?”

“It’s a reference to Mario Kart,” Neil explained. “Fred used to play that game all day. He sucked.”

“It makes us sound like potheads.” Mike glanced at the other teams. There were a couple of all-girl teams though none of the players particularly caught his eye. There was an attractive girl sitting on a guy’s lap, the two sucking face while their third player drank from a bottle. All wore distinct red sneakers to signify they were a team. “Shit. I’m going to get a drink.” Mike walked away to a makeshift concession stand, shaking his head, muttering “Toadstool.”

“Fred.” Neil had his hands in his pockets, trying to warm up. With his hood up and his mask on, he was unrecognizable to all save those who knew him. “How many people you think are watching us right now?”

Fred looked around and too notice of the cameras that had been placed beside each of the lamps. There was one by the concession stand where Mike was ordering a drink and if he didn’t know any better, he’d say that “bird” on the corner of the sky was a drone. Fred only noticed it because of the moon, which was hidden behind a wall of clouds and appeared little more than a white eyelash.

“Don’t know, bro. A lot.”

That seemed to make Neil nervous. “This stinks.”

“It’s a junkyard.”

“It’s a sham.” Neil lowered his voice when one of the men in black walked by. Only when he was safely away did he dare speak again. “I feel like this is some kind of flesh market and we’re the pigs.”

“I told you, it’s just a game.”

“I don’t’ know, Neil. This is just…it’s messing with me, alright?”

Seeing his friend shifting his balance from one foot to the other was making Fred feel self-conscious. Grabbing him by the shoulders, Fred forced him down to stop fidgeting and held him in place. He looked Neil right in the face. “Look man, I need you to get it together, okay? You losing your shit is going to make me lose my shit and you know that’s only going to make Mike happy. Do you want to see him happy? Me neither. So just chill.”

Neil remained tense, though he did stop fidgeting.

Mike returned with three beers in hand. “Time to man up, ladies.” After distributing the beers, Mike took one long swig before looking around. “The fuck’s up with the K.G.B agents?”

“Probably hired security. Don’’ want just anyone playing the game.” Neil took a swig. “Thanks for the beers, man.”

“What can I say? I ‘m a nice guy.”

“Bullshit.”

 “I am. Really. Just don’t piss me off.” Motioning to Neil. “What’s wrong with him?”

Fred looked to Neil who nursed his drink and kept looking around as if expecting to be attacked.

“He thinks this is a sham.”

“Could be. Who the hell holds a game out in a shithole like this?”

“So what do you think of the competition?”

Mike smiled. “Mostly pussies. Hippies and preps with nothing else to do on a Friday night.” Chuckling. “You know I heard a team calling themselves, ‘The Justice Heroes?’ I mean, the fuck are we,  Comic Con?”

“Suddenly Toadstool ain’t so bad anymore?”

“Fuck man. You should have asked. I’d have given us a cool name like The Crushers or Dead to Rights.”

“You lack imagination, Mike.”

Mike emptied his beer. “What name would you use, Neil?”

“Fuck it’s cold.”

“You see…now that’s original.”

“I’m not being cute. I’m seriously freezing my balls off.” He took a swig. “D-Don’t they have any coffee?”

“Yeah. Right by the cappuccino machine.”

“You’re such a dick.”

“That’s what your mom keeps telling me.”

“Fuck off.”

“Chill!” Fred got between them again. “I feel like I’m looking after a pair of kids. Could you relax?”

“He keeps talking shit about my mom.”

“So talk about my mom. I don’t give a fuck.” Mike’s face hardened at that. “Don’t know where that bitch is anyway…so it don’t bother me.”

The comment left an awkward silence in its wake.

“I’m getting another drink,” Mike said and walked off.

“He makes it really hard to like him,” Neil said in a hushed voice.

“He’s had a shitty life.”

“Doesn’t mean he has to be shitty to the rest of us.”

Fred opened his mouth, thought better of it, and shut up. Sometimes, it’s best to leave certain things unsaid. A bit of wisdom learned through years on the streets. It was said that you could choose your friends, but not your family. But Neil and Mike were as close to family as he ever had, so like it or not this was it. If they played their cards right and listened to him, maybe, just maybe, they could all come out of this a little bit better.

And a whole lot richer.

When Mike did return he was in brighter spirits, a sharp contrast to when he left. Fred knew it was a defense mechanism in dealing with a hard life. You kept your emotions in check and your heart closed, else anyone could walk all over you. While he hadn’t known Mike as long as he had Neil, Fred knew he could trust Mike when the chips were down. They’d been in enough scraps together to know they could count on the other in a fight.

This was it. This was Fred’s team. His family. Now if only they’d stop fighting, they could actually formulate a plan and focus. Mike’s initial assessment of the competition seemed spot on, but Fred was more scrutinizing than that. Whereas his friend only recognized strength, Fred knew that it was what you didn’t know that could kill you. Looking around, he spotted members of the other teams taking in the competition, just like he was. A guy in a yellow hoodie kept his head low to hide his face, but was secretly sizing up the competition. One of the members of an all-girl team was walking around, her head completely covered in a mask so that only her eyes were visible. She appeared casual but was secretly accessing the other teams’ strength and capabilities.

By the time it came for the game to start, Mike was already on his third drink. Neil was still trying to get warm, kneeling on the floor while blowing hot hair into his hands, when one of the men in black walked onto the dais. “Hello! Good evening, everyone. I wish to thank you for joining us this night. You are now participants in a very special game. Let me welcome you…to The Hunt!”

Several cheers went up at that. Mike raised his bottle, though he was half-buzzed. “Show us the fucking money!” He laughed.

“Let’s get this over with,” Neil said as he stepped up beside Fred.

“Not the right attitude, Neil.”

“God I’d kill for a coffee.”

“Tell you what: when we win, I’ll buy you a barista.”

 The host held up his hands to call for silence. “Yes. Now, I know you’re all eager to start and so are your competitors.”

Fred blinked. *Competitors?* Wasn’t everyone already here? He didn’t see any other teams show up. In fact, as far as he noticed, Toadstool was last team to arrive. So who was this guy talking about?

 The host walked back and forth on the dais like a commander addressing his troop. “First the rules.” He pointed. “You see that building? The goal of the game is to reach the top and ring the bell. Yes, you heard me. There is a silver bell on the roof. It must be rung to signify the end of The Hunt. So long as one member of your team does this, the whole team wins. Now that may sound simple enough, but be forewarned.” He raised his voice, all dramatic-like. “It is not! The entire course is booby-trapped.”

“Are you shitting me?” Neil said. “Did I hear that right?”

“Shh,” Fred said, his attention fully peaked.

“You must circumvent these traps, make your way through the junkyard and up the high-rise, which is also riddled with traps and other…surprises.” There were a few jeers at that. A few players appeared less enthusiastic than before. “But of course there is a catch.” He paused for dramatic effect. “You will be chased by an opposing team, the hunters. It will be their task to take each of you down by whatever means necessary. If an entire team loses its players, then that team is disqualified from the game. No exceptions. Remember, it only takes one team member to ring the bell, so even if all your friends are taken down, you can still win, so do not let that fact discourage you.

“As for the other runners, do not let them stand in your way. When it comes to your competitors, there are no rules. Do what you have to ensure the other teams do not win. Remember, it is you three against everybody else. They will not hesitate to push, kick, or beat you if it means winning. So yes, my friends, in addition to avoiding the traps and the hunters, you will have to contend with the other teams. The Hunt is a game unlike any other. Here, you play to win.”

“Yes!” Mike cracked his knuckles. “Love busting heads almost as I do busting nuts.”

“Don’t be gross, Mike,” Neil said to the side.

 The host raised his hand. “Now this next part is very important. Once the game starts, there is no turning back. Any attempt to leave the grounds will result in immediate disqualification.” He held his breath. “But there are no quitters here, yes?” Several “Nos” rang out, indicating the runners’ readiness to play. A few players, though, looked about as if looking for an exit. It was then Fred noticed several of the men in black appearing just on the periphery of the gathering. It was like being penned in. Fred began to wonder if perhaps the option to leave wasn’t really a choice at all. Not surprisingly, he looked behind them to see the way cut off by one of the men, the same one who had taken their name upon arrival. *The fuck?*

“Now then,” the host slapped his hands together. “Want to know what you’re all playing for?” More cheers rang out. The host raised his hand and one of his fellows brought out a suitcase. Beside him, Fred could see Mike’s eyes light up with excitement. Even Neil stopped shaking, seeming to just now fully appreciate their situation. The man held the suitcase up horizontally so that the host could open it up. Inside the case was nothing but green. Nothing but Benjamins.

“$1,000,000!” The host exclaimed. Whistles, cheers, and swears accompanied this revelation. “To the victors go the spoils!”

“Fuck me!” Mike bobbed up and down on his knees, appearing child-like all of a sudden. “Shit, man! That’s like…fuck! We’re going to be fucking millionaires!”

Neil turned to him. “You know split in three ways, that amounts to just $333,333, right?”

“Neil, shut up.” Mike shoved Fred in the shoulder. “You weren’t fucking around, man. This shit is real. I’m going to get so much pussy with that money.”

“Is that all you ever think about?” Neil snapped.

“That and…”

“My mom. You said that already, dickhead.”

“I was going to say cars, but yeah, your mom too.”

For once, Fred was too transfixed to break them up. Even over a quarter million dollars would be enough to change his life around. He could finally move out of his shitty apartment, go someplace nice, someplace warm. He’d never have to look back. One way or another, they were winning this thing.

The host closed the suitcase and the man walked off the dais. Once the cheers died down, he regarded each of the teams individually. “Now that’s worth playing for, eh? Now, in a few moments, I will sound the horn to begin the game. When that happens, you will all make for the building at full speed. Let nothing stand in your way. Not long after that, I will sound out a second horn, which will signal the hunters to begin. We want to make sure you have a head start. Fair warning, the hunters are dedicated. They will not stop, will not hesitate to take you down any way they can. My advice: run.”

“Fuck that,” Mike spoked up, “Hey!” The host turned to him. “Does that mean I can’t punch one in the face if he tries something?”

The host smiled. “You can try.”

“Someone’s getting knocked out,” Mike bragged.

“Now, I’ll give you a moment to talk strategy. The game will begin shortly.”

The boys turned around so that only they could hear each other.

“Listen,” Fred began, “Let’s be smart about this. What’s our strategy?”

Mike spoke up first. “Run like hell, man. Get to the building first, up the stairs, ring the bell.”

“And that’s why the Neanderthals died out,” Neil said.

“Got something to say, pencil dick?” The jock snapped.

“Yes. You’re a moron. Look, most of the other teams are going to do one of two things: run or fight. Running across an obstacle course full of traps is bad enough, fighting everyone along the way is suicide. I say we hold back, stay behind the other teams and let them trigger the traps. When we see teams fighting each other, we either run past them or let them wear each out before fighting whoever’s left standing. Either way, we’ll have less competition and reserve our strength for when we need it.”

“I knew we kept you around for a reason.” Fred patted him on the head, which only annoyed him.

Mike wasn’t so impressed. “Yeah, and while we’re dicking around in the back, one of the faster teams will get to the building first and ring that bell. Do you know what a race is?”

“I’m not saying we just walk, stupid. But we need to pace ourselves.” Neil took a look around. “How about we keep behind one of the physically weaker teams. That way, if we have to fight them, our chances will be better.”

Fred turned to Mike. “Well?”

“Shit, man. I want to fight,”

“But do you want to be rich?”

He thought about it. “Yeah. Yeah, I do.”

“Good.”

“There’s just one problem.” They both look back to Neil. “The hunters. I don’t know how many of them there are or what they can do. So I’m open to suggestions.”

Mike had one. “You heard the boss. He said we can punch them out if they try something.”

“I don’t trust him. I mean, they have to be special if they’re hunting us. What threat can they be otherwise?”

Fred hated to admit it, but Neil made sense. He sucked at math, but he knew how bad unknown variables could be. “Then we keep our heads down, follow the other teams, fight when we have to, and try to stay away from the hunters.”

“But if one shows up…”

“…then you can punch him in the face, Mike.”

“Nice.”

“Kay, break.”

Once the teams had finished their strategy, the host spoke up again. In his hand he held a blowhorn. Looking out at the crowd before him, his smile went from ear to ear. It seemed…predatory. “Alright then! Runners, are you ready?” The teams let out their affirmation. “Remember…first to that bell wins! Now,” He held up the horn. “You have a five-minute head start. Make it count.” The teams lined up by the dais, all facing the building in the distance. A few barbs were being exchanged, some downright insults and even a couple of threats.

“It’s going to be one of those games.” Mike appeared like a linebacker ready to attack the defensive line. He licked his lips in anticipation. Fred smiled. They could win this, he thought. The three of them. Team Toadstool.

Funny how that name sounded less cool in his head than saying it out loud.

“Get ready for…” the host held up the horn, “The Hunt!” The blowhorn was deafening, but it was soon drowned out by the hoots and hollers of the contestants as the runners burst into action. At first they were all neck-and-neck, the teams moving in unison deeper into the junkyard, but as soon as space became limited, they started to split up. One team already fell into fighting, the runners exchanging blows.

“Aw man,” Mike said, though he stayed the course and remained with his friends.

The teams who were fighting seemed to have forgotten all about the race, throwing punches and rolling around on the floor. Mike laughed as one of them smashed another’s face against a disused refrigerator.

“Holy shit!” Mike laughed.

They put the dais behind them and plunged into the junkyard.

\*

There wasn’t much light and the boys found themselves stumbling more than running. The building seemed further away than before, though it could have been a trick of the darkness. They started to bump into things. Heavy things. Sharp things.

“The fuck are we going?” Mike said, waiting for the others to catch up.

Neil bumped into Fred when he came to a sudden stop.

“Either of you brought a flashlight?”

Fred shook his head to Mike’s question, realized his friend couldn’t see it, and spoke up instead. “Nah.”

“Neil the Eel?”

“No, Mike. If I knew I’d be running for my life at midnight, then maybe. But I didn’t.”

“And me without my matches,” Fred said. Somewhere to the side, something heavy, metallic, struck the ground. Somebody screamed. “What was that?”

“One of the traps,” Neil said. “I think somebody’s hurt.” The scream turned into wailing. “Seriously hurt.” He turned to Fred with a look of concern. “I don’t think this is really a game, Fred. We could get seriously hurt.”

“You gonna puss out?”

Neil glared at Mike. “I’m serious! I wouldn’t mind winning, but I don’t want to lose my head while doing it.”

“Both of you just need to stay behind me. I’ll win this.” Mike punched his knuckles together, eager to put them to use. “Let’s go.” He ran off before they could stop him.

“Shit. Come on.” Fred grabbed Neil by the arm and pushed him forward. They had a solid strategy…so long as each of them played their part. Right now, the only person Fred trusted not to flake out of it was himself. Mike was too gung-ho for valence and Neil was only just keeping it together. And the race just started.

They heard a scuffle coming off to their left where a wall of junk blocked their view. Something fell off the top of the heap and clambered down toward them. “Watch it!” Fred pushed Neil out of the way as a broken window fan shattered upon hitting the ground just inches where Neil had been.

“I’m bleeding!” They heard someone yell on the other side. It sounded like a man whose voice went up a few octaves. “It won’t stop. Oh, God. Somebody help me!”

“Keep moving,” Fred snapped. All around them, they could hear fights breaking out, teams choosing to throw down instead of making a beeline for the building, which is what they should have been doing. Perhaps they thought taking out the competition made their chances at victory easier, not realizing fighting should be a last resort. What good is taking out the other players if you lost an eye, an arm, or leg doing it?

Last thing Fred wanted to do was waste his newfound wealth on expensive surgery. He had plans for that money. He…

Someone collided with him, slamming his body to the ground. Fred felt the breath in his lungs leap into the air like a cat startled from its sleep. In the dark he could see a shadow looming over him, straddling him on both sides, holding something heavy in its hands. But Neil was there before the shadow could do anything. He tackled the assailant, forcing him off Fred, buying him the time needed to recover. Once he was back on his feet, Fred realized that the attacker wasn’t alone. His teammates were right behind him, two of them cornering Mike who was exchanging blows like a trained boxer.

Fred had a choice to make. Mike looked to be holding his own and was larger than those attacking him. Neil, brave as he was, was already losing the fight against the other runner, who had already rolled him around so as to be on top. The runner began taking swipes, forcing Neil to cover his face.

“Par for the course!” Fred moved forward and kicked the attacker in the back of the head. The runner fell over, groaning, allowing Neil to roll away. Fred didn’t wait for the runner to get back up. Turning him over, Fred punched him once, twice, three times in the face. He could feel blood on his fist as he drew back, hearing the tell-tale sound of a broken nose. The runner went limp.

“Watch him,” he told Neil as he went over to see help Mike. Somehow the assailants had managed to push Mike back against a wall of refuse, striking him from both sides. Fred noticed one of them had a weapon, a steel bar picked up from somewhere. He swung and narrowly missed Mike’s head.

“Hey!”

The one with the bar looked around just as Fred punched him in the face. He managed to hold onto the makeshift weapon, however, and swung blindly to keep Fred at bay. Mike charged the other guy, who seemed less than enthusiastic now that it was one-on-one. Reaching out, Fred grabbed the arm swinging the bar and punched the guy in the gut, reeling him over. A quick elbow between the shoulder blades and the back of the neck put the runner down for good. The bar clanged to the floor and Fred kicked him a couple of times to make sure he didn’t get back up.

Gasping, he decided to take the metal bar. Neil walked up to him, also out of breath. “Thanks.”

“That was some tackle. Wonder why one of them didn’t go after you.”

“Probably didn’t see me. I am small.”

“You helped me out, man. Don’t sell yourself short.” Fred swung the bar a couple of times to get a feel for it. Comfortable, he looked to see Mike walking back to them, grumbling. “What happened?”

“Bitch ran away before I could clock him. Got me all worked up for nothing. What’s that?”

“What’s it look like, man?”

“Give it to glasses. He needs a weapon.”

Fred did offer the bar to Neil who declined. “You sure?”

“You saw how I did. I’m not a fighter.”

“You ain’t a lover either.”

“And you ran right into that ambush,” Neil spat at Mike. “They were waiting for another team to run by.” He looked back the way they came. “If that fan hadn’t slowed us down when it did, all three of us would have been caught by surprise.”

Feeling the weight of the bar, which was actually a metal beam from a large piece of furniture, Fred felt his body tense up. “These guys are playing for keeps.”

“So should we.” Mike kicked the guy on the floor before going through his pockets.

“The hell are you doing?” Neil asked.

In time, Mike pulled out a lighter and smiled. “Getting my spoils.” He lit it up.

“Put that out!” Neil snapped. “You’ll give us away.”

When Mike complied, Fred decided his brawny friend had the right of it and searched the guy who tackled him. Sadly, he had nothing of use in his pockets. “Damn.” From somewhere came a great commotion as a mountain of trash came down. Fred thought he heard someone scream but wasn’t sure. Playing for keeps didn’t cut it.

“Guys,” Neil began, “I’m not sure I want to do this anymore.”

“If we leave, we’re disqualified. We have to reach the end.” Fred stood up. He thought he heard another team heading their way. “Keep to the sides, move slowly. In fact, Mike, let me take the lead.”

“Why?”

“I want to keep you in reserve. In case we get into a fight, I want them to see you last and piss their pants when you come out swinging. Neil, I want that brain of yours thinking. I want strategies we can use. You’re the hilt. I’m the pommel and Mike is the sword. Good?”

“Whatever, Mike said, though he didn’t like being in the back. “I swear if you fall Neil, I’m running over you.”

Exasperated, Fred said, “Let’s go.”

Taking the lead, Fred took them around a narrow pass that split into a fork. He stopped when he saw something on the ground. It looked like…*oh shit*…a body! It was lying face-down on the ground with one arm twisted at an odd angle. Fred approached it carefully, as if expecting another ambush. But his fears were unfounded as no runners struck sprang out at them.

“Oh fuck,” he heard Neil swear.

“Damn,” Mike swore. “I mean…damn.”

“Is he…?” Neil asked.

Walking over, Fred nudged the body only to hear it moan. “Still alive. But barely.”

“Should we…”

Fred cut Neil off. “We can’t man. I’m sorry, but we got a race to win.”

“But shit, Fred. He needs help. Look at his arm. The guy needs a hospital.”

“We can’t help him.”

“You mean we’re not doing anything?”

Fred turned around. “If that was you on the ground, you think he’d help? That guy back there was about to bash my face in when you came around. One of them wanted to use Mike’s head as a baseball. This isn’t just a race, Neil. It’s life or death.”

“But he’s not dead.”

“Then the faster we win, the faster he gets help. You want him to live? Then let’s find that bell and win this shit.” Fred’s tone indicated the argument was over. He stepped over the poor man as if he were little more than a hobo on the street. He knew Neil was smart, but the guy could be a bleeding heart sometimes. It’s why Fred always had to protect him when they were kids. He’d get picked on all the time at school. He hoped Neil would grow up quick.

Moments later, they met with their first obstacle. A series of metal bars had been arranged like a cage within a large clearing. Doubling back would take too much time and the walls around them were too high and unstable to climb, so there was no choice but forward. Fred led the way, finding the path through to be easy and simplistic, almost as if made for a child. Then the space began to narrow and soon he was walking sideways. He was soon forced to duck his head and hunch his shoulders.

“Fuck this!” Mike said from the back. “Fred, what is this shit?”

“Are we almost there?” Neil asked.

“We’re here,” Fred said as he stumbled into the middle of the cage. The space was a box just wide enough for the three of them to fit in together. There was a hole at the opposite end from where they entered.

“It’s like we’re in kindergarten,” Neil said. “You going in?”

“Can’t tell you how many times I heard that,” Mike joked.

“Shut up, Mike,” Fred said as he took a look inside. The hole went in for some way before veering to the right. “Guess we’re doing this.” Fred ducked inside, tucking the metal bar in his shirt for safe keeping. Though tight, he managed to squirm in while moving on all fours. Holes had been dug into the tunnel so that he could just see his way. “Let’s go,” he called out behind him. There was enough room for him to look over his shoulder and he could see his friends catching up.

Once Fred turned the corner, he felt a sharp pinch in his hand, forcing him to stop. “You whore!” he snapped. Something crunched underneath him as he moved, His other hand was pricked as well. “Neil!”

“What?” His friend’s voice said from far back.

“Ask Mike to give me the lighter. I need to see something.”

After some work, Neil managed to pass the lighter forward, which meant sliding it between Fred’s knees. Fred picked up the lighter and flicked it on. “Oh you gotta be…”

Broken glass lined the interior, stretching all the way down the tunnel.

“What is it?” Neil asked.

“There’s broken glass in here!”

“What?”

“What?! Mike mimicked.

As Neil relayed the information, Fred held the lighter as far out as he could. Some sadistic asshole had coated the whole interior of the tunnel with glass. “Guys. We have to go back.”

There came a loud bang that sounded like a metal hatch coming down. Fred heard Mike scream. “Mike!”

“Someone shut the fucking door!”

 “Door? What door?” Fred hadn’t seen a door. “Can we get out?” He heard commotion behind him as Mike scrambled around. Then it sounded like he was kicking the door down. After several failed attempts, Mike swore like a man possessed. “It’s sealed shut!”

“Fred…what kind of game is this?”

He could hear the tremor in Neil’s voice, hear his rasped breathing. Truth be told, Fred was doing all he could to keep it together. He wasn’t particularly afraid of tight spaces, but being shut inside the tunnel, in the dark, made him feel like he was in a coffin.

Then he heard it.

“Mike get us out of here,” he managed to blurt out before the tunnel began spinning, slowly at first, but picking up speed as it went. The light bounced around as he did, and it took all the conscious effort he had left not to drop the lighter. Neil and Mike screamed and cursed, respectively, both realizing the sudden danger they were in.

Suddenly, and to Fred’s surprise, he saw a door slide open at the end of the tunnel. A way out!

“Come on!” With the tunnel spinning, it was near impossible to stay upright. Fred crawled as best he could, feeling the glass bits slice at his clothes and skin. His main concern was not to cut his face and Fred held back a scream as his hands bled from a hundred places. From time to time, his head would scrap against the sides. He felt a small bit of his ear come off and screamed bloody murder. Behind him, Mike and Neil were also being minced, yet they all urgently rushed as fast as they could through the tunnel.

Fred shot out head-first, rolling onto a small decline and into a pool of muddy water. He came up gasping and cursing, stumbling about in pain and surprise. Behind him, Neil splashed into the water and Mike behind him. The door slid shut and they were trapped in the waist-high pool. It extended to about twenty feet down a small canal with steep walls to either side. Most shocking of all was the metal bars that hung menacingly overhead.

“What is going on?” Neil cried out. Covered, his face suffered the least cuts, but his hands were bleeding all over the place. “Oh, Christ. Is this water sanitary? We could get infected!”

“Hey assholes!” Mike screamed at a camera which was posted along the wall beyond the bars. “I want to talk to your boss. I’ve got a few *complaints*!”

“This isn’t funny anymore, Fred. I want to go home.”

“Neil…I don’t…we made it, didn’t we?”

“This is bullshit!”

“Stop screaming!”

“You’re screaming!”

“Hey dickwads,” Mike called to get their attention. “You hear that?”

They listened. A whirring sound, like something powering up, drew their attention upward. Electricity coursed through the metal bars as they slowly began to descend towards the water. Fred called for them to move but needn’t have bothered as they all ran in unison. Wading through the water stalled their progress, and they fast waddled as best they could towards the end. Fred pulled himself out of the pool first, reaching back to grab Neil who was nearly thrown out of the water by Mike.

“Mike!”

The brawny youth barely had time to pull himself out as the bars splashed into the water, sending sparks and smoke into the air. The trio collapsed sideways, realizing just how close they came to death.

“Hey guys,” Fred said after he caught his breath. They both looked to him. “I think I just pissed myself.”

I’m a 33-year-old Italian guy, 5'6"" (168 cm), 67kg, with green eyes, brown hair, and a stubble beard. I like to stay active, and I’d say I’m in decent shape.

**What I’m Into**  
I’ve got a wide range of interests, but snowboarding is my true passion. Outside of that, I love go-karting, hitting the gym regularly, and generally enjoying the outdoors.

I’m also into more low-key stuff like board games, watching F1, watching anime, reading manga (currently working through One Piece), gaming (sporadically), and starting new TV series that I may never finish. I love a chilled movie night or diving into new music too (metal, rock, EDM are my go-to genres), and I’m always down to grab drinks or clubbing.

**What I’m Looking For**  
I’m looking for someone open-minded and fun to be around, preferably in their 20s or early 30s. Communication is important to me, and I’d love to meet someone who feels the same. Ideally, you’d be based in or near London so we could meet up more easily. I’m not in a rush, I’d love to start by chatting a bit and getting to know each other first.

Leading up to the election, I paid attention to the news, so the reassurances they issued were hollow. In a world where nothing else seems trustworthy, trust in yourself. Doubt everything else. So, rather than work from the premise the election was secure, I just assumed there was a way in some regard.

What I found was incredibly concerning, and I contacted everyone I could. I reported on every website, called every hotline, everything. Nobody seemed to care, it was so bewildering. Honestly the FBI lady was incredibly rude. After spiraling, it occurred to me that maybe the reason why they weren’t alarmed was that I wasn’t telling them anything they didn’t already know.

Prior to the election, I’d read about how Elon needed to inflate views of his posts and coded in some artificial boosting algorithm to be the most viewed. He'd also said something about how changing a vote was a matter of changing a code, so I wanted to figure out exactly what he meant by that, given the party’s tendency to tattle on itself.

Activist group Led By Donkeys published a video detailing the timeline of Elon, Twitter, and the election. There’s a lot of talk of Starlink, and Elon didn’t help by demolishing two satellites. He was very openly critical about vulnerabilities in Dominion software, and it sounded like he knew exactly how to exploit them. Which they did know, because they were allowed to examine the machines  as evidence in their 2020 interference case.

But looking into it further, there were massive breaches of voter equipment and software. It’s honestly so many instances, it’s hard to catalog. In Michigan, there’s been a VAT up for sale on eBay, 5 voting tabulators borrowed and returned damaged, and another missing machine that was never found. Colorado had images of voting  software and passwords posted online in one incident, then a spreadsheet of partial passwords posted online.

But for the manner, look no further than Coffee County, Ga. Pretty much everything happened there: breaches of software and equipment, information posted online, encryption keys in plain view, voting database accessed. Due to ransomware attack over the spring, the state needed to block Coffee County’s connection to election databases.

The trend continues in DeKalb, Fulton, and other Georgia counties. It continues in other swing states and their counties. Breaches of software, machines, databases. Ransomware attack on some  government departments 3-6 months before the election. Over and over. Some stories have had additional information about who is responsible, in Fulton County it was allegedly the Russian hacking group, Lockbit.

Voter interference can be indirect too. Michigan is 10th for population, it’s a large state voter base wise. Largest city is Detroit with 640k, next largest is Lansing at only 112k, so more than 500k difference between. Ballots from Detroit either weren’t even all in the building, or hadn’t been processed by 10 am Wednesday, well after it was called for Trump. Pennsylvania with Philadelphia, and even Pittsburgh, is incredibly similar. It’s an easy way to manipulate public perception on vote counting and cheating. Those votes won’t favor Republicans anyway, so the more they can disqualify, the better.

In terms of security, at initial pass Pennsylvania seemed like it would be a non issue. It too, has been the recipient of ransomware attacks, particularly in the swing counties. For example, Bucks County 911 system was the target of the Akira hacking group at the beginning of the year, and was down for two weeks. It’s also a good example of the legal efforts to suppress the vote. Pennsylvania was key to understanding everything.

For the record, I am very familiar with Allegheny County and Philadelphia County, PA. The voter distribution in the state tends to be divided into 1/3 D, 1/3 R, and the final 1/3 is actually Unaffiliated, but to people who aren’t as smart as they think they are (EMDT), it might seem like they have a large base of registered Independents. They aren’t, and in elections they too tend to split into something like 1/3 D, 1/3 R, and that final 1/3 is the swing vote.

Most of Pennsylvania was counted fairly quickly because most of Pennsylvania is essentially grass. Except for the two largest countries, Philadelphia and Allegheny. In the last election, both turned the tide for PA toward the end, and decided the outcome, so those races were the ones I watched like a hawk. In Pennsylvania, mail in ballots cannot be counted until Election Day, either. So big chunks of democratic votes are added toward the end of the count.

Except, the election was called by 5:00 the following morning for PA. At the time, I believe the state was 96% reported (P).  By 11/11, the total PA vote had progressed to 99% in (P) and 98% (S). Philadelphia was still 95% (P), 93% (S). Even though more votes kept coming in, they weren’t for Trump, so this notion that there’s this massive red shift relies on undercounted blue votes. There would’ve been a shift in the total for Trump as Philly came in, had that been true. Not to mention, past election data doesn’t support it. Philadelphia experienced more blue shifts even in off year elections. 

I did math to estimate how many votes remained, and a significant number were outstanding. When I compared the voter registration database for Philly to the votes incoming, an interesting trend emerged: Trump had votes well beyond his registered base, but Democrats and Independents had dramatic shifts of their base not turning up. Comparing it to the state, just at first pass it seems like the base split into that typical Unaffiliated 1/3 D, 1/3 R, with that final 1/3 being the shift to R. But, that breaks down completely in Philadelphia, where there’s been a consistent increase in registered D to R. In Philadelphia, registered R voters have decreased to only 12% R. A similar shift was observed in Allegheny County, which had been trending D both in registered and actual voters. In my opinion, the vote counting for these counties slowed because the problem started to show up. 

In Pennsylvania, so much of the voter base was mobilized because of abortion access, no matter what the polls say. Healthcare is the primary industry in both Allegheny and Philadelphia Counties. Restrictions on abortion have made an access desert for abortion or even more difficult pregnancy care, and is gets worse going southwest. Allegheny County has become of the closest and easiest places to access care, and everywhere was booked. People living here can’t get timely urgent or emergent pregnancy care; I was one of them. Abortion brought voters out in 2021, 2022, and 2023. Statistics can be manipulated, that’s what I’ve seen a lot of. But feet on the ground, the reports don’t mesh with observations.

Voting machines allegedly don’t use the internet, but they must transmit data somehow. It seemed like that was the answer, it was either something with a memory card or a data stick, or something with their network. They claim the network is secure and air gapped, but it doesn’t take much research to see how obsolete and vulnerable our systems are. Georgia’s elections are horribly susceptible, but the state pretty much said: we know, but it’s too hard to replace machines atm so good luck everyone.",7,1732730188.0,somethingiswrong2024,0,0.68,False

Should I just ask him out on a date without mentioning the car?

Should I even call it a date? We don’t know each other too well (had a few surface level convos) but  he’s handsome and seems like a kind a chill guy, so I would like to get to know him better. Also it may just be me, but I sensed a bit of sexual? romantic? tension the last time we spoke.

Also I have no clue what a good date would be. Should I take him out to get coffee/tea and then a walk (is kinda cold outside though)? Should I invite him over and cook/bake something for him (I can make a really good banana bread or cinnamon rolls)? 

I’m pretty sure he’s single. Should I ask to confirm before I ask him out, just in case?

We humans may also have this ability.,"From the book Unearthly Disclosure by British UFO researcher Timothy Good:

Another case involving a trip to an alleged alien base is recounted by Jorge Martín. In 1980 Iván Rivera Morales, a Puerto Rican police officer, lay bed- ridden with rheumatic fever. Racked with pain and unable to move, he prayed for a cure. **Some nights later, the room filled with golden spheres of light**. A voice in his head told him not to be afraid, **and the spheres materialized into two four-foot-high beings – the typical ‘greys’**. Suddenly, as in the case of Carl Higdon (Chapter 15), Morales found himself inside a bizarre, transparent contraption, standing up beside the beings, who placed a helmet on his head, supposedly to facilitate communication.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

From the book Unearthly Disclosure by British UFO researcher Timothy Good:

In Chapter 1, I refer in part to the story of Inocencia Cataquet, who claims to have encountered undersea alien craft in Puerto Rico in 1988. Cataquet told Jorge Martín that he subseqently communicated with human-type aliens who, as in the case of Iván Rivera Morales (Chapter 17), **seemed to ‘materialize’ out of balls of light. They explained to Cataquet that they were capable of travelling among dimensions.** Impending ‘geological changes’ will endanger all life on Earth, they declared, necessitating their taking and preserving the genetics of all species – including humankind – with which to repopulate Earth in the event of global catastrophe. Other alien beings, they said, were conducting similar work, although their intentions toward us were not good

In 1977, Bernardo Vega of Ensenada, Puerto Rico was undergoing treatment for chronic cardiac problems at the local Hospital Oncologico De Ponce. On the evening of December 22, 1977, Vega was at his home caring for his wife, who was feeling ill and had been vomiting all night due to a flu-like illness.

(snip)

Vega decided to go outside to the terrace and clean out the bowl his wife had been using. As he washed the bowl, **he saw three bright lights approaching**. He first thought they were fireflies until they grew close and he saw that they were large and bright. He fell to his knees and watched in fear **as the lights descended onto the terrace right in front of him and transformed into three men.**

They were ""not ugly or pretty,"" said Vega. They were three feet tall, with short arms and legs and large hands. Their faces were large, with a big flat nose, thick lips and luminous eyes. They each wore blue divers' suits.

They began to speak at high-speed in an unknown language. Vega looked into their glowing eyes. The little men stared back, seeming to ""penetrate"" his mind.

(SNIP)

Vega replied that he would tell her later. The three men then held each other's hands, and told Vega, ""We need you. Goodbye."" **The men transformed back into three orbs of light and flew away.** Vega says that the entire event lasted about twenty-five minutes.

From the book Sky People - Untold Stories of Alien Encounters in Mesoamerica by Dr. Ardy Sixkiller Clarke, PhD (the author interviewed many indigenous people in South America who saw UFOs and aliens near their villages):

“Hugo, have you ever seen aliens or spaceships at this site?” I asked.

“I have seen spaceships many times. It does not matter; they come during the day and night. They never come when there are tourists. Personally, I have never seen an alien or a Sky God, or whatever you choose to call them, but the men \[workers\] tell me they frequently land their ships near the Acropolis and get out and walk around. They say they hear their chanting at night.” 

“Do they ever describe what they look like?” I asked.

**“Sometimes they come as balls of light and turn into men that look just like them. Other times they look like people but are not people.”**

“Can you explain?”

“They never really talk about it. They are too afraid, but although they have the form of a man, they are not men. That is all I know.”

(SNIP)

“Tell me about the Star People who live among us.” 

(SNIP)

“What do they look like?” I asked.

“Like you and me. They can look like anyone they like. On this planet they look human. On another they look like the dominant species.”

“Why do you call them the Shining People?” I asked.

**“In their true state, they are balls of light.** It is only when they assume human form that you see them. Otherwise you are blinded by them. **Many people never know they have met them. They see balls of light, not realizing that they are actually living forms.”**

(SNIP)

“The year was 1982. I was thirteen years old. I lived in the same village as Mateo. It was July—July 15, to be exact. I remember because it was my birthday.

(snip)

The priest nodded.

“I woke up in the middle of the night. **I saw flashing lights outside**. It was very strange to me. We didn’t have electricity in our village, so I had only seen electric lights a time or two. I could even see them flashing with my eyes closed. At first I  was very excited. I had never seen anything of such beauty. I tried to wake up my three brothers who slept in the same room with me. They would not awaken no matter how hard I tried.”

“Tell her about me,” Mateo said. 

“In time, dear friend. I am trying to tell as it happened. I remember being told, in my mind, to go out the bedroom window. I did as I was told and crawled out the window. **Once outside I saw these colorful balls of light. Some were still in the sky but some were on the ground and when they hit the earth they transformed into men.** 

(SNIP)

“What time was it?” 

“Late in the evening. Before dark, but all the tourists were gone. I found myself over a mile from the entrance when the sky became dark and a lightning storm came up. Taking cover in one of the structures, I decided to wait out the storm. It lasted much longer than I expected. Darkness came and I was still inside the ruins. As the rain eased, I decided to head home. **That’s when a circular craft came out of the clouds and settled in the plaza. Three men, covered in light, came out of the craft. They stopped in front of the Temple of Inscriptions and turned themselves into balls of light.** I watched as they floated upward to the top of the entrance and then they disappeared.” He paused for a moment and lit a cigarette. “I ran across the plaza, keeping to the edges and out of sight. Before leaving the plaza, I looked back, but the craft was still there. As I walked down the hill toward the town, I saw the craft move above the trees and head south, and then in a second it was gone.”

“I have seen the lights many times,” Vincente said. Everyone turned in the direction of an elder who sat at the end of the table. Pax had introduced him to me earlier as one of his closest friends. They could have passed for brothers. “Anyone who has spent time outside at night has seen the lights. Sometimes they come from a craft; sometimes they just appear. **I have seen the Sky People turn into balls of light in front of my eyes. I have also seen them disappear. They have great powers.** I always try to stay away from them. They are dangerous.”

“Please, tell me about Adan.”

“He was sixteen the night they took him. Almost a man.”

“Who took him?”

“I’m not sure. I woke in the middle of the night and woke up Gabriella. **I saw three balls of light in the backyard.** On the way out of the house, we woke up Adan, and he followed us. We stood on the porch and watched them for several minutes.” She paused and sipped her coffee, added sugar to it, and stirred.

“You said you saw lights.”

**“Yes. By that time they had become these tall beings. Not quite human, but human-looking.** 

(SNIP)

“Can you describe the silhouette you saw that night?” I asked.

“I could make out a circular shadow. It cast a blue light upon the ground. **There were three balls of light that came out of it. They materialized into human-like figures.** That is what I remember. Gabriella remembers the blue light and the balls of light, but nothing else. I know what I saw. My brother was abducted.”

beans. Salvador filled a tortilla and passed the plate to me. I passed the plate to Auturo. We ate and drank orange juice in silence. Salvador ate another plateful of tortillas before he spoke again. “It was later that night. I fell asleep. **A bright light woke me**. The room was like a full sun had come up, but that was not true. **Five balls of light circled my hammock.** They slowly went up and down my body. One centered over my head and stayed there.” He pointed to his forehead. “It was warm and felt good. The others centered on my chest, which became very warm. Suddenly I could breathe. I sat up and the balls of light went out the door. I followed them and just as they reached the backyard, I saw them. **Five men came out of the balls of light.** They stopped and looked at me. I saw a beam of light come from the trees above, and they disappeared upward into the light. I watched as the V-shaped machine moved upward. Red lights outlined it. It climbed into the sky and then it was gone.”

From 1968 HUMANOID SIGHTING REPORTS Compiled by Albert Rosales:

Date: 1968

Time: late night

The 5-year old witness (involved in other encounters) was lying down on his bed **when a ball of light came into the bedroom.** It was bluish in color, violet. And it was very bright, but the light did not hurt his eyes. **This light transformed into a woman**. She was about 2.20m in height, the witness was just a small child so it was difficult for him to ascertain her exact size, but she was very tall. She had raid hair and her eyes were green, but water green, transparent green, very strange eyes. She had very white skin and her lips were pin, perfect, her features were perfect. He remembers that she leaned over him and said, “Don’t worry”. He heard that inside his brain (telepathy). “Don’t worry everything is going to be OK.” Then he found himself inside a room with a metallic bed and there was a bubble around him, like a soup bubble, transparent. And the same woman was outside the bubble looking at him. She was “talking” to him, telling him that they were going to put something in him.

From 1969 HUMANOID SIGHTING REPORTS Compiled by Albert Rosales:

Location. Mt. View, California

Date: 1969

Time: late night

One night a hum and a thumping sound in her bedroom awakened the witness. **On opening her eyes she saw very bright balls of light in the corridor at the entrance to her bedroom**. The light was so bright that there were no shadows and her surroundings were almost bleached white. Remarkably her eyes, adjusted instantaneously. **As the balls of light disappeared a loud electrical popping sound was heard and three dark gray figures appeared in their place.** One of the gray figures stood out as the leader and has remained an integral part of the witness experiences. She was then taken onboard a craft and was immediately escorted and placed into a chamber where her physical body was subjected to a vibration that increased in intensity until it felt like every molecule in her body exploded.

Evidence that humans also have the ability to turn into orbs of light:

From the Betty Andreasson UFO abductions in the 1960s and 70s:

In 1978, Betty and Bob heard a whirring sound above their house. Concurrently, both were lifted out of their bodies and, along with others, entered a huge round amphitheater-like enclosure. They were greeted by tall, robed human-looking entities. They found themselves on a high walkway that surrounded the enclosure. Bob was separated from Betty. He was told that he was not as spiritually advanced as Betty and was held to wait for her. During that time **he received answers to many questions that he asked an alien who guarded him**. **Betty, on the other hand, was allowed to participate with a number of light beings in a fantastic procedure that changed her and them into balls of light and back to their light- being form.** During this abduction, Betty glanced down to the floor below and gasped. She saw two daughters and Bob’s daughter on tables being examined by aliens. She was so troubled by what she saw that the hypnotist had her temporarily forget what she saw. They were returned to their bodies and had no idea of what had just happened to them.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

From the book The Holographic Universe by Michael Talbot: 

Another strikingly holographic feature of the OBE is the plasticity of the form a person assumes once they are out of the body. **After detaching from the physical, OBEers sometimes find themselves in a ghostlike body that is an exact replica of their biological body**. This caused some researchers in the past to postulate that human beings possess a ""phantom double"" not unlike the doppelganger of literature. However, recent findings have exposed problems with this assumption. Although some OBEers describe this phantom double as naked, others find themselves in bodies that are fully clothed. **This suggests that the phantom double is not a permanent energy replica of the biological body, but is instead a kind of hologram that can assume many shapes.** This notion is borne out by the fact that phantom doubles are not the only forms people find themselves in during OBEs. **There are numerous reports where people have also perceived them- selves as balls of light**, shapeless clouds of energy, and even no discernible form at all.

(SNIP)

In addition to those mentioned by Ring and Fenske, the NDE has numerous other features that are markedly holographic. ,Like OBEers, after **NDEers have detached from the physical they find themselves in one of two forms, either as a disembodied cloud of energy, or as a hologramlike body sculpted by thought.** When the latter is the case, the mind-created nature of the body is often surprisingly obvious to the NDEer. **For example, one near-death survivor says that when he first emerged from his body he looked ""something like a jellyfish""** and fell lightly to the floor like a soap bubble. Then he quickly expanded into a ghostly three-dimensional image of a naked man. However, the presence of two women in the room embarrassed him and to his surprise, this feeling caused him suddenly to become clothed (the women, however, never offered any indication that they were able to see any of this).

(SNIP)

These hologramlike bodies can be remarkably detailed. In the incident involving the man who became embarrassed at his own naked- ness, for example, the clothing he materialized for himself was so meticulously wrought that he could even make out the seams in the material!41 **Similarly, another man who studied his hands while in the ND state said they were ""composed of light with tiny structures in them"" and when he looked closely he could even see ""the delicate whorls of his fingerprints and tubes of light up his arms.""**

1h1act2,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/1h1act2/my_flatmates_are_bullies/,My flatmates are bullies. ,"Hi! I (18f) recently moved to uni, l've been put in a flat with 4 other girls who i got along with for the first month. Me and one of my flatmates (18f, we'll call her K) hosted an after party in our flat one night, we made sure to check with our other flatmates who gave us the OK and they didn't have lectures at all the next day. The day after, 2 of them are acting really weird with us (We'll call them F and D) We didn't think much of it until they started being really passive aggressive, leaving notes around the place, such as a note on the microwave (me and K have used it like twice between us since getting there)
'this is a mess, clean it. Luckily, me and K aren't the type of people to give one about petty stuff like that, however our 5th flatmate, W, isn't quite sensitive and really took this to heart, W had her boyfriend over for a couple days and the walls are thin in uni accom guys, but everyone knows that The next day there were multiple messages on our fridge whiteboard from F and D saying really nasty stuff (for context, W is a bigger girl, however she is extremely gorgeous) They had written stuff like 'we can hear you doing it, maybe lose a few and you'd be quieter' All of this made W leave uni for 2 weeks to go home as she couldn't handle them. We decided to just try and ignore the 2 girls as much as we could bc we didn't want to give them any idea that they were bothering us in hopes they would eventually stop. Me and K do a reasonable clean of the kitchen about once a week, so bins get taken out, sides are wiped and things are put away. We are the only ones who do this. Before me and K left for our reading week, we didn't have time to do a kitchen clean so just left it how it was, however, the day after we both got home, D had posted a tikok basically saying that she hates her flatmates bc the kitchen was always a mess The mess she was describing was a few crumbs on the counters and a couple tissues that i had been using to wipe stuff down and completely forgot about. They've made it abundantly clear they don't like us, but as someone with mental health issues, it's really been taking a toll and i know that if they keep pushing us then im going to lash out at them and then i will be painted as the bad guy. I'm not an angry person but im just feeling very very hurt We have talked to them about this before, saying that if they have something on their minds or they have a problem with something that we are doing then they need to speak to us so that we can make things right. Obviously this went in one ear and out the other.
Also, when i came back from reading week, they’d thrown out mine and K’s sponges as well as completely reorganised our cupboards without our permission and basically removed anything that isn’t there’s out of the kitchen and left it at our doors. 
This wouldn’t be a problem, however i brought quite an expensive coffee machine with me (it’s not allowed to go in our rooms) and when i went to turn it on, they’d completely broken it. the steam wand didn’t work and the bean grinder was dull, i don’t know what they’ve done to it, but when i confronted them, they’d completely broken lied to me and said they didn’t even touch it, however they posted a tiktok where you can see that it was not in its original place. 
I have a house secured for next year but i genuinely don’t know if i can stand it here for much longer. ",2,1732730054.0,UniUK,3,0.67,False

1h1a7lb,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1h1a7lb/scales_chapter_1/,Scales chapter 1,"The Three Kings




“In a realm divided by vast and enchanting landscapes, three kings presided over their respective domains. The kingdoms were known as Oceanian, an underwater realm teeming with mermaids and vibrant marine life; Solaris, the fiery kingdom that cradled the dragon's lair in the north and charming villages in the south; and Lunaris, the kingdom bathed in moonlight, where enigmatic creatures were said to wander.




Long before these sovereigns donned their crowns, a decision had been made to maintain the separation of their peoples. Each king, devoted to the welfare of his own kingdom, enacted laws that, while well-intentioned, often overlooked the repercussions they might have on the others. As a result, the delicate balance of Oceanian began to falter. The waters, once a sanctuary, grew perilous as the land kingdoms of Solaris and Lunaris overfished the seas and ravaged the coral reefs.




Tragedy struck when a member of Oceanian was discovered, a spear cruelly embedded in their body, left to perish in the depths. In response to this grievous act, the king of Oceanian summoned the first-ever assembly of the three rulers. With a heavy heart, he implored his fellow kings to unite in safeguarding their realms.




The King of Solaris, recognizing the urgency of the situation, was receptive to collaboration. However, the King of Lunaris remained obstinate, unwilling to entertain any interference in his governance. He harbored suspicions that the other two kings conspired against him, seeking to encroach upon his territory. Unable to sway him, the two kings watched as Lunaris departed, vowing to retaliate against what he perceived as an affront.




Undeterred, the kings of Oceanian and Solaris forged a pact. They agreed to respect each other's sovereignty while the King of Oceanian would send young scholars to Solaris, fostering an exchange of knowledge that both believed was essential for their survival. Thus, The Exchange was born.




From that day forth, each year, the King of Oceanian would bring a group of young students to the surface, granting them the extraordinary opportunity to dwell on land temporarily. These students were welcomed into the homes of local Solarians, where they lived and learned together, forging bonds that transcended their differences. The Exchange became a cherished tradition, celebrated by the inhabitants of both kingdoms.




Yet, the success of this initiative only deepened the paranoia of the King of Lunaris. He continued to issue threats against both kingdoms, convinced that their unity posed a threat to his reign. Thus, the delicate tapestry of their world remained fraught with tension, as the three kings navigated the complexities  of their intertwined fates.”




Fawn places the worn book back in its place on the shelf. In her childhood her father had read  to her “The Three Kings” so many times she was surprised the book still held together. She used to imagine the beautiful, colorful underwater kingdom and wished she could visit it. Now she was 19 and even though she still liked to get lost in the fantasy lands of her books she recognized them for what they were, tales to teach about right and wrong, good and bad, love and light. She knew the Great War that happened 20 years ago was real  but she was now a little old to believe the children’s tale. There had been 20 years of peace since King Hyland of Lunaris attacked the  kingdom of Solaria. They were safe now.




Outside, Fawn’s parents sat together on the swing overlooking the ocean cliff. It was a cloudy, misty day. A breeze was blowing the high grasses but the ocean was calm. Fawn could smell the salt air from her room. Her parents were always together like this. They never missed an opportunity to sit together, just the two of them. They were loving parents, and the three of them, plus their cat Percy, completed their family. 




“Time for some breakfast Perce.” she sighs as she lets the fluffy orange cat out into the kitchen. The smell of fresh baked bread and coffee fill her head. The fairies have outdone themselves again. Her favorite cinnamon bread as well as eggs and an assortment of meats and cheeses is already set out for the family, and a bowl of cream for Percy.  Although the fairies who provide for the family are never seen, they always make sure the family’s every need is anticipated. She is sure they know today is a special day. 




Today the young merfolk that come to the surface every summer are returning and with them Asher, Fawns best, and only friend. He has come to the surface every summer since he was a child as a part of The Exchange.  Her own mother had once been one of the merfolk to come and visit. She then fell in love with her father and somehow convinced Fawn’s grandfather, the king of Oceanian, to grant her permission to live permanently in Solara. The underwater king’s magic is the only of its kind allowing the merfolk to live on land. 




Her mother taught her alot about  Oceanian. How it was a peaceful kingdom full of the most interesting people, the beautiful places she saw on adventures with her three older sisters. Being a half mermaid, Fawn could swim underwater much longer than most. Her legs transformed to a beautiful tail of gold when she entered deep enough water. The transformation lasted long enough for her to explore the lagoon by her home often enough but she had never ventured where she could see any of the things her mother had described to her. Fawn also inherited her scale markings from her mother. The gold scales that adorn the sides of her face match her tail. There would be no doubt to anyone that she is part mermaid. Her coloring though she got from her father, her golden skin and blond hair with red highlights. 




Asher and her mother often bonded over their similar upbringings underwater. Scarlet, being a princess, grew up with Asher’s father, a member of the court. This year marked Asher’s last year coming to the surface. He was turning 20 and would soon be assigned a station in Oceanian. Fawn isnt sure they will ever see each other again and she wants to make the most of their last summer together. 




“Is that coffee I smell?” Fawn’s mother sings as she walks with her father in the back door that leads right to the kitchen. “As long as I live here I will never get used to this.” she says as she picks up the carafe and pours herself a cup. 

“I remember when Roman and I first told you about the fairies, you didn’t believe us for weeks. Thought we were trying to bamboozle you.” Fawn’s father jokes. 

“Well what would you have thought? You said yourself you have never seen one and even though Roman is king of these lands he never missed an opportunity to tease me.” 

Fawn’s father gave her mother a mischievous wink.




The magic of the realm is mysterious. It is connected to the land. As long as the land is healthy the magic thrives. The magic in Solaria and Oceanian is plentiful. The abundance of fairies and the Dragon’s Nest in the north of Solaria are proof of this. This is the main reason King Hylan wants land in Solaria. His kingdom of Lunaris has been depleted of magic.  King Hylan has used his reign to pull magic from the land and use it for himself. The subjects of Lunaris are known to be ruthless monsters. It is rumored that the lack of magic has transformed them into creatures with wings and teeth and claws. Fawn’s father does not believe this though. He has taught Fawn of the tribes of people who are native to Lunaris. 




“That reminds me, Everett”, Fawn’s mother says as she pushes her bright red hair off her shoulders. “Yesterday when I was at the market I ran into the Blackstone’s. They asked if you would escort Asher to their place when he arrives. They will be out for the afternoon and with sightings of the Sylvangaurd they want to make sure he gets there safely.” 

Fawn’s father scowls. 

“What’s wrong? I didn’t think that would be a problem. I already told them you would be happy to escort him home.”

“Not that, of course I will escort Asher to the Blackstone’s. I am just wondering why you were at the market yesterday and didn’t get me any toffees. I ran out over a week ago.”

“Oh you are too much.” Fawn’s mother says while swatting at her father. 

“I’ll believe the Sylvangaurd is here when I see them with my own eyes.” her father says his light blue eyes narrowing suspiciously. “Roman just wouldn’t allow that to happen.”

“There have been many sightings, father. They are hard creatures to mistake with their black and gold feathered wings.”

The Sylvangaurd resides in Lunaris under King Hylan’s rule. In the Great War they fought against Solaris. Their sightings have caused much fear throughout the kingdom in recent weeks. 



“Fawn, after breakfast lets get some of your studies out of the way so that once your grandfather arrives you will have the rest of your day to yourself.” her father says. 

“ Yes, actually with the sightings of the Sylvanguard I have been doing a lot of rereading about Lunaris and I have some questions for you.” Fawn replies. 



After breakfast Fawn met her father in the study. Everett loved history and he was very passionate about teaching Fawn about all of the lands and people of the realm. Fawn shared her father’s appreciation for the different ways the people lived and used their lands resources to thrive. Fawn picked up the notes she had with questions for her father after her readings. 

“Father, are the Sylvangaurd the only remaining native tribe of Lunaris? Or are they just the only tribe that fought for Lunaris in the war?” she asked.

“Well, no one is really sure.” he answered running his hands through his blond/red hair. “The other tribes haven’t been seen. Many were turned into creatures by King Hyland. The Dendrons for example who lived mostly in the treetops were turned to mindless creatures. They were very skilled at archery and when they were turned used those talents against us. Solaria lost a lot of great soldiers to their arrows, but they didn’t know what they were doing. Their eyes had turned a milky white and they would look right through you. The destruction of their tribe is a great loss to Lunaris. They were a peaceful people who were very connected with nature and animals. They could speak with birds you know.” 

“How did they survive living in the trees?”

“They lived in tree houses and had built a series of interconnected rope bridges to take them from place to place. Roman and I saw one once, when we were children, before they were turned, on our visit to Lunaris. They were very tall and thin with the kindest eyes, like they could look at you and know you. They could climb the tallest tree in the blink of an eye. Amazing people.” her father answered. “Such a shame to see them years later, mindless and crazed.” her father said solemnly. 

“Then there is the Frostborn. They lived closest to King Hylan’s castle so I wouldn’t be surprised if they really were all gone. They lived in the colder regions in the mountains. They were fierce, I suppose you had to be to live in their climate, but they were also a peaceful race before they were turned.”

“Did you meet one when you were in Lunaris as well?” Fawn asked.

“No. Their climate wasn’t exactly conducive for King Roman, or Prince Roman back then. Had he known what was to come he may have though. Now he wouldn’t even know where to look for them. Hiding in the mountains they would never be found if they didn’t want to be. That is enough for today though, leave me the rest of your questions and I’ll take a look at them, I believe your mother is waiting for you in the garden.”



The only thing Fawn loved more than learning about the realm with her father was working in the garden with her mother. They had created quite an impressive array of herbs, vegetables, fruits and flowers. Fawn knew every plant that grew in Solaria. She also studied the ones only found in Oceanian and Lunaris. She longed to see the ones that didn’t thrive in Solaria’s sun and heat, although she was able to get some dried plants from Oceanian thanks to her grandfather. She knew he would have a package for her when he arrived with the Exchange today. 



“Hi sweetie!” Fawn’s mother called, brushing sweat off her forehead with the back of her gloved hand. Her bright green eyes sparkled in the sunshine. Her skirt was covered in soil, and she looked vibrant. Fawn always thought her mother seemed the happiest when she was working in their garden. “I’ve watered the Foxglove already could you harvest the Belladonna?” 

Many of the plants in the garden had multiple uses. Fawn and her mother would create creams and tinctures which they sold to a shopkeeper at the market. There were also some not so common uses for many of the plants and they created those orders at special request. Fawn had asked her mother when she was younger why she did this. She explained that the women of Solaris needed to feel safe and her presence in the market as an option helped to create that. Fawn couldn’t imagine using any of those special tinctures but figured someone must be left desperate to resort to needing them and continued to help her mother. 

“Are you excited for today?” her mother asked. “Oh I am so excited to see grandfather!” Fawn answered.

“Just grandfather? No one else?” 

Fawn stopped picking the Belladonna berries to look up at her mother. “What do you mean? she asked, her cheeks starting to heat. 

“What I mean, daughter, is that Asher will be back for his last season with us. Are you also excited to see him?”

“I wouldn’t say excited, but I am happy to see him again.” She answered shyly. 

“Is that all? Just happy to see him? I would have thought after that kiss last year you would be quite a bit more than happy he is coming back.” Her mother prodded. 

“What? How did you? I don’t know what you mean.” Fawn’s faced flushed as she went back to picking the berries. She wasn’t sure how her mother had known about the kiss Asher and her shared last season. She hadn’t told anyone, and it was just her and Asher that night in the garden. 

“The Foxglove!” she exclaimed. “It was the Foxglove that told you wasn’t it?” she asked as her mother laughed. “That silly plant, has it got nothing better to do than to gossip about me?” 

“You try never leaving this one patch of land. I assure you it was the most interesting thing to happen near it in years.” her mother explained. 

Her mother had more than just a way with plants. They “spoke” with her. Fawn didn’t quite understand it but they plants could tell her what they needed or how to make certain concoctions with them. Some, though, had their own interests to talk about and apparently Fawn was one of those interests. 

“But forget the plants. Why didn’t you tell me? Asher is a nice boy and it’s only natural you would have feelings for each other. You have been friends almost your entire lives. Your father and I were much more than friends at 19 I assure you there is nothing to be embarrassed of dear.”

“You and father, or your and the king?” Fawn asked and regretting the words as soon as they left her tongue. 

“Yes, well that is quite the question, isn’t it?” Her mother answered going back to her watering. 

There had always been a bit of mystery with the relationship between Scarlet, Fawn’s mother, her father, and King Roman. All three had been friends at one time. The rumor was that Scarlett and the King were in love but that her mother left the king for father, the kings best friend. Fawn assumed this was the real reason they no longer spoke but her parents would never talk to her about it. Fawn wanted to apologize to her mother for the way she spoke but just then the clouds seem to part and sunlight spread over the entire garden. Fawn looked up to see the ocean sparkle. 



“Grandfather!” She runs outside down the rocky hills to the lagoon, the saltwater air making her hair stick to her face, her skirts picking up sand along the hem. As she gets to the shore she sees her grandfather. King Ormand, surrounded by young merfolk. As the young merpeople make their way out of the water their shimmering tails of every color turn to legs. The king’s magic also providing fashionable clothing. They would mix right in with any of Solaris’s citizens. She spots Asher right away. He towers over everyone but the king. She runs into the water to her grandfather and throws her arms around him. 

“Fawn, my dearest! I have missed you.” he says, wrapping his arms around her as well. 

Fawn breathes in her grandfather's familiar scent. Seaweed, lilies, and tobacco, just how she remembers. “You are so much taller, and a beauty just like your mother.” he says as he looks up and gives a wave to Fawn’s mother and father on the shore. 

“Oh, I almost forgot. I have a gift for you.” The king hands Fawn a wooden box. It is intricately carved with markings she has never seen before. It's beautiful, definitely crafted by a skilled citizen of Oceanian. 

“What is it, grandfather?” she asks. 

“Well, I don’t actually know.” he tells her. “It was found in one of the deepest parts of the ocean. No one has been able to open it. I thought maybe the two of you could see what you can figure out with your last summer together.”

“I’m always up for an adventure.” Asher says from behind Fawn. 

She turns and smiles at him. He picks her up and spins her around into a hug. Her skirts wet from the ocean spraying water around. 

“It’s so good to see you.” Fawn says to him when he finally puts her down. “You have grown 4 inches!”

“Just two.” he says back. 

“Well, I will leave you two to your summer.” The king places a kiss on Fawn’s fareheard and dives back into the water. 

Asher grabs Fawns hand and walks her out of the water onto the shore where her parents are waiting. 

“Asher, my boy, it’s good to see you.” Fawn’s father says with a hand on Asher’s shoulder. 

“How are your parents dear?” her mother asks. 

“Everyone is well. It is nice to see you all again.” Asher responds. 

“Have you received your court assignment yet, any idea where you will be stationed?” Her father asks. 

“Not yet, but I am hoping to be stationed in the North Sea where my brother is.”

The North Sea is leagues away from the coast where the cottage sits. Fawn tries not to let the disappointment show on her face. 

As they reach the cottage Scarlet asks Asher “Would you like to come in for some breakfast.”

“I would love to, but the Blackstone's might worry. I would hate to keep them waiting on me. Thank you for the offer.”

“That reminds me, I will be escorting you, some interesting things have been going on lately. I’ll fill you in on the way.” her father says to Asher.

Asher takes Fawn's hands into his.

“Fawn, I have so much to tell you. I really do have to get to the Blackstone's though. Can we meet up in the morning?”

“Of course. You know where to find me.” Fawn says blushing from all of his attention set only on her. “I'll see what I can find out about this box. Maybe we will have a lead by morning.”

“If anyone can, it's you. I will see you tomorrow then.” Asher kisses her forehead and walks away through the high grasses toward the hill with Fawn’s father to the city. Fawn watches until she can no longer see him past the hill. 

That afternoon and evening Fawn pours over some of her mother's old school books trying to decipher the markings on the box. Despite her best efforts she has not been able to translate even one of the markings. 

Just then there is a soft knock on Fawn's bedroom door. Her mother walks in with a tray of tea and biscuits Percy following closely behind. “I thought a little snack might be in order.” She sits the tray down on the desk. “Would you mind me taking a look? I know it's been a long time since I studied in Oceanian but maybe I could be of some help?

“Please. I haven’t found anything.” Fawn says, sliding the box over to her mother. 

Scarlet takes a few minutes reviewing the markings on the box.

“Do you see this mark? It is the mark of Tyra. That is a reference to an area of the sea back when it was divided into territories and not just one kingdom. There was much fighting among the lords of each territory back then. The territory Lord Tyra ruled is an area of Oceanian just off the coast of Solara, by the castle.  This box must be very old. The kingdom was formed over 200 years ago.”

Fawn had never been to the castle but she often pretended, when she was younger, of attending a ball there. Twirling around in a fancy dress, eating the most amazing foods and making conversation with interesting people. She knew both her mother and father had grown up there with the King but they had not been back. 

That night Fawn dreamed she was swimming in waters so dark she could barely see where she was going. It wasn't a frightening dream, she felt as if she was gliding, being steered by something or someone else who knew exactly where they were going.

I have a 7 week old son who is nowhere near mobile, but the time is fast approaching where I will not be able to leave my gun(s) around on a coffee table or night stand.

I am looking for methods of storing that are secure, but very accessible. I'm not a fan of the idea of unloading and/or storing ammo separately.

I like the idea of something like stop box that's not electronic and doesn't need a key, but I was wondering if there where better or cheaper alternatives.

I thought I would consult the experts of reddit!

1h1a60h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h1a60h,Help. We suck at colors.,"So we've got this tiny, awkwardly-shaped room that I'm turning into a makeshift ""game/VR"" room. We just bought that tiny sofa because it pulls out into a full size sleeper, and critically was narrow enough that we can fit TWO sim racing rigs next to each other there (only one pictured). The TV will also be staying. Everything else is going to go. There will be a small coffee table for the couch, but that will be movable as I want the rest of the space open for VR stuff. I'm open to the idea of shelves where the black Ikea shelf is shoehorned in for now, or just in that whole end of the room on both sides of the door since I'll need storage for game room related things. I actually like the new Ikea style cabinets so adding those for reference.

So now that you know the general idea for the layout... I have NO idea what color to paint this room. We painted it white when we moved in because it was a hideous 80's color. Originally I was just going to paint an accent wall behind the couch, but I'm trying to get away from the whole house being white and open to painting the room fully. However I'm an engineer, not an interior decorator, and suck at choosing colors. Open to suggestions. Being a car guy my immediate thought is the game room should be dramatic and be themed like the Gulf livery, or the Lotus colors, but I also don't want it to look stupid, so probably best to just paint good, normal house colors and then decorate it accordingly.

The rest of the house is very mid-century modern even though it doesn't look like it from these photos because the previous owners ruined a lot of it... in case that helps with suggestions. Any guidance would be much appreciated! Not only for the wall colors but for the trim/doors/window color too.",1,1732729580.0,HomeDecorating,0,1.0,False

What a month it’s been! _Halo 2_ turned twenty, the E3 2003 demo saw a release from the Digsite team, _Halo Infinite_'s Winter Update brought a new weapon to the sandbox—and that’s just the start. (We haven’t even gotten to being able to make _Halo_ -themed racetracks in Forza Horizon 5 yet!)

Let’s get you up to speed on all the latest news.

##  **20 YEARS OF HALO 2**

[ **OPERATION: GREAT JOURNEY**](https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/great-journey-operation-launch) ****

Operation: Great Journey is still live in _Halo Infinite_ and kicked off the 2024 Winter Update.

This Operation brought the Thremaleon armor as part of its free 20-tier Operation Pass, inspired by Rtas “Half-Jaw” ‘Vadum, with the Veteran SRS99 weapon model and Damascus Alchemy weapon coating available as part of the Premium Pass.

The MA5K Avenger has entered _Halo Infinite_'s sandbox and by now you’ve no doubt managed to get to grips with this new SMG-class weapon, particularly if you’ve been spending time in the Third-Person Firefight and Delta Arena playlists—and if you’ve yet to venture into those, you’re in for a good time with a fun new way to play _Halo_ in the former and legacy movement on some iconic maps in the latter.

##  **THE ARTIST’S CORNER**

In-keeping with the _Halo 2_ birthday celebrations, this month’s art piece is the cover art for the instruction manual of the _Halo 2 Multiplayer Map Pack_.

Originally released in July 2005, the _Halo 2 Multiplayer Map Pack_ was a physical product which contained updates, maps, and additional bonus features for _Halo 2_ such as the “Another Day at the Beach” cinematic, the Killtacular documentary detailing the making of the nine new maps, and more.

Those nine new maps were Containment, Warlock, Sanctuary, Turf, Backwash, Elongation, Gemini, Relic, and Terminal— _many_ names that you will undoubtedly recognize for their iconic place in _Halo_'s multiplayer legacy.

That concludes this issue of the Community Update, leaving just one more month to go before we say goodbye to 2024.

See you in December!

I've decided to dip my toes into the world of Nespresso by getting a used machine on Marketplace to start with.  Ugh, I have resisted this for SO long -- I really don't want to support Nestle. BUT the coffee taste the way I want my coffee to taste, I've experimented with making my own coffee in 100 different ways and I just can't get it how I like it. So, I figure at least if I'm buying 2nd hand I'm doing something slightly more environmentally friendly.  (And I'm pleased to hear the pods are recyclable.)        
  
There are a LOT of machines to choose from on Marketplace.  I'm avoiding Pop and Next models due to the overwhelmingly bad reviews here and everywhere.    I realize I'm taking a chance with an older machine that may not have a long lifespan -- but I'd rather spend $45 - $60 to try it out than diving in with a new model for triple that price.  
  
Here are the ones I'm considering on my local Marketplace, I'd love to hear your thoughts:  
  
\* Virtuo Plus (dusty, it's been sitting in someone's basement)  
\* VirtuoLine Type GCA1 (white round top -- is this older?)  
\* Virtuo Deluxe Flat Head  (Looks maybe a couple years old but seller says lightly used)

As the rents in the city are so high, she is sharing a rental portion with a man (43M) and his daughter (19F), and the man's wife is living away from him with his other daughter. Both my wife, the man, and his daughter are staying in the same house. My wife visits me once or twice every month. I don't visit her, as it would be annoying for the man or his daughter if I visited their house often. My wife promised me she would return home after another year (she expects a transfer again). 

I was confident in my wife, and I was sure that she would never cheat me, but I have been upset for the past 10–12 days. She posted some pictures with that man on Instagram: together they have visited theme parks and coffee shops; in the caption she was calling him 'Bestie' and 'Dear'. In a photo, the man was standing very close to my wife, holding her shoulder, and I wasn't happy with that. I called her one day and asked about these posts. She said he is her best friend, and she became furious and thought I was doubting. Evening after that, one day, I saw the Instagram story of the man, whereby my wife and him were holding hands. I wasn't able to sleep that night. I know about my wife; she would not have had an affair, but she is growing closer with the man.

I thought to visit her and went to her house and opened the door. I saw an incident that further made me disappointed. I heard them laughing and giggling. The man and my wife were rolling, pulling, and pushing each other and were fighting for a TV remote.As soon as they saw me, they got up, and my wife hugged me.

Good ol’ Cream of Chicken and Wild Rice with or without the bread bowl.

Good ol’ you pick two buckaroo

Good ol’ NAPA ALMOND CHICKEN SANDWICH!

Good ol’ ASIAN SESEME SALAD

Good ol’ BEARCLAWWWWWW HOW DARE YOU!!!

And the nerve to replace it with a PECAN BRAID?! 

This is tantamount to when Starbucks removed giant rice krispie treats, mango smoothies, and their Valencia Orange refresher.

You see I am one of many men that don’t always go to places like Panera or Starbucks.

We don’t know what Frappuccino, Mochaccino, Ciabatta, or Asiago mean.

But we do eventually find something we like. And oh boy do we make it ours! And it makes us happy! And anytime we find ourselves in these places with avid coffee and cafe enthusiasts like our partners, friends, or family that know exactly what they want…we do too! 

For the first time in our simpleton lives we don’t have to shy away from the menu! We proudly state we want a bearclaw! We want a Napa Almond Chicken Sandwich! I’ll have the Valencia Orange Refresher! Ooooh I can feel it rolling off my tongue! 

And what do you do? You strip that away from us! Years of solitude amongst the ever changing world of the food and service industry.

Only to be cast out again into the darkness. The maddening ever lasting darkness that is Panera Bread now.

I literally walked into the store and there was nobody at the registers. Just some people in the back and some guy handing people to go order cause I guess people steal now.

I glance over at the bakery section to check out the bear claws and I was met with a dystopian level of hatred towards humanity.

No scones, no muffins, no bear claws, everything looked like the bakery section of a rural town’s grocery store on its last legs.

What the hell is going on here?

Panera used to be popping! 

Do you people not remember the early 2000s era of Borders, Barnes and Noble, Starbucks, and Panera? Where people would hang out, read, listen to music, chill, all while enjoying their favorite snacks and beverages?

This is bad.

Like really bad.

This to me shows me where we are as a society at this point. We are not doing well right now. Community, traditions, and overall vibes and atmosphere are STRUGGLING.

And it’s because of that one little thing like a Bear claw pastry.

You may not think it is, but it is. Take it from me.

I grew up with Borders, Starbucks, Panera, Seattle’s Best, all that stuff.

You come for food, but stay for the experience. And let me tell you, this is not an experience right now.

I think we need to take a step back from all of this modern, sleek, and minimalistic tones all these companies have going and get back to the little things.

Because this stuff affects the service, the food, the atmosphere, and worst of all the customers.

I would go through a ball pit down a slide and through some kindergartners throwing big macs at me and feel good about it over the sad excuse you call kiosk McDonalds nowadays.

1h19vtx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AltStreetBets/comments/1h19vtx/patience_is_key_kendu_inu_is_here_for_the_longterm/,"Patience is Key, Kendu Inu is here for the long-term.","It's been said from the start, Kendu Inu was created to be a multi cycle project. The price action that we are witnessing now for the project is crucial for creating a proper distribution of tokens so that long term growth is achievable. Consider it an opportunity of a lifetime to be able to enter a project as established and committed as Kendu at these levels. Here's a very brief look into the ecosystem if you are not familiar.

**Facts**

* We are the cusp of having 15K holders
* Kendu is almost 10 months old
* We rank top 10% in subreddit size
* We have an NFT platform that is still yet to be fully deployed
* Kendu is on ETH but will bridge to SOL (and most likely other chains such as BASE)
* Coinbase Wallet featured Kendu in their advertisement (every other coin featured in the same advert is now listed on Coinbase)
* We have Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu jewelry, Kendu merch, and much more.
* We have had several articles written about us in Shib Magazine
* Kendu Miazaki (dev of Kendu) is going to be speaking at Shibcon about Kendu
* We hit an ATH of 280M back in June before the bullrun even started
* We have the best organic community in the space, bar none

Why is all of this relevant? I'm sure many of you have seen Bitcoin rise to historic levels these past few weeks, which according to past cycles, marks the start of the ""bullrun"". Right now, it is likely that we will see Bitcoin continue to rise above 100K and dominate the crypto market. Once Bitcoin dominance falls off, we will then see the true Altcoin season begin and with how things have turned out, it's highly likely this bullrun will be massive.

We are still in the prestages of a full fledged parabolic memecoin season and now is the perfect time to enter projects like Kendu who have firmly established themselves in the space and are entering the late stages of a major retracement phase. Now is not the time to chase green candles, it's the time to accumulate dips and get in on established projects BEFORE they explode; that is if you want to make actual life-changing money this bullrun.

There is a rising figure in the crypto space that goes by MustStopMurad and I feel what he says will ring even more true when this cycle ends.

""You are NOT investing in Memes. You are investing in PEOPLE. The Key is to find Communities that have:  
\- Inspired people hustling daily  
\- 6+ months old  
\- Survived multiple large drops  
\- Holder Count growing every month  
\- $20 Billion+ Target  
\- Great Distribution + Diamondhands""

Kendu Inu checks all these boxes and has grown to be the prime example of what it means to be a proper memecoin built to take full advantage of not only this cycle but future cycles as well.

Join the community and see first hand the dedication and grind we have no matter what the price action looks like. Paper hands will waver, but true chads will be here until the end.

I’ve never had a good relationship with my mom but i’ve always told my friends I wish I could still be adopted into a family at my age. 

So I (22F) met this lady about two weekends ago at a local DJ event and she was an older lady, it was a no alcohol event as well just tea and coffee. I decided to go up to her and this other lady to make small talk and that’s when they started talking about holidays and that’s when I told them that I usually spend holidays alone and my background and how i’m in school and work full time. She sympathized with me heavily and said that I was more than welcome to join her and her family for thanksgiving. We exchanged numbers and we’ve been sparingly texting each other since the event. I honestly didn’t think she was being serious but she definitely is. She’ll usually text me saying she’s thinking of me, saying good morning beautiful, sending pix of her grandkids, etc. overall just trying to make me feel included.

She said it’ll be hosted at her nephews place and that we can meet at hers and go from there. She sent me her address and her house is like the size of a mansion. So my question remains, am I overthinking this situation? I’ve met people and some of my friends through the internet so I feel like this is nothing.

Isidore looked around the hotel room and frowned. She just stood there, refusing to sit, drop her own small bag or even hand over Persephone. I had noticed, now that I had gotten to know her, that she was not docile. Rather, her nature was to be very careful how she confronted me. Once she decided how she was going to react, she was impossibly stubborn, resolute even. I sighed, realizing she now found the hotel unacceptable.

""We need a miracle. Can't stay here."" I gestured as if the room had just had an earthquake and was in shambles.

""Of course."" Detective Winters cleared his throat. He had set down his keys and the detachment from the carseat. He picked them back up.

""Where are we going?"" Isidore asked, wondering. She sounded as young as our child, the way she spoke.

""Somewhere warm and clean. You will be most welcome, Isidore."" Detective Winters told her.

""I thank you, sir."" Isidore said politely. I realized it was the only thing she had ever said to Detective Winters.

We left the hotel room behind and checked out. Just before evening we arrived at the shoreline home of Detective Winters. We slowly climbed the back stairs. At the top a large man was barbequing and said to us:

""I take my barbequing seriously."" Then he laughed heartily and added: ""Hey, Jack Frost. How you doing?""

""Please, these are important guests for Threnody."" Detective Winters told the man and gestured towards us.

""Anything for you, Jack L. Winters. Good old jackal, get it? Jack L.? Isn't your middle name Lamentation? Man your name sucks, middle name sounds horrible. Let's just go with good old jackal, Jack L."" The big man who was on the back porch rambled about Detective Winters excitedly.

""Could you go and get Threnody, please?"" Detective Winters requested.

""Why don't you just go in and see her? I am sure Mrs. Winters would love to see you, she's in there, inside your house. I would love it if you just went in. There's some beer in the fridge and I am making plenty. I bet you all are hungry."" The chef said to Detective Winters. He sounded slightly wounded and was making a valiant effort to be awesome towards Detective Winters.

Detective Winters went inside and we followed him.

Mrs. Winters appeared at the top of the staircase. Her long white hair was braided into rows and her cyan dress flowed like a thawing, cool, mountain stream. She had a coldness to her that could freeze a man's soul with just her stare. When her eyes spotted Isidore and Persephone: winter ended.

She fluttered from her frozen perch; forgetting to destroy the intruding men with her icebeam stare. When she gently landed in front of Isidore and the baby she had thawed into a radiant warmth. Isidore smiled and handed her Persephone. I could see that this was love at first sight.

""Isidore is a young mother, a very kind woman, who was abandoned by her boyfriend after he got her pregnant."" Detective Winters told Mrs. Winters Persephone's story: ""This child now has her mother and her father in her life; and in this reunion, they have nowhere to live. His home is in foreclosure and I found him living in a boarded up meth lab. I have made him into a decent detective's assistant, he has talent with murders.""

""They are your family?"" Mrs. Winters looked up at her husband. I cannot describe the look she was giving him, as though he had finally returned her love after a long time, in some way. Marriage is a strange landscape to behold, for outsiders. What seems to matter does not. What matters is often hidden behind abstract behavior.

I noticed Cory had not come inside. He was speaking to the man outside. The huge chef kept cooling off slivers of meat and giving them to him.

I realized this was going to be our home. It felt dangerous to accept something wholesome. It was intolerable, as I stood there, so I just went and sat down on the most comfortable couch in the world, kicked off my shoes and went to sleep.

I woke up in the darkness hearing snoring. I sat up and found one of the couches was out into a bed and both Detective Winters and Cory were on it. Cory was off to one corner and Detective Winters was sleeping at a weird angle. I could see why Cory had felt secure sleeping there: Detective Winters would have to roll like an action hero to crush the bird. I'd never seen Detective Winters move in his sleep.

Isidore was on the back porch, looking out over the water. I went out there. It was quite chilly.

""Lord, I have trusted you and even though you left, I was right about you. This is no different. Will you accept me? All I offer is myself and our daughter."" Isidore asked me, her eyes shone in the starlight.

""I do."" I promised her. I smiled to myself, trying to remember when I had disliked her and left her. It was a mystery to me.

""That's good."" Isidore leaned over on me. The warmth between us felt good in the cool night air.

""Where is Persephone?"" I wondered. It amazed me she was out of our sight.

""She has her own room already."" Isidore breathed. ""We are to live here, her and I.""

""Just the two of you?"" I felt a pang of regret.

""Until you get a job and a home for us, yeah."" Isidore looked up at me.

""Oh, of course."" I agreed. ""That is what I want.""

""You can't just do that. You don't get to."" Isidore poked me. ""I know all about you.""

""You do?"" I stammered. I wondered if she knew about the Folk of the Shaded Places and of the demon that was haunting us. I wondered if she knew...*how*...I was arrested by Detective Winters and also by a cat. I could not forget that I had to obey Ket or my daughter would not breathe with his blessing.

""Of course. I expect you to do what you are supposed to do, not what I fancy you doing. Can't I just be wishful? Forget it, my love, I am happy here and I am happy you are here. That is all I really mean to say."" Isidore rambled.

""It's fine."" I held her closer. I used to dislike her persistent nothings. Now they meant something. She just wanted to use her voice and what she was saying didn't matter. It was her voice she was using, her will, the voice the expression of Man's will. I did not wish for her silence. Not anymore, I had changed, grown. I had learned to value her thoughts, even if they were trivial or inconsistent. Better than grim logic and endless horrors.

""You have changed."" She stopped talking and went quiet before she said with some thought: ""I feel different when you are near me, it's even better.""

""I agree."" I honestly did. So she did know me, I could not deny that. I doubted she knew the places I had gone, how could she?

""Do you want to go see her?"" Isidore whispered with a conspirator's tone. I did and so we went quietly back into the house and up the stairs to the room across from Mrs. Winter's room. Her door was closed and the baby's door was open.

I heard the door to Mrs. Winter's room open behind us. It was that big chef guy. He came tiptoeing out behind us. I looked at him, wondering with a loud look on my face how he had caught us sneaking in on the baby. He grinned dumbly and pointed to a baby monitor he was holding. He had an earpiece, too.

We all crept like ninjas into the nursery. There was Persephone, sleeping there, entirely unaware of the faces peering down on her. Her little hand went to her mouth, looking for it. Then she touched her lips and, reassured they were still there, reached her hand stretched out and then back again. And she lay still. I wondered if it was a dream she was having, or just muscles rehearsing their best moves. Maybe it was both.

The next morning I awoke to the smell of breakfast cooking. Mrs. Winters's boyfriend had gone out and bought a bunch of stuff before dawn and cooked breakfast. I deducted that he couldn't have slept. He wasn't as energetic and smiling as before, but was still friendly, just exhausted. I appreciated his sacrifice. It meant Isidore and I were both sleeping soundly. He fed everyone breakfast and brought Detective Winters a large mug with a police badge on it with black coffee.

""That's for you, bro. I know you like your coffee black."" He grinned stupidly and patted Detective Winters on his back affectionately. Detective Winters had a pained looked on his face. He sipped the coffee politely and then sorta smiled.

""It's good."" Detective Winters set it down and suddenly got up and fled out the back.

""What, Jack?"" He called after him but Detective Winters was gone.

I guessed he had gone down to his car to be alone, smoke a cigarette. I had noticed he had not had one this entire time. It was either the baby or his wife or both, that had kept him from smoking. Now he felt some really awkward social pressure and he had retreated. He needed the smoke to escape. I pitied him.

Mrs. Winters appeared out of a mist. I was surprised my hand didn't hurt. Her boyfriend looked sorry and said:

""I don't know why he left."" He shrugged his huge shoulders, saluting with the spatula.

""It's okay, he doesn't live here. It was time he was going, that's all."" Mrs. Winters told the man.

""He didn't eat his breakfast. His coffee."" The big guy lamented. The sight of Detective Winters's empty chair and full steaming cup took the smile off his face. I realized he wasn't a boy. I hadn't seen his man face until that moment; like he was some kind of idolizing fan of Detective Winters.

""Where'd you get that mug?"" Mrs. Winters noticed the oversized police mug. She seemed bemused as she picked it up and walked casually across the kitchen with it. I noticed Isidore and Cory were also watching this entire exchange intently as we ate breakfast.

""It's the one I got for him in case he came for Christmas."" Her boyfriend confessed.

""It was very thoughtful for you to get this for him. I am sure he likes it."" She smiled for him. She poured the hot coffee down the sink.

""I wish I could get him something really nice."" He admitted. She ignored his request to get her husband a more lavish gift and focused on the one at hand:

""That's the same gift you rewrapped in case he came for his birthday?"" She was talking to him and looked at me as she rinsed the mug out and dried it off.

""Well yeah, I mean it would be weird to give him his gift from Christmas."" He laughed at the thought.

""Tell him I love him."" Mrs. Winters handed me the mug.

""Tell him we love him."" Her boyfriend told me.

""Thank you for everything. I will be back often."" I kissed Isidore and then Persephone. ""I love you.""

""Come as often as you can. This is your home too."" Mrs. Winters promised me. I nodded at her generosity and left out the back door to go find Detective Winters.

What I found startled me. Detective Winters had cried bitterly. Cory and I got into the back and sat there while he got a smoke lit and sat there catching his breath.

""She loves you. They both do."" I told him.

""I know. Thanks."" He gave me a flash of a smile to show he was alright. I handed him the mug.

""That is an honorable gift."" Cory admired the mug. ""It is a cup.""

""Thanks. I know."" Detective Winters held it up and admired the badge. It kinda looked like a real badge, with gold.

""I would like to come back often."" I added. To that he said nothing. He set down the mug on the passenger seat and started the car, flicking his cigarette, still lit, out onto the sand.

He drove us out of there like we had to be somewhere.

I reflected on that as hours of tedious paperwork at the police station nearly drove me mad for the rest of the day. That afternoon he made a bunch of phonecalls and reviewed some cases. As evening approached he called a cab and sent me to a motel.

The place had a musty smell. He showed up around eleven and looked at me like I was his prisoner. I felt admonished, as though this were how his own father had treated him. Always his cruel demeanor and disrespect for my privacy. He decided where I slept, ate and spent my days. I was his prisoner, his hostage. It was an unspoken arrangement, that I dared not say anything about.

...

I heard a scratch at the door and I leapt to get it. A small gray and black stormcloud was there with emerald eyes. He meowed sagely and slowly and I had no idea what he was saying. Then he turned and fled into the night.

I collapsed. My heart skipped a beat. Would Persephone live? I was choking on the thought.

""My Lord?"" Cory hopped up to me. ""What is wrong? He said they will have use for you soon, most likely. It was just a 'heads up'. Don't be afraid, Ket has invested a favor of the Goddess in you. That is not to be wasted on a miscommunication.""

""Okay."" I gulped, the panic subsiding. I realized I was terrified, unable to obey creatures I could not understand. Only if Cory heard them could I know their demands.

I went and laid back down and fell asleep. In the morning, Detective Winters was all about business. We got McDonald's at the drivethrough for breakfast and he poured the coffee into the mug as we ate.

""That will give vigor to your soul."" Cory promised Detective Winters as he went for another floor fry. He sipped the oversized mug with a badge on it and nodded in agreement.

""This coffee is incorrigible and the mug makes it mine."" He said in his own poetry.

I felt as though I were deprived of poetic words and adventures, since I had met him. It was like a breath of fresh air, just one breath. I sighed to myself and Cory ate fries off the floor.

""Thanks for breakfast."" I sipped my juice.

""Alright, because now we have work to do."" He drove us out to Ministry.

There I beheld the destitution of the area. A wall of burning tires on one side and a row of skeletal cars rusting on the other. We got out and crossed the police tape into the ancient trailer village.

""There should be one last witness. Nobody can find her."" Detective Winters found a forensics detective and bought her remaining pack of *Salem* for fifty dollars. He told her she had pretty eyes also, and that if she quit smoking now, she would win the lottery someday. He lit one after she and the others departed.

""The witness is around here somewhere?"" I looked around.

""Yes. Menthols taste awful. These are atrociously stale, I am sure she was quitting. These are the best smokes, you have no idea what these are like."" Detective Winters sounded like a connoisseur of such tobacco. ""You know, tobacco is used in shamanistic practices? And in voodoo?""

""Fascinating."" I surmised.

""That woman carried these around on her, not smoking them. She is just like me, except less jaded, I suppose. She wanted to quit, so these got old, got carried around in this soft pack getting old and wrinkly. They got grey while she kept a little bit of her youth by not smoking them. You see? I understand magic, these aren't just cigarettes, they are relics of solving mysteries. They have their own kind of magic, don't you get it?""

""Not really."" I told him honestly. ""Where to, where fair paths shall meet?""

""Not brightly, my Lord."" Cory flew up and looked around before he returned. He whispered: ""Or perhaps brightly.""

""Where shall we go?"" I asked and he clicked his directions, using his claws to steer me. Detective Winters followed us, smoking his magic cigarettes.

A girl sat on the back porch watching the gators as they swam back and forth. I noticed the reptiles could easily come up the embankment for her if they chose to. She looked at us and smiled. I asked the kid:

""Did you see what happened here?"" And pointed back towards the murder scene. She shook her head and I saw that on the side of her head were burn scars, ones that had taken her right ear.

""You have scars on the side of you head."" Cory flitted to her side and told her. She smiled at the talking crow and then looked back at me.

""It's a trick."" She shook her head and smiled, showing her missing baby teeth. She was nobody's fool, apparently.

""He really talks."" Detective Winters told her. ""Do you talk? Can you tell me what happened? I am Detective Winters."" He told her and showed her his badge. She wanted to hold it.

""That's not a real badge."" She grinned and handed it back.

""Alright. I can see that you are going to tell us that you don't talk to strangers, is that it?"" Detective Winters asked the little girl. He sounded irritated.

""Not unless you have candy."" She grinned again.

""We don't have any candy."" I informed Detective Winters quietly.

""I realize that. Maybe we just leave Cory here, think she would talk to him?"" Detective Winters requested. I looked back at her and thought she seemed nice. I doubted there was any danger in leaving my crow alone with this person.

We walked away and Detective Winters worked on the *Salem* pack. While we waited Cory spoke to the burnt child with the strange attitude. She told him about the murders.

Cory came back and told us:

""She says that the men who did this were from the marshes. They have something bad back there. Her mom and dad and the others were arguing with them. That was before she hid. Then the killings happened."" Cory told one of his best stories. I was proud of him, I almost understood the whole thing.

""Lord, guide me to their bad something."" Detective Winters bid me.

""Shouldn't we get backup?"" I trembled in terror. The thought of confronting murderous marsh savages terrified me.

""You are right. Let's get backup."" He agreed. I felt relieved for a moment until he went to the trunk of his car and got out *Streetsweeper* and started loading the automatic shotgun. ""Got it, let's go.""

""That's it?"" I was scared.

""Take me to them. If they are there and it's as the kid says, I will call in the SWAT, okay?"" Detective Winters promised.

""I don't want to die."" I told Detective Winters.

""Death will always happen."" Cory squawked merrily. He already knew where we were going, and easily guided me to the path. We headed towards the reptile infested waters.

The marsh was a quiet place. Where few men go, that is where the most things that wish to be apart from man go. The marsh had cool shade and slowly shimmering light. The breeze sang a very old and gentle rhythm as we walked.

Up ahead I saw the fence decorated in dolls and baskets. More dolls and stick effigies hung in the trees all around. I noticed chicken bones and other animal bones scattered all over the ground everywhere. The huts were of branches and large brown swamp leaves. Trails of weak and sickly smoke adorned a few smoldering campfires.

The Marsh Folk came out with weapons made of wood and bone. Their clan leader had an old rifle and a cavalry saber. He grunted brutishly at us. The smell of them was quite foul. They glared with yellowed and bloodshot eyes and had dirt on their skin and bone piercings.

I was startled and stepped back, gasping. I gripped a tree as their leader came forward, brandishing his weapon, the old rifle. He was howling like an orangutan and dancing a war dance to scare us off. I was scared and hid behind the tree I had found.

""Police! Drop the weapon!"" Detective Winters commanded. The Marsh Folk leader just raised the rifle.

""Don't shoot them!"" I yelled. I could see they had women and children. One of the young Marsh Folk females was holding an infant. I forgot I was in danger and rushed to stop Detective Winters, my right hand aching.

The old rifle came alive with a crack and a puff of smoke. I felt a sharp sting enter my shoulder from the side and then out my back. I staggered and turned from the impact and then fell over. I fought to keep my eyes open, begging my mortal coil to stay intact. For a moment I thought I was going to die. I had gotten shot. I rolled over and looked and saw blood all over me and all over the ground. I could see it spraying freely from the wound. Then I lost consciousness.

I awoke see the shape of flames in flesh. Where they had kissed her, half her life ago. The little girl was kneeling over me. The Marsh Folk were gathered around and so was Detective Winters. He hadn't shot them.

""She is the thousandth star of the thousandth star."" Cory whispered into my ear. ""I thought I mentioned that."" he then laughed his clicking laughter.

""I will be found by a new family."" She claimed. I looked at Detective Winters and he nodded.

I got up slowly and touched my wound. Completely healed, barely a scar.

""How could you do this?"" I asked her. She shrugged.

She pointed to Cory: ""He said I could.""

Cory did a little bow for her and said: ""The honor is mine.""

""You did not hurt the Marsh Folk."" I looked around and looked at Detective Winters.

""They surrendered."" He shrugged. ""I was loaded up with beanbags anyway.""

""And the killers?"" I was helped up by the leader of the Marsh Folk.

Detective Winters touched them each on the shoulder with his weapon and they struggled to their feet. He had put zip ties on the hands of three of the Marsh Folk. He took them with us, along with the child.

""Will you be alright?"" The little girl asked me.

I could only rub my gunshot wound, as the ache was but a memory, and say: ""I am sure.""",2,1732728500.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False

Alright Gentlemen. I'm a man of my word. It is done. I tried the sonic Dr Pepper. Let's get into it.

First, you're damn right the syrup is crazy sweet... Learn from me gentlemen, STIR BEFORE DRINKING. Otherwise the vile horror you will experience... 🤢

Next, the taste. It reminds me of a coffee creamer. No, not coffee. A coffee creamer. There's this creaminess aspect and there is something similar to brown sugar and maybe with a touch of maple or vanilla maybe. 🤔 Not bad overall for flavor profile.

Lastly, I think this experience could be better if you order an additional Dr Pepper with it and mix the two. Maybe it's just too much syrup but the stir definitely helps. Stir it, mix it. It's not bad. It's not excellent. But worth a try!

Would I try it again? Yeah but I'd order a second Dr Pep with it and do some diluting to make it just the right amount.

1h19otp,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1h19otp/it_took_me_8_years_to_realize_i_never_went_back/,It took me 8 years to realize I never went back to normal ,"In 2016 my first child died when she was only a baby. 

I was living in an unfamiliar country speaking an unfamiliar language. My wife’s homeland. 

Her family wasn’t particularly nice to either of us but they were quite unkind to me, telling me outright that my pain meant less because I am a man. I may not have carried the child in my belly, but I carried her tiny casket to her grave. I would think that counts for something but I digress. Their treatment of my wife also sparked several arguments between us as well and drove a wedge between me and her family that lasts until today. They have resolved things amongst themselves with my wife but I will never speak or lend a favor to them again. 

All of this shitty treatment, combined with the isolation of being asked where I’m from when I’m silently grieving and trying to get a coffee or a Big Mac just led me to hate interacting with people. 

Time went on and I did not make any friends in my new land and I drifted apart from the friends in my old one. And I became that guy who keeps to himself. I have absolutely zero non-essential interactions with humans outside of work. None besides my wife and child. 

My wife and I went through our own tumultuous “recovery”. Intimacy problems, arguments, near-divorces, you name it. But we survived, I suppose. 

I thought I had taken the right steps. Changed my career path to do something more satisfying and pays better. I take care of myself physically. I like to take my wife and other daughter out to do fun things. 

But my wife, after me noticing her distant for some time, finally tells me that she hates this person I’ve become. That I don’t “smile at people” any more. That my isolation bothers her. Which I don’t know why. I don’t cling to her and allow her to have plenty of alone time or time with friends. Just because I don’t go frolicking with a group of friends, we aren’t on equal footing? 

I guess I realize it might not be normal to not have a single friend on earth. It doesn’t bother me much anymore. It did for a while but now, if anything, I’m addicted to the solitude. I can give my wife and daughter my time and then if they don’t need it, I get my time.

I suppose I need to try to find a happy medium between isolation and smiling at everyone my wife wants me to smile at. (That’s a cultural difference in my opinion. Why would I smile when seeing someone I haven’t seen for 6+ months and have no memories with?). But I guess I just don’t see it happening at this point. I’m not going to “put myself out there” and force friendships. I’m a 31 year old father with a job. 

I’m not a timid person, I have enough confidence when I walk and talk that people at work would have no idea something was “wrong”. I wear a mask in a sense. 

Did anyone else fall into the same world of isolation? I’m 31, so would be helpful to hear from someone who lived this way perhaps even longer than I. 

Did you overcome the isolation? Or did you own it further until a point of no return?  ",2,1732728377.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

I have recently purchased a self-leveling spring tamper, and I noticed I get faster extractions and a bit of channeling when using that instead of my standard tamper.

I feel that I can't get the coffee to be as compact as the previous method, simply because of the spring resistance.

With that being said, how should I go about it? Should I try harder and put more effort in tampering it with the new tamper? Should I keep the pressure and grind finer?

For context, the older tamper never gave me any channeling or this fast of extraction times.

Last, before you ask how it tastes, it tastes sour, so I really feel I have to either try to press harder, go back to my OG tamper, or grind finer, just want to hear your thoughts;

Thanks and happy espressos!

EDIT: 

Former tamper is a Gaggia Classic Tamper 58mm (stainless steel and wood). New one is a spring tamper from AliExpress 58mm too ofc. Nothing fancy, just self-leveling.

1h19kfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1h19kfy/spoilers_extended_the_focus_on_menu_elaborate/,"(Spoilers Extended) The focus on menu / elaborate food descriptions goes way back, before ASOIAF...","Recently read ""Fevre Dream"", the first novel GRRM had published, in 1982, a decade before he started writing ASOIAF. Not going to give away the plot or any spoilers here, but it's a vampire novel set on the Mississippi River, before the American Civil War. Almost all the action takes place on riverboats and in the towns they stop at. 

And...there is food...there are hearty and elaborate meals...there are menus ordered, and described...there are key plot events that take place at meals...and banquets, where horrible things might happen...It's very familiar territory to those who have read ASOIAF. George is consistent in his likes. 

Laughed when I encountered this on page 5.

*""A waiter appeared. 'With you be dining with Mister York, Cap'n?"" ""Please do,"" York urged.*

*""I believe I will,"" Marsh said. York might be able to outstare him, but there was no man on the river could outeat him. 'I'll have some of that soup, and a dozen oysters, and a couple of roast chickens with taters and stuff. Crisp 'em up good, mind you. And something to wash it all down with.* *What are you drinking, York?' 'Burgundy.' 'Fine, fetch me a bottle of the same."" York looked amused. 'You have a formidable appetite, Captain'.""*

Indeed. And the dining continues as the book progresses. 

*""Abner Marsh took his lunch in the Planters' House dining room, eating off by himself in the corner...He ate a leg of lamb in mint sauce, a mess of turnips and snap beans, and three helpings of tapioca, but even that didn't calm him...""*

And another:

*""Then Abner Marsh waited, and took what solace he could in a lovely dinner of roast pork and green beans and onions, with half a blueberry pie afterwards.""*

Later, a character quotes Byron about, guess what, meal metaphors:

*""...a meal was brought / With blood, and each sate sullenly apart / Gorging himself in gloom; no Love was left; All earth was but one thought--and that was death...""*

And then there are descriptions of cooking:

*""Marsh...made his way to the kitchen, aft of the wheelhouse. Behind the kitchen doors he found activity; a couple of Tony's kitchen boys were stirring big copper pots or pan-frying chicken...Marsh could smell pies baking in the huge ovens. It made his mouth water...He found Toby in the starboard galley, surrounded on all sides by stacks of cages full of chickens and pigeons and here and there were some robins, and ducks and such...three headless birds were piled up by his elbows...""*

Anyway, you get the point. Including descriptions of food and dining seems to have been important to GRRM for a long time. NOT being critical of it, just wanted to share the observation and evidence. Thought Thanksgiving Week (in the United States at least) would be a good time to make a post about menus.

We normally tilt the cup to make space for the pitcher tip and create more time for art, but as we push the blobs for each stack, try pivoting your cup hand so your palm is facing towards the ceiling. Do this at the same time as you push milk with your pitcher hand and hopefully you'll notice you have more room for stacks.

Not my cleanest work but hopefully you see what I mean.

1h19e0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_FriskyMinx58/comments/1h19e0s/an_amazing_morning_surprise/,An amazing morning surprise ," I just had to share, after chatting recently with a sweet man here things progressed to him sharing a beautiful picture of his soft sexy manhood. (something I love to see)
 My mind filled with heavenly thoughts since, I shared the photo with my friend and daughter in law as we were all working on our upcoming Thanksgiving dinner. 
 After our evening girl time I went home for the night and tried to take care of myself in the shower before setting down for the late. 
 This morning as I'm enjoying my morning coffee I get my daily good morning text from Lynda after a little chat she tells me to come for a little visit. She's my neighbor and I assumed this was her asking for a little morning play, which happens often but that's another story. 
 I step out of the back door and across the yard and let myself in. I drop my robe and pj's on the couch on my way to her room. 
I step through her bedroom door and am immediately shocked to see that she wasn't alone. Next to her in bed is the body of a man sleeping with her night shirt over his head. 
 I whisper what the hell and she just smiles and pulls back the covers revealing a gorgeous body of a man. 
 My eyes go straight to a beautifully placed set of balls and a semi hard cock. 
 I'm told by Lynda to get in bed and enjoy. 
She knows my love of a soft cock and my lust for encounters with strangers. 
 I climb in with them and immediately take hold of this delicious manhood. 
It's so soft and warm, I start to slowly stroke it and after a few minutes he begins to stir. 
 Lynda holds her hand over his covered face and tells him that he is not allowed look. 
 Her forceful tone excites me and she knows it. I'm told to continue and I do so with great enthusiasm. 
 This beautiful cock is now fully hard in my hand and I'm just buzzing, I take him in my mouth and the feeling is absolute heaven. 
 While I'm taking my time to enjoy this strange man I feel her teasing my nipples with one hand and rubbing between my legs as well. 
 I am so beyond turned on at this point and lost in so many thoughts. 
 I barely noticed that Lynda is slowly playing with my ass, applying lube and then gently fingering me. Her attention is now causing me to moan loudly. 
 I truly felt drunk at this point since it's been a while since I've enjoyed a man. 
 Lynda soon tells me to lay down on the bed and as I do she orders this man of hers to turn and get under my legs. 
 I'm a bit confused at first until she grabs his cock and guides him to my now well lubed ass. 
 I'm stunned at first looking at her and she just holds a finger to her lips shushing me. 
 As she's guiding him closer to me she tells him to take it easy on me. 
 It felt like hours as he took his time giving me everything he had. 
 Once we were comfortable with each others position he took to giving me complete pleasure, long slow thrusts while playing with my nipples. 
 I could feel myself building, holding a death grip on his arm and shortly before I was going to explode Lynda started rubbing my clit hard and fast. 
 It was a total sensory overload. I screamed so loud I'm sure the people across the street could hear. 
 My new friend took this opportunity to pick up his pace which caused my climax to just roll one after another. 
 Minutes later he warned us that he was close. 
 Lynda pulled him from me and stroked him to completion I'm guessing. 
I couldn't see as I was nothing but mush on the bed. 
 Afterwards I slowly composed myself as best I could, gathered my pj's and returned home to lay down and replay what just happened. 
 Feel free to ask me anything to clarify

Anyway!  
Hi all! Not sure to what put here.. So I'll make this up as I go, I guess. I'm 25/F, living in Cali, just looking for some fun folks to DM here or on Discord and kill some time with. Please don't message though if you're gonna do 1-3 words at a time. I'd like an actual conversation.

Best way to get my attention is via a DM. I'm likely not gonna be checking replies/notifications on this post.

Hobbies of mine include:

Video Games - Recently beat Baldur's Gate 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. I just started Dragon Age: The Veilguard the other day. I play tons of genres though. Even toss in a few rounds of Overwatch from time to time.

Horror Movies - Horror is life. Especially a lot of the older stuff. Not to say that new stuff can't be good too, though, because it certainly can. Recent obsession is the Terrifier series. All three of those were so much fun.

Music - I lean heavily towards rock and metal, but I'll listen to almost anything. Angus McSix is my favorite band, it's power metal. I'm always open to new suggestions. Discovered Ice Nine Kills recently and been loving them, too.

Also a big (American) football fan, if anyone out there would like to talk about that.

I started my pourover journey about a year ago and I have been having a blast. I like to do things by the book as best as possible but I didnt know what to do with the odd amount of coffee at the bottom of the bags I go through. 

  
So, I started to record them and lump them together into a blend that I make and test.   
This is the second edition and I used almost exclusively Natural ferment beans and it is awesome!

Results: Great Success  
Big bakers spice, dark chocolate, and raspberrry/blackberry notes. I brewed it at 96\*C with a 1:16 ratio using a 45"" bloom and an agitated pour to full volume. 

Huge shout outs to Corvus, Dak, and Sightseer for the funky great beans. 

What do you do with your leftover beans?

1h19cto,https://www.reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1h19cto/fellow_opus_grind_comparison/,Fellow Opus Grind Comparison ,"I've been into pour overs the last few years and religiously used the 1zpresso K-Max with v60. Occasionally used the Baratza Encore ESP for our espresso machine with pretty solid results. Recently recieved the Aiden machine for those early mornings where we need a few cups, and for when we have guests. 

I ordered the Fellow Opus to use for continuity with the fellow drops grind settings etc. I got it about a week ago and worked through a few different settings- on setting 7 with an under 350ml pour I made the most bitter, disgusting cup I've made- ever. I switched it to max settings, which should be suitable to cold brew level and it was just coarse enough for a solid pour over. Meanwhile I was able to dial in espresso around 2.75 and was great. But I didn't love that the main reason I'm buying this is for large amounts of coffee in the Aiden and I can't seem to get it coarse enough. 

This led me to purchase ANOTHER Opus and compare. Right away the coarsest setting was coarse, looked like you'd make it for cold brew. Between the 7-8 setting was brewing solid cups of coffee in the Aiden, right where I was semi expecting. Now, in regards to espresso i have it all the way down to 1.25 and it is borderline coming out too fast. It seems crazy to go finer than that and crazy there'd be such drastic differences between two machines. Im happy with the current pour over grind of the current one, and am wondering how to adjust for the espresso. My usual workflow is 18g in, 36-40g out, WDT tamp and bottomless portfilter. Would it be better to up to 19 or 20g to see how the espresso changes? Thanks! ",2,1732727529.0,FellowProducts,0,1.0,False

1h19b5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1h19b5n/i_found_a_peeping_tom_in_my_apartment_building/,I Found A Peeping Tom In My Apartment Building,"I remember the day I moved into the apartment. I was excited. I thought a fresh start in this big building, with its clean, sterile hallways and well-manicured lawns, would finally bring me peace. Maybe I’d meet new people—finally make some friends. The space was quiet. It was comforting.

But I never did make friends. I kept to myself, spent most of my time at my desk, struggling to make ends meet with freelance gigs that barely paid enough for rent. The walls felt so thick at first, like I was insulated from everything outside. A cocoon. But now… now it feels like the walls are alive.

At first, everything was fine. I relished the quiet, the solitude. I’d sit in my cramped little room, the desk shoved against the single window overlooking the alley, and write. The sounds of the city filtered in through the thin walls—the hum of traffic, the distant blare of sirens, the occasional argument spilling out from the neighboring apartments. But in here, I felt safe.

*That’s when I found the hole.*

I discovered it by accident one night while rearranging the furniture. The fridge was old and heavy, and when I tried to push it against the wall, it scraped across the floor with a hideous screech. That’s when I saw it—a small, dark space, hidden behind where the fridge used to sit. It was odd. Just big enough for a person to squeeze through. A perfectly carved passage, almost too perfect. Like it had been waiting for me.

At first, I ignored it. I pushed the fridge back into place and told myself it didn’t matter. It was just an old building—quirky, filled with forgotten nooks and crannies. But that hole… it lingered in my mind. Days passed, and I kept thinking about it. Every time I sat down to work, it was there, gnawing at the back of my brain. What was inside? Where did it lead?

*Curiosity finally got the better of me.*

One night, I pulled the fridge back, and there it was—dark, beckoning. I crawled inside, feeling the cool, stale air wrap around me as I squeezed my way through. It wasn’t long before the narrow passage opened into a hidden hallway.

The walls were damp, the smell of mildew thick in the air. Trash littered the floor—discarded clothes, candy wrappers, and God knows what else. I should have turned back right then. But something about that hallway… it drew me in. *Like it was meant for me.*

The first time I crawled through the hole, I noticed how narrow the passageway was. The air inside was thick, humid, and I could barely breathe as I shimmied forward on my hands and knees. The walls brushed against my skin, wet and clammy, like some kind of... living organism. The space around me pulsed, like it was alive. My skin crawled, but I couldn’t stop. I kept moving, though, drawn forward by a strange compulsion, until I found myself staring into a peephole. 

It was a young couple. They were laughing, sitting close together on the couch. So happy. So unaware of the world outside. I watched them for a long time, my breath shallow. They didn’t see me. They couldn’t see me. But something about the way they were... it reminded me of something I’d lost. I didn’t realize how much time had passed until the man looked directly at the wall where the peephole was. My heart stopped. I swear for a moment he saw me. His eyes locked onto mine, even though there was no way he could.

I scrambled back, my hands shaking. But I couldn’t stop. I moved forward, toward the next apartment.

Each apartment was worse than the last. In one room, a group of friends were playing video games, music blaring through the speakers. Their laughter echoed through the walls, loud and mocking. They were oblivious to everything around them, even as I pressed my face closer, hungry to be part of their world. But I wasn’t. I was nothing more than a shadow. A ghost in their space.

The next room... I wish I hadn’t looked. There was an old woman. She was hunched over, knitting something in the dim light, her bony fingers trembling as they worked the yarn. She looked just like my grandmother. But when she turned her head to the side, I saw her face—sunken eyes, skin hanging loose like she was already dead. I stepped back, gasping for air, but it was like the walls had grown tighter around me.

*Then came the room with the violent sound.*

I heard it before I saw it. The dull thud of something heavy hitting flesh. The sickening sound of bones breaking. My stomach churned as I looked through the peephole.

A man stood over a woman’s lifeless body, his chest heaving, his face twisted in rage. Blood stained the floor, the walls. The woman’s eyes stared blankly at the ceiling. I wanted to scream, to call the police, to do anything. But I couldn’t move. I was frozen, my hand trembling against the wall.

The man towered over her lifeless body, breathing heavily, and then—then he looked up. *Right at the wall. Right at me* and *His lips curled into a smile.*

I stumbled back, my heart racing. What the hell was this place? Who had made this passage? Was I the only one who knew about it? My mind was a blur of questions, but before I could turn and run, I saw another door. This one was different. There was a light shining underneath it, spilling into the dark hallway. It beckoned me, just like the hole had.

I approached, my breath shallow, and pressed my eye to the peephole.

It was a room unlike any of the others. The walls were lined with mirrors, lights framing each one like a backstage dressing room. There were costumes scattered across the floor—feather boas, sequined dresses, hats of all shapes and sizes. And in the center of the room was a single chair, facing a mirror.

Something inside me… shifted. I opened the door and stepped inside. The air was different here. Warmer, somehow. Inviting.

There was a large, ornate mirror with lights around the edges, like something you’d see in a dressing room. There were clothes scattered everywhere—old costumes, hats, masks. It looked like a movie set. My breathing slowed. This place—it felt familiar.

I stepped inside, drawn to the mirror. My reflection stared back at me, but there was something wrong with it. My face looked... twisted. The longer I stared, the more my reflection began to move on its own. It smiled when I didn’t. It tilted its head, eyes narrowing like it knew.

I bolted back into my apartment, heart pounding against my ribcage. I practically jumped through the hole. The memory of that horrific smile haunted me—*the man who killed his wife.* I needed to escape, to block it all out. But how could I? The hole behind the fridge loomed in my mind like a sinister invitation.

I needed a moment to breathe, to gather my thoughts. What should I have done? Should I call the police? I walked to the kitchen, my hands shaking as I drank a glass of water. I stared out the window at the dimly lit parking lot below. Something felt off. *Maybe, I was just hallucinating….*

As nightfall covered the skies, *I decided to sleep away the uncertain reality,* to wash away the horrors of the day. But as darkness wrapped around me, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was not alone. The walls whispered secrets I couldn’t decipher, and shadows danced just beyond my field of vision.

Then came the sound—a soft rustling, like fabric brushing against skin. My heart raced as I sat up, squinting into the darkness. There, in the corner of my room, was a figure. Dark and menacing, it hovered just out of reach. I felt paralyzed, unable to scream or move.

When I finally mustered the courage to turn on the light, the figure morphed, contorting into the shapes of my room. The shadow stretched, expanding until it seemed to breathe. It lunged toward me, but before it could reach me, it vanished—*like smoke in the wind.*

I woke up the next morning, *it was all a dream…...?* The sunlight filtering through my blinds like a warning. I stumbled into the kitchen; the haunting memory of the dark figure still fresh in my mind. I needed caffeine, something to ground me. As the coffee brewed, I tried to shake off the creeping unease. That’s when my eyes met with the fridge or maybe behind it, *the hole was still there…the uncertain reality was real.* The hole became bigger than ever.

Maybe, there was a peeping tom in the building. I decided to talk to the landlord. I stepped outside, ready to confront him about the uncertainty in my apartment, but the hallway was empty. No one stirred, no voices echoed back. *It was dead silent….* I knocked on a few doors, but nobody answered. It felt strange, but maybe most of the tenants were sleeping.

Just as I was about to head back inside, I spotted a man dressed entirely in black, carrying a heavy bag. His movements were erratic, as if he was in a hurry. 

“Hey!” I called, trying to sound casual. “Excuse me, can you—”

But he ignored me and slipped into the elevator. As the doors began to close, I caught a glimpse of something red peeking from the bag. My heart raced as realization struck—a glimmer of *blood.* It was the man I’d seen earlier—the one who’d killed his wife. 

I stumbled back, horror gripping me like a vice. I bolted up the stairs, my legs feeling like jelly. I burst through my door, gasping for breath, and darted toward the fridge wall. I had to know.

I ripped the fridge away, my hands trembling. There it was, the hole—the same gaping maw I had discovered before. Was it really there? Was any of this real? Panic surged through me. I fumbled for my phone to call the police, but the signal was dead. No bars.

A soft whisper slithered through the hole, chilling me to the bone. “*Come in,*” it beckoned, *low and seductive*. I felt drawn to it, as if it were a siren’s call, promising solace.

“No,” I muttered to myself, backing away. I tried to block the hole with my hands, but every time I turned, it was still there, larger than before, beckoning me with its darkness. I could hear voices now, faint and melodious, urging me to return.

“Come back,” they whispered, “*we can make you whole again.*”



I crawled through the hole, the familiar sensation of panic washed over me as I entered the narrow corridor. The atmosphere felt different—thicker, more suffocating, as if the walls were closing in.

As I moved forward, the same scenes unfolded around me—couples laughing, friends playing games—but the warmth and laughter felt tainted. My skin prickled, the hair on my arms standing on end. I continued deeper into the darkness, knowing I had to confront whatever lay ahead.

*And that’s when I found him….*

The same room as before, each item stood in its place perfectly still…. only a new member had moved into the building…. A body laid dead in the corner of the room, its skin pale, its fingernails elongated and dirty, as if he was the filth of the building. I touched him…. his body decomposed right before me…. black liquid oozed of its body…. like he had been dead for many a millennium……

*I had found him…. I had found the peeping tom….*

With each passing moment, I felt a change within me. My body began to feel strange—my skin became pale and clammy, like I was living in a world without sunlight. My fingers elongated, stretching unnaturally as if reaching for something just out of grasp. I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror, and my reflection was grotesque, twisted beyond recognition.

I touched my face, feeling the cool, clammy surface of my skin, the features melting and reforming in the warped glass. I could feel the walls of my apartment morphing around me, the texture becoming fleshy, almost breathing, as veins pulsed underneath the surface. Panic surged through me.

“*What is happening?*” 

I gasped, scratching at the walls, desperate to escape this nightmare. My nails dug into the surface, but instead of breaking through, they sunk in like flesh, giving way beneath my fingertips. *But suddenly…*

I woke up in my bed again…. only this time…*it was all a dream???* No…It can’t be…I walked into the kitchen to brew myself coffee… My eyes shifted themselves towards the hole…It had grown bigger… The scent of coffee brewing filled the air, but it did little to soothe the rising anxiety clawing at my insides. My gaze shifted toward the fridge wall, where the hole waited like an insatiable maw.

*It had grown bigger.* The memory of the dark figure, the chaos, and the grotesque reflection of myself danced through my mind. I shivered, a chill creeping up my spine. I felt a magnetic pull toward it, an undeniable urge to go inside and *rewitness* the events, to make sense of the madness swirling in my head.

*Tonight, I would return.*

As night fell, I sat in my dimly lit apartment, anxiety mingling with anticipation. The coffee had long gone cold, and the shadows seemed to stretch longer, closing in around me. I took a deep breath, steeling myself for the journey ahead.

The moment I crawled through the hole, I felt the familiar sensation wash over me—a cold embrace that wrapped around my body like a shroud. The corridor yawned before me, beckoning me deeper into its twisted embrace. Each step echoed through the emptiness, and I could feel the anticipation thrumming in my veins.

The scenes returned—laughter, love, sorrow, violence. They unfolded before me like a movie reel, each moment drawing me closer to the dark truth lurking just beyond my reach. As I traversed the corridor, I caught glimpses of life happening all around me, the pulse of the building thrumming beneath my feet.

Today, I stumbled upon a room filled with clothes and costumes, the remnants of lives lived outside of mine. My gaze fell on a bowler hat resting on a chair. I reached for it, slipping it onto my head. As I stared into the mirror, I felt a strange shift—a weight lifting, a lightness in my chest. I wasn’t me anymore. I started to dance, laughing at my reflection as I spun in circles. The hat slipped down over my eyes, and for a moment, I forgot everything. Forgot the blood, the death, the darkness. It was just me and the mirror. *I felt less lonely….*

But when I lifted the hat, my reflection wasn’t dancing. It was standing still, grinning at me with wide, unblinking eyes. And behind it—behind me—I saw something move. I began to move, swaying to some invisible rhythm, dancing in front of the mirror like a man possessed. It felt good. Freeing. Like I was shedding my old self, becoming someone new, someone more alive. The people in the building… they didn’t know me. They didn’t see me. But I saw them. I was with them. Their lives, their secrets—they were mine now.

I was the one who watched. I was the one who knew.

*Now I was the peeping Tom* 

Now I wasn’t just some lonely writer anymore, barely scraping by in a tiny apartment. I had become more than that. I was the one who moved through the walls, the one who saw everything, the one who danced in the dark while they lived their ordinary, oblivious lives. *The hole had made me whole*

All along, it had been me. The one watching, the one lurking. Those people in their apartments—they weren’t strangers anymore. They were my friends. My family. And the man who had killed that woman… he was part of it too. He didn’t know I had seen him, but that didn’t matter. I had his secret now, and that made him mine.

I laughed and it felt good to laugh again. When was the last time I had laughed like that?

I stood up, adjusting the hat on my head, and walked back down the hallway. The doors, the rooms, the people—they were all part of my world now. My hidden empire. And as I made my way back to the hole, back to my little apartment, I felt… complete. 

*Madness had consumed me and reality had become me*

The hole had been waiting for me. This place had been waiting for me. And now that I was here, I could see everything clearly.

As I sit here, typing away a story I wish no one can read…. just know…. *I am the Peeping Tom.* 

And maybe… just maybe… *I’m watching you right now, too.*

As you read these words, as your eyes move over the blue screen as you sit there in your quiet little life, maybe I’m there. Just behind you. Just out of sight. Watching. Waiting. You aren’t alone, I am with you…*for you are my friend…*

If you wish to meet me, maybe crawl into a hole just like I did…. you might even find me.",3,1732727411.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

One day, she sent a message through a mutual friend (who was also my friend) warning me that she’d complain to a teacher if I didn’t stop. I was humiliated and frustrated.

A few days later, I avoided looking at her out of fear. However, I noticed she would sometimes smile at me—genuinely. But by then, I had already put her on a pedestal. She continued to smile, but I was too scared to even make eye contact with her. My fear had completely paralyzed me, leaving me heartbroken.

We passed 10th grade without ever speaking to each other. In 2016, we moved on to 11th grade but attended different schools. Occasionally, we’d run into each other. Once, I saw her smile at me, her eyes widening. My heart felt like it was pierced by an arrow. Yet, I couldn’t bring myself to smile back or even make eye contact.

As time went on, her reactions varied. Sometimes she smiled when she saw me; other times, she remained neutral. One day, I noticed her pointing me out to her friend. It seemed like she was saying, “Look, that guy over there is staring at you.”

Another day, while I was stuck in traffic with my uncle on his motorcycle, I noticed a woman on a scooter staring at me. At first, I was confused, thinking, Why is this middle-aged woman staring at me? Then I noticed the girl sitting on the back of the scooter—her mom was driving. The girl wasn’t looking at me but was smiling, clearly enjoying the moment. It dawned on me that she had told her mom about me. I felt embarrassed, but her smile was captivating. She seemed to be genuinely thrilled, showing me to her mom.

Over time, she continued smiling at me, but my confidence had eroded. I couldn’t smile back. I had put her so high on a pedestal that I felt completely unworthy. By the time 12th grade ended, we had never spoken a single word to each other.

After high school, we went to different colleges and didn’t see each other for three years. In 2020, I asked a friend to get her phone number for me, which he did, but I couldn’t muster the courage to text or call her.

In 2021, during the final exams of college, I dreamt about her. At that point, I had started a dropshipping business and told myself she wasn’t a big deal anymore, just an ordinary girl. Coincidentally, I saw her that same evening. When we crossed paths, her eyes widened, and I felt the familiar ache in my heart. Perhaps she felt something too.

After that, I’d see her occasionally—maybe once a year—but she didn’t notice me. Then, on November 11, 2024, I saw her again at her cousin’s wedding. She was sitting on the stage with her mom, cousin, and her cousin’s husband. I sat in the audience, choosing a spot where she could easily see me.

I know she noticed me, but she pretended not to. When I looked at her, she deliberately avoided making eye contact. However, her cousin and cousin’s husband gave me a warm, friendly smile. It caught me off guard, and I freaked out. Their smiles were beautiful, like they were greeting someone important. There’s no way they could’ve known me unless she had told them about me.

Interestingly, I was wearing a white shirt, and her cousin and cousin’s husband were also dressed in white—a strange coincidence. She seemed stressed, perhaps due to family responsibilities, and her mom’s presence made it impossible for me to approach her. Her mom looks intimidating, like a character from a horror movie—almost like the demon nun from The Nun.

On my soul it's so annoying. I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately, and I realized this statement, despite how “neutral” or even progressive it sounds, is actually loaded with a ton of issues. 

Let’s talk about it . 

First of all, who decides what “done well even means? Nine times out of ten, when someone says this, they’re holding stories with diverse characters to some mythical higher standard. Like, a story can’t just exist with marginalized characters or perspectives—it has to prove itself. There’s an unspoken assumption that the presence of diversity of all kinds is inherently risky or unnatural or might drive away white readers; so the story has to work extra hard to justify its existence.

And when people say this, they’re also kind of ignoring the fact that stories with non-diverse casts don’t get the same scrutiny. Nobody is out here saying, “Well, I don’t mind stories with all-white, all-straight casts, but only if it’s done well.” Those stories are just allowed to exist. The assumption is that they’re the default, the baseline, and they don’t have to explain themselves. But if a story centers people of color, or queer folks, or disabled folks, suddenly the pitchforks come out. It’s like, “Well, why are they even here? Does this add to the plot?” Like, do you ask the same question when another gritty white dude with a dead wife gets a whole TV series?

What really gets me is when people claim they “don’t care about color at all, as long as the story is good.” That’s such a disingenuous statement. If you truly didn’t care about the identities of the characters, why is the diversity worth mentioning at all? The fact that you’re even bringing it up tells me it’s not as neutral to you as you’re pretending. It’s almost like they think they deserve a cookie for tolerating diversity, as long as it performs to their specific standards. It’s giving “I have a Black friend” energy, honestly.

Here’s the kicker: nobody makes these critiques of bad representation when it’s a group they see themselves in. Ever noticed how some the worst-written characters are often straight white dudes, but people still love them anyway? You’re telling me diversity has to be “done well” but you didn’t bat an eye when your favorite action hero couldn’t string together a coherent sentence and had all the personality of a wet sock. Or when the jaded smarmy self insert character only has snark and coffee going for them. 

What’s even more insidious about this whole mindset is how it pretends to be on the side of “good storytelling.” Like, people will say they’re against “forced diversity,” but what does that even mean? Why is diversity assumed to be artificial, but all-white casts just… natural? The problem isn’t the diversity. It’s that some people are so used to seeing stories centered on their experiences that anything outside of that feels wrong to them, even if they don’t realize it consciously.

There’s obviously some nuance to it. Like, let’s be real—context matters. If your story is set in, say, ancient Japan or medieval Iceland, no one’s expecting a wildly diverse cast. That’s fine. Authenticity to the setting is important, and it’s not about shoehorning diversity into places where it doesn’t make sense. But if your story is set in, say, modern-day New York City, a college campus, or even a sprawling futuristic metropolis, then yeah, we’re going to side-eye a lack of diversity. Those are spaces where people of all kinds coexist and have for a long time. So when creators act like the absence of diversity is just “natural” it feels more like a choice—a choice to ignore reality for the comfort of keeping certain audiences happy.

And that’s where the double standard really shows up. If a historical drama set in rural England has an all-white cast, it’s considered “accurate.” But if a fantasy world with dragons and magic includes Black characters or queer characters, suddenly it’s “politicalor “forced.” Make it make sense. The same people who demand historical accuracy in one breath will turn around and defend the complete erasure of diversity in contemporary or speculative settings where it absolutely belongs. You can’t have it both ways. 

At the end of the day, if you’re more likely to critique a story because it prominently features marginalized people, maybe you’re not as neutral about diversity as you think. And maybe, just maybe, the issue isn’t with how “well” the diversity is done—it’s with you. 

Anyway, rant over. I’d love to hear y’all’s thoughts. Have you run into this “I don’t mind diversity as long as it’s done well” argument, and how do you respond to it?

TL;DR:

The “I don’t mind diversity as long as it’s done well” argument is a thinly-veiled double standard. Diverse stories are held to higher scrutiny, while non-diverse ones are seen as the default and don’t need to “prove themselves.” Context matters—no one expects diversity in ancient Japan, but in places like modern NYC or speculative settings, the absence of diversity feels deliberate.

* Market Cap Milestone: The talk around town is that $PEIRO is gunning for a 100M market cap before 2026. Given the current trajectory, this isn't just wishful thinking. If you follow the money, the smart money is clearly seeing something here.

I know this is SweatyStartups, but I've been growing my equity based marketing company (we handle all your marketing for either a profit share or equity in your business), and I tested a different outreach method which I've seen solid success with, which I think can be tweaked to work for physical service businesses or any business type.

I did not invent this method, I actually first saw this on BHW about 10 years ago, and it involves...sending out physical mail. 

I live in a city with a population of around 500k, and I've identified a handful of local service industries which I have experience working with, and wanted to connect. In total I wrote down 100 businesses in my area which I believed would be a good fit for my partnership model.

Then for each individual business, I Google'd their main keyword (Ex: Pest Control in CITY), and I took a screen capture, I used SnagIt which allowed me to take a picture of the entire First page of Google.

With a sharpie I then highlighted where their business was ranking in Google, or if they weren't ranking on the first page at all. For example, if they were ranked 7th for the above keyword, I would highlight a red box around their website's position, outlining how far down the page they were. 

I also included a quick handwritten

I folded this into an envelope, and included my business card.

**Costs:**

**- \~$75 to ship all 100 letters.**

**- I already had envelopes, ink and paper, but add $10-$20 if you don't.**

**Looking at a total cost of around $100.**

**Results:** I currently have 5 coffee meetings in the next few weeks set up. I know this doesn't equate to any revenue until/if a deal is signed. But a 5% response (so far) on this, is miles better than the response rate I've been seeing on Cold Emailing. 

In a BHW thread where the poster talks about this method, he included something with some shape, I think he used Dice, to give the envelope some shape and make it more intriguing to the receiver. I'm sure there's some optimizations which could be made here to improve results further.

As mentioned, this might not be directly transferable to your businesses, but I do think there's something to spending a bit more time and adding a personal touch to your outreach, which sets you apart and hopefully gives you an edge in signing a new client/customer.

I never really thought about my water much.  But I tried TWW with RO/DI water, and it was a definite improvement when using beans from my local roaster.  Most of those are definitely roasted more towards medium on a vintage Jabez-Burns roaster.  So the extra acidity and pop was appreciated, and allowed me to find some fruit flavors to go with the sweetness and body.

It was such a change that I decided to try out a bunch of beans from top roasters that seem to be loved on this group.  And I went with Anaerobics and Co-Ferments.  just trying to see what I've been missing.

What I found was I struggled to enjoy most cups, because the acidity was just way too biting.  September, Dak, B&W, Rogue Wave, Proud Mary - all had this bright, citric acidity as the main note.  Now, all of them were also less than 2 weeks off roast (should have spread out some purchases...)- so I waited, and kept messing around trying to dial out the acidity.

Digging deeper into water chemistry, I came across a post in one of the espresso forums that talking about a genetic sensitivity to certain water chemistry 9which I've since not been able to find again)- it kind of made me think about the genetic disposition to either like or hate cilantro.

So instead of ordering more TWW as I was running low, I decided to order stuff to mix my own blends.  The ""holy water"" recipe seems to suit me pretty well, and I'm experimenting with a blend of Espon salt and Calcium chloride to balance brightness and body. It's kind of soft, so I may gradually bump up the hardness to see how I like it - or not.

My new pondering is whether I'll get similarly good cups from the local beans once I go through this crazy stash of beans I purchased.  

But, water does make a huge difference, and what one person finds to be ""good water"" may not fit your palate.  So it's worth exploring in search of a consistently great cup of coffee.",1,1732726677.0,pourover,1,0.67,False

So I currently live with my older sister, we both rented out an apartment for a whole year. I'm a student with a part-time job, she currently does nothing (no work/no school). First few months of living with her was fun until she started bringing certain friends around, they started to doing drugs. Mind you, we lost a sister to fentanyl last year and I am a recovering alcoholic and addict myself (five years clean). I got really bored of her watching do drugs so I started separating myself from her and picking up more shifts to avoid all of the stuff she does. One night she had a friend over, I told her that I was going straight to the room and they have a good night, and she made the most mockingly laugh ever, she says to her friend ""You see what I live with? a loser who only stays in her room!"". 

Her addiction is bothering me and its getting out of control, she lost a eight year friendship due to her accusing her friend of stealing money/drugs from her. Everyday she has a runny nose, and she's never the person to blow her nose but to keep sniffling. She has withdrawls that our brother witnessed as well, we did a sibling trip a month ago, which resulted with her being mad the entire trip. Which our brother replied, ""Is she withdrawling right now, why is she blaming me for her spilling coffee on me?"" 

  
She stopped going to her tattoo artist because he told her something along the lines, ""I can tell who has allergies or who does drugs"" or whatever.

I placed by Jesus picture, as I call it, above instead but I wonder if the gold is clashing with the black stone a little?

 We thought about getting the Castlery sloane media cabinet and putting it straight across from the couch on this blank wall (picture #6). I wanted to place the two chairs side by side and do ottomans on the side where the window and fireplace are but husband likes it like this. Our Christmas tree is going in front of that window and I feel the chair blocks the view. 

I don't like the red brown hies of our coffee table and side tables and thinking of doing black and a rich rustic brown combo instead. The floors are a wood looking tile but definitely gray and I think those colors would look better.

Lastly, I'm trying to figure out what to do with the partial Wall next to the breakfast bar. I want to remove the console and maybe do a mini gallery wall and a small bench or table for our Google home.

My question is why coffee grounds but not tea bags?

The only thing I can think of is that with coffee, I still have to buy a paper filter which is not covered by SNAP, whereas the tea bag comes with a built-in filter.

I’ll be there early Thursday to late Sunday, near the Mag Mile (Knickerbocker hotel).

I’m basically looking for a mix of mainstream shopping in Mag Mile and Gold Coast areas, and spending time out in the neighborhoods.

A couple of specific things I want are a specialty liquor store for things I can’t get in Canada (leaning Binny’s) and an Italian or other type of upscale market to buy obscure tinned seafood. Also a central market type thing too (I think there’s a Christmas market going on I may look at).

Here’s the food research so far. I basically need some help grouping by geography and in a way that makes sense to do on the same day. I realize this may feel a bit one dimensional but we have a great multi cultural food scene where I am from so it’s not a high travel priority for me.

One key dinner I want is somewhere with a classic old school Chicago feel. I’ve looked at La Scarola but heard the service concerns. Others that have come up are Mart Anthony, ignotz, All vita, Elina’s, Formento’s, rose Mary? I am probably leaning to Mart Anthony.

When I tried to start the car, nothing happened. There was no cranking or clicking sound—nothing at all. However, I could roll down the windows, listen to the radio, and turn on the lights, so the battery seemed fine (it was replaced just a few weeks ago).

I didn't have time to deal with it then, so I left it alone and tried again in the evening. To my surprise, it started normally. The next day, everything was fine—the car started and drove without issues.

Two days later, I started the car, drove to a coffee shop, spent about an hour there, and when I got back into the car, it wouldn't start again. This time I called roadside assistance. They checked the voltage, which was fine, so it didn't seem like a battery issue. We even tried push-starting it, but that didn't work either.

At this point, I suspected the starter had failed, so I called a towing service and had the car taken to a mechanic to check the starter. Strangely, the next day, the mechanic tried to start the car, and it started just fine. He gave the car back to me, thinking everything was okay.

I drove it home, turned it off, and now it won't start again—no cranking or clicking, just nothing.

One thing to add: The car recently had the ABS/ASC module replaced by a relatively inexperienced mechanic. Could it be that the wiring wasn't connected properly or that something related to the replacement is causing this issue?

I'd really appreciate any insights or advice, as I'm at a loss for what could be wrong.

1h18lp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1h18lp1/am_i_unhappy_or_is_this_just_life/,Am I unhappy or is this just life?,"Throwaway account.

I (36F) met my now-husband (42M) in early 2020 right before the pandemic.

Anyway, when I first met my husband I fell in love with him quickly. I knew there was something good there. We had great sexual chemistry, and he was so kind and loving.

The pandemic then hit about 6 weeks into us dating. It kind of ruined our honeymoon phase. He was suddenly the only person I could hang out with. We lived separately, but he would come over one night during the week and stay all weekend.

The relationship lost that early excitement and luster, however I noticed that I always looked forward to him coming over, and never felt the desire for him to leave. For me, this is huge. If I start to not be romantically interested in someone, I become REPULSED and want to be alone.

Anyway, obviously life was not that exciting in general throughout the pandemic years. 

2.5 years in we decided to get married and move in together.

Overall, I shouldn't have much to complain about. 

Things that are good:

He's the most loving, supportive, kind person I've ever met. He is truly an equal partner, treats me with respect. We share the same values and have similar perspectives of the world. We communicate well, enjoy a lot of the same intellectual interests (arts, film, etc). He is a wildly talented artist, which is something I have so much awe and respect for, and love being with someone who is so openminded, creative. He is emotionally expansive and experiences the world deeply. 

I can be 100% myself around him -- he doesn't ever judge me and appreciates my quirks. He will be an incredible father and co-parent. I was on the fence, but decided last year that I do want to become a parent, and I have zero worries about him being anything other than brilliant at parenthood.

  
Things that are not good (and that I'm struggling with):

He is SO much more introverted than I even thought. The pandemic is over, and wow he really does not care to socialize. Or really do anything other than make art at home all day. If I want to go do something, he will gladly come and won't complain. But it doesn't feel like he enjoys it, even if he says he does. There is not that spark of excitement and energy. 

There are things, for instance, that I would go to and just feel so energized by and excited about. When I do these same things with him, they feel duller sometimes. Maybe not \*more\* dull, but at best his presence doesn't add much for me energy-wise. I still feel the desire to share experiences with him, because he's my person.

But when I step back, I think about two other significant relationships in my life and how different it was. My boyfriend in my early 20s was just higher energy and we'd have so much FUN. We'd be buzzing after having shared experiences in the world. His zest would multiple mine. This is similar to a close best friend I had and lived with -- her energy would amp mine up and make experiences feel even more exciting and engaging.

In the same vein, he really is not social. He will come to social events and stand alone in a corner. People will talk to him and I'll be excited to see him talking to people. But after we leave -- when I ask about the people he talked to -- he is like ""yeah whatever,"" and expresses disinterest in those people. He is close with his siblings (who live in another country), but they are the only people other than me I've seen him actually be interested in and care about. 

While I'm somewhat introverted, it's extremely important to me to have healthy friendships and community.  And that just feels more and more difficult as we age. It's really hard to maintain a healthy social life alone. Having a partner who is more socially-engaged would really make a difference.

Also, he gave off the impression that he was more active/adventurous than he is. He used to bike a ton. Being physically active is important to me. I'm not a fitness/outdoors adventure fanatic, but it is still a part of life that is important. If I come across an opportunity to go skating or parasailing or surfing or paddle boarding or any other cool activity, I'm on it. 

In our dating years, he was more likely to jump in on an activity with me. Nowadays, he has no interest in these things and in fact has revealed he kind of hates them. He doesn't want to try any physical activities in fear of getting hurt or heights or whatever. 

He doesn't exercise at all. I like his body as it is -- it's not about weight or appearance. I just come from a family that highly valued exercise as an important part of life. I worry about his mobility in the future, because I want to be an active person as I age. 

Lastly, he has issues with body odor that are hard to pinpoint. Sometimes he doesn't smell, but he is prone to halitosis and other odors. The smells also change, so I don't know what they are. Last year he had this gross smell coming off of him for a while. I made him go to the dermatologist for a mole check, and it turned out he had a skin fungus on his chest. So, it seemed like that was the culprit, as it went away when he used the medication.

But this morning, for instance, I woke up and couldn't even be near him -- he reeked of this other weird smell that was so pungent. I've been urging him to go to the doctor for a physical exam (which he hasn't done in forever). Maybe there is some health issue? Hopefully minor and easy to address.

I think the smells might be a result of him not drinking enough water, drinking too much coffee, and not exercising ever so that he sweats things out properly? His diet is fine. 

But these odors complicate our intimacy and sex life. When we do have sex, it is enjoyable and good. It's just hard to have a fantastic sex life when he sometimes smells horrible. I know that I can't just go and kiss him in the middle of the day, because he has probably been drinking coffee, no water, might have not brushed his teeth yet, and his breath will likely be putrid.

  
Anyway, I go really off-and-on with my satisfaction in our life and marriage. I know I ranted about the negative things more here, but that's because they are top of mind today. Most of the time, I am content. Then randomly I will have days where I feel unhappy and the incompatibilities will really bother me.

I was single throughout most of my 20s into my early 30s. I have dated probably hundreds of people, and was super against ""settling"" for anyone. If I wasn't into someone, I was repulsed by them and wanted them out of my life. 

So I KNOW we have something special, and maybe I am taking the good things for granted. Maybe it's my fault that I'm not happy with my social life -- honestly, I felt my social life lacking even before I met him. Perhaps it's unfair to put this all on him. 

Whenever I get like how I am today -- thinking of all the negatives -- I am convinced that I always feel this way and just bury it. But I know that I don't always feel this way, otherwise I would have left the marriage.

I just don't know if I'm happy. Is this just the reality of being an adult human? 

If I left the marriage, I don't know that I'd be happier. While some of the other people I dated had the things he lacks, they also lacked things he does have to offer -- unconditional love, stability, support, trust, shared values, kindness, intellect, integrity. I've never felt so able to be my full with anyone else in the world. I don't think there's anyone I've ever been able to trust as much as I do him. These are not small things, obviously. And I don't know that I would be able to find them again. 

Still, I feel envious when people say their partner is perfect for them.

Or when they say they have amazing physical/sexual chemistry -- I know what they mean because I've had that with other people. My husband and I don't have BAD sexual chemistry, but it's not the best I've had. And clearly things did not work out with the people I had amazing sexual chemistry with.

- Already over-visited (if I see Charminar one more time, I might just become part of its architecture 💀),
- Super generic (yay, another cafe with overpriced coffee and the same aesthetic neon sign 🙄), or
- Cringe couple central (seriously, can y’all NOT block every cute spot with your lovey-dovey vibes? Some of us are just trying to vibe with our squad 😭).

Where’s the fun stuff? Where are the hidden gems? I don’t need something fancy—just give me something underrated, unique, and not packed with people pretending they’re influencers. Are there fun activities, chill parks, quirky eateries, secret spots, or ANYTHING where friends can just have a good time without spending our whole budget on entry fees?

Hyderabad is such a big city, but it feels like all the good spots are either taken over or unknown. If you’re a local legend who knows some secret hangouts, drop them in the comments and save us from another weekend of awkwardly sitting around at the same old mall.

Great luck day so I figured, time to hit the Skull Cavern. Took my coffees, a couple spicy eels, lots of bombs and my lucky ring (which I've had since fall year 1) I arrived super early and my run started slow but after floor 10 I was dropping down holes by 8-13 floors at a time. By 8:00pm I was 15 floors away from floor 100. I had hundreds of iridium and other valuables. When suddenly, for some f'd up reason, Minecraft decided to open the launcher for an update on its own. Somehow, this closed my game, losing me all of my progress. I'm pissed off and sad! Im not very skilled in Skull Cavern runs but I was flowing like a pro! 😭 I wish I get the same luck today when I play again because Im lacking lots of iridium and I was making up for it.

1h18gdt,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1h18gdt/i_feel_like_i_cant_leave/,I feel like I can’t leave,"Me and my ex were together for 3 years. After months of domestic abuse abuse therapy I realized he was abusive the whole time. 

We got together when I was at a really low point mentally, before I had access to therapy and medication as I was suffering from PTSD from previous abuse. He was so sweet at first. It was supposed to be just a random impulsive hookup that somehow lead to us essentially living together for a week. He walked across campus to my dorm every day to bring me coffee and was so emotionally supportive and i’d never experienced anything like that before.

The first time I remember him hitting me was a month in. I stayed because we had been engaging in rough sex/bdsm type stuff and the lines got blurred between what was okay and what wasn’t- and I thought it was my fault for allowing it in some contexts but not others. He did it after I threatened to leave him and then initiated sex so he could claim it was sexual rather than out of violence. This happened multiple times throughout our relationship and eventually lead to him sexually assaulting me while I was blackout drunk- which I also blamed myself for. What was worse was the emotional abuse. He would call me names and yell at me and slam doors and then claim he wasn’t yelling at me and that I was the one that was actually abusive and I believed that for a long time. 

I never imagined leaving him things started getting really bad in October of last year. We fought constantly but I wasn’t fighting back. It was just him flipping out and threatening to kill himself if I didn’t do everything he said. He had cut me off from all my friends and I had no one so I stayed and at this point I believed his lies so deeply that when I went to my first therapy session to deal with what I thought was PTSD from previous relationships- I told my therapist I was an abuser.

On February 12th he walked into my house freaking out- going on a rant in front of all my roommates about all kinds of things and eventually started telling them about how he sexually assaulted me while I begged him to stop. He was telling everyone about how he was the victim in that situation and when no one took his side he started crying and yelling at me. I just sat there and took it. I was so tired. My roomates kicked him out and he sent me 72 messages calling me all kinds of names and then called me and broke up with me. All I said was okay. He harassed me for the next 48 hours and all I said in response was that he needed to get help and I would be there for him when he was ready because I honestly thought he was just mentally ill.

I got a call from his mom on the 13th that he was in the ER for mental health reasons.

On February 14th I had my first real therapy session. It was the anniversary of me being raped 4 years prior. We ended up talking about our breakup and she brought up the idea of him being abusive. When I left he was standing outside with flowers, asking to take me out for valentines day. He showed me his prescription for anti-depressants and apologized and all the baristas at the cafe kept telling me how he was a keeper and how cute the flowers were and I started crying. We left and he started yelling at me, accusing me of abusing him, threatening to kill himself, accusing me of sexually assaulting him etc. We got into the biggest fight of our relationship in the middle of the street while all out neighbours watched. I balled my eyes out and have never felt pain like that. I begged and pleaded with him and he threw his hot coffee at me and then said i threw it on myself.

I went no contact. He showed up at my house for days banging on the door, sending me violent text messages etc.

My roommates were so incredibly supportive. This was the worst period of my life, like I really can’t even put it into words. He kept attacking me, but I felt relief for the first time in years. I started hooking up with someone new, and I got my friends back and I was going out with the girls and it was the happiest i’ve ever felt I think. 

And then I got a call from the hospital that he had been admitted to the schizophrenia psych ward and I was his emergency contact. I showed up and he was rocking back and forth and mumbling nonsense. Calling me by different names, totally out of it. It hurt me so much to see him like that and I was all he had so I spent the next 30 days visiting and taking care of him. After the first couple days the abuse was back but I excused all of it because he was sick.

And then one of the nurses told me he wasn’t schizophrenic. She said he only acted like that in front of me. The social worker told me he was abusive and I needed to leave. 

I stopped going, and things got better for a minute. The new guy I was seeing was perfect.

When he got his release date I went in one more time and told him we were done for good. I kept no contact for a while and then I left my new partner as well. My new partner proceeded to rape and strangle me. I ended up in the hospital and my ex was my emergency contact. I went back to him. I moved back in with my parents while I was out of school for the summer and we stayed in contact. He hit me again and the emotional abuse started so I went no contact again. I was moving into a new house and had to replace everything and I wanted to start fresh and be able to sleep in a bed and be in a space that he had never touched.

Things started getting bad and we started talking again around halloween. Hes been so nice to me and I know its just an act to get me back but part of me thinks maybe he was just sick and now hes better- or that hes changed. I went through all of my savings because I couldn’t work for the summer while I was recovering from my assault- or for the 30 days I was caring for him and i’ve been struggling alot financially and he’s been sending me money- and now I don’t know how to cut ties because I don’t want him to think I was just using him for money. Hes already defamed me across the whole school and I don’t need it to get worse. I’ve lost alot of my support systems again and I’m trying my best but its so hard to leave and i’m starting to think if I havent left at this point I never will. Its especially hard because he’s being so nice to me now. Part of me wishes he would do something so I would feel like I had a reason.

I know this is long, I just needed to rant and I really don’t know what to do, I cant even talk to anyone about it because they all think i’ve left for good and they’re getting tired of me going back and I really don’t blame them. ",2,1732725306.0,abusiverelationships,2,1.0,False

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement. I also drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

I have a big imagination and love talking about the weirdest hypotheticals. My sense of humour is pretty dry and a bit on the darker side, a product of having studied in the UK I suppose. I don’t laugh very often, but when I do sometimes I’ll have trouble breathing. 

I’m looking to meet someone that I can hopefully fall in love with. I want to meet in real life as well, so it’s a big plus if you’re somewhat close to me. 

So let’s get to know each other. Let’s talk about our lives, our hobbies, our dreams, and everything in between. If you can’t think of a good message, which believe me I understand, tell me what you would do in a zombie apocalypse. Hope to hear from you. ",1,1732724590.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement. I also drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

1h181rq,https://www.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/1h181rq/isaac_asimov_and_arthur_c_clarkes_predictions/,Isaac Asimov and Arthur C Clarke's predictions about what the world would look like in 50 years,"Over 50 years ago, Asimov made these predictions about our world today:

1. “Gadgetry will continue to relieve mankind of tedious jobs. Kitchen units will be devised that will prepare ‘automeals,’ heating water and converting it to coffee; toasting bread; frying, poaching or scrambling eggs, grilling bacon, and so on. Breakfasts will be ‘ordered’ the night before to be ready by a specified hour the next morning.”

2. “Communications will become sight-sound and you will see as well as hear the person you telephone. The screen can be used not only to see the people you call but also for studying documents and photographs and reading passages from books. Synchronous satellites, hovering in space will make it possible for you to direct-dial any spot on earth, including the weather stations in Antarctica.”

3. “[M]en will continue to withdraw from nature in order to create an environment that will suit them better. By 2014, electroluminescent panels will be in common use. Ceilings and walls will glow softly, and in a variety of colors that will change at the touch of a push button.”

4. “Robots will neither be common nor very good in 2014, but they will be in existence.”

5. “The appliances of 2014 will have no electric cords, of course, for they will be powered by long- lived batteries running on radioisotopes.”

6. “[H]ighways … in the more advanced sections of the world will have passed their peak in 2014; there will be increasing emphasis on transportation that makes the least possible contact with the surface. There will be aircraft, of course, but even ground travel will increasingly take to the air a foot or two off the ground.”

7. ""Vehicles with ‘Robot-brains’ … can be set for particular destinations … that will then proceed there without interference by the slow reflexes of a human driver.”

8. “Wall screens will have replaced the ordinary set; but transparent cubes will be making their appearance in which three-dimensional viewing will be possible.”

9. “The world population will be 6,500,000,000 and the population of the United States will be 350,000,000.” [...if the population growth continues unchecked...] “All earth will be a single choked Manhattan by A.D. 2450 and society will collapse long before that! [...] There will, therefore, be a worldwide propaganda drive in favor of birth control by rational and humane methods and, by 2014, it will undoubtedly have taken serious effect.”

10. “Ordinary agriculture will keep up with great difficulty and there will be ‘farms’ turning to the more efficient micro-organisms. Processed yeast and algae products will be available in a variety of flavors.”

11. “The world of A.D. 2014 will have few routine jobs that cannot be done better by some machine than by any human being. Mankind will therefore have become largely a race of machine tenders. Schools will have to be oriented in this direction. [...] All the high-school students will be taught the fundamentals of computer technology will become proficient in binary arithmetic and will be trained to perfection in the use of the computer languages that will have developed out of those like the contemporary “Fortran.”

12. “Mankind will suffer badly from the disease of boredom, a disease spreading more widely each year and growing in intensity. This will have serious mental, emotional and sociological consequences, and I dare say that psychiatry will be far and away the most important medical specialty in 2014.”

13. “The most glorious single word in the vocabulary will have become work!” in our “a society of enforced leisure.”

And here are Arthur C Clarke's predictions, given in 1964:

""We could be in instant contact with each other, wherever we may be, where we can contact our friends anywhere on earth, even if we don’t know their actual physical location. It will be possible in that age, perhaps only 50 years from now, for a man to conduct his business from Tahiti or Bali just as well as he could from London.… Almost any executive skill, any administrative skill, even any physical skill, could be made independent of distance. I am perfectly serious when I suggest that one day we may have brain surgeons in Edinburgh operating on patients in New Zealand. When that time comes, the whole world will have shrunk to a point, and the traditional role of the city will cease to make sense. Men will no longer commute, they will communicate. They won't have to travel for business anymore, they'll only travel for pleasure.""",38,1732724259.0,printSF,11,0.98,False

We all went to the same school, but L ended up leaving and going to a better school in the area because she wanted to. Z, L and I formed a small trio and became very close over the summer. Naturally L wants to see us, so once every 2 or 3 weeks she texts us and asks if we want to go out for a coffee after school or go out for lunch. I am pretty much always free when she texts as I do my work during the week and only really go out Fridays after school and Saturdays. 

On the other hand, Z has a boyfriend out of school, R (17m). Z is always stressing about workload as she sees her boyfriend 2-3 times a week, so as a result, tells L that she can't go out with her. It's now been around 6 weeks since Z and L went out or saw each other.

Today, Z was complaining to me because L texted her to go out again and she got upset at the fact that Z told her she was busy once again. Z was saying that her boyfriend is a bigger priority than L (and her friends in general) because she knows she can maintain a friendship with L and she was the one who chose to move schools so it's her problem that we don't see her frequently anymore, but I can't help but wonder if I can get myself to agree with her on that.
