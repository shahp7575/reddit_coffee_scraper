Although I've made a few new friendships since moving here, I have noticed a recurring issue of women who are just plain flaky. They are lovely people, and I would like to maintain a friendship, but they are not reliable when it comes to making plans. I suppose my problem is twofold...I am a planner and will often reach out to my friends to schedule a hangout. But I don't get the same energy back when it comes to either 1) them proactively initiating plans with me or 2) flaking on plans we've already made. Honestly, it hurts my feelings, but I don't know how to express that. Should I just move on from these friends, or is there a productive way to have a conversation about this?

That doesn’t mean they like them any less, they just know the correct steps for a powerful mindset shift that immediately gets them over anyone no matter how long they’ve been together.

I am going to share with you a 3-step strategy that took me from wanting to end my life to wanting to live my life in only 2 weeks.

Not only that, but I will also provide you with actionable steps you can take to ensure this works for you. The only thing I ask is that you watch until the end because you must use all three steps in to get over someone in record time.

*\*\*If you’re interested in working with me, please* [***click the link***](https://www.liinks.co/elliotscott) *here.\*\**

# Step One: Your Acceptance Speech

This is the most cliché step, but also the most crucial, as it sets up the groundwork for the mindset shift. And that’s acceptance. Specifically, accepting you’re going to be on this Earth but not together.

I know this isn't easy. If you’re anything like me, your brain doesn’t shut up and listen. It likes to constantly ask, “What ifs:”

* *What if I was the problem?*
* *What if I wasn’t good enough?*
* *What if I didn’t do X or what if I did Y instead?*

The easiest way to overcome this is to brush aside all the “what-ifs” and accept complete responsibility. That means:

* *Were you the problem?* Who cares. You have to take responsibility for YOUR part.
* Were you good enough? Who cares improve yourself anyway.
* What if I did/didn’t do XYZ? Who cares. You probably screwed up. Focus on the future.

>Dating is a game of trial and error. Please don’t beat yourself up for something inevitable.

After taking full responsibility, the next thing that helps me accept the outcome is being empathetic. This means telling yourself that “If her version of happiness doesn’t have me in it, who am I to rob that of her for my selfish gain? Do I want to be with someone who doesn’t want to be with me?”

Is this going to hurt? You bet your sweet ass it will.

I remember trying to do this and constantly getting stuck on the fact that I wasn’t good enough and because of it, she’s with some other guy who is satisfying her and her sugarwalls.

What made it worse was how pathetic I felt. I was lying in my grandma’s basement crying myself to sleep.

It’s so much easier to accept the fact you’re not going to be together and then add the cherry on top by saying, “As long as they’re happy, I can now set off and do my own thing.”

It’s like that saying, “Holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die.”

I just wanted to let go completely because it gave me a definitive path to explore. Let me explain:

Let’s say you’re sick and go to the doctor. The doctor takes one look at you and is like, “Oh damn, you’ve seen better days.” “yeah no shit doc. What’s wrong with me?”

It’s very defeating if you go to the doctor, they run some tests, and still don’t know what’s wrong with you. Even if it’s bad news, it’s better to understand and to have a set plan of action than to sit around and try to figure it out.

I had reached the point where I was so exhausted that I just wanted to move on. I didn’t want to fight it anymore.

# Step Two: The Eye Of The Tornado

The problem I had was that my mind was racing. I remember the first time I saw her after we split up. She had to come over for some reason. She pulled up and got out of the car. She looked amazing while I had raccoon eyes from the constant tears and sleepless nights.

She had her hair done with highlights, it was all flared out. She had this new outfit that hugged her body in all the right places. Her makeup was done. What hurt was that it required more effort than she ever put into me. She was going out that night. Come to find out, she had a date.

My mind started racing. I knew they were going to attend the bedroom Olympics, where she was gonna attempt the pole vault and he was going to run a marathon if you know what I mean. Dude coming out here looking like Steve Prefontaine with that kitty tickler mustache.

I still had vivid images of her, so I knew exactly what he would see. The only thing that went through my head that entire night was the act of them making love. I imagined every little detail: her body, breathing, moaning, the things she liked, and so on. It killed me inside. All while I was again, laying in my grandma’s basement.

I tried masking the pain, covering it up, and distracting myself. It wasn’t working. She was the first thing I thought about when I woke up and the last thing I thought about before bed. That’s when it would sneak in.

It wasn’t until I took a deep breath, laid back, and let all those thoughts happen: them screwing, us never being together, what she was up to, did she ever think about me, them ending up getting married, and so on. EVERYTHING.

Then I realized something, “This IS the worst case scenario. I am face deep into some dogshit yet still alive. It can only get better from here.

I call this the eye of the tornado because it’s hectic on the outside but when you’re in the middle of it, you see everything for what it is. You’re the front line and still alive.

What I am getting at is, stop running from it. Face your demons head-on. Let it consume you. Challenge it. You’ll still be standing. You will get over it much faster, knowing you can do so instead of always running.

# Step Three: Change Your Environment

I think this is the hardest because some of us can’t do this, whether you work with the person, live with them, or they’re part of the same friend group. I understand that, but you need to change something up in your routine.

>The brain loves routine, and it subconsciously anchors our thoughts to it.

For me, I changed everything. I dropped out of college, joined another, quit my job, changed my circle of friends, and deleted 90% of my social media contacts. Everything changed. Dramatic? Yes. Did it help? 100%

It’s tough to see growth and improvement when everything around you is the same: Waking up the same time every day, ordering the same coffee from Starbucks, parking in the same spot at work/school, doing the same mundane task, oh, and then you see him….great….

I love drastic changes but if you can’t do that, try some substitute without ending anything. For example, If you have the same friend group, keep your friends but find a new group too. A group that you can rely on instead of thinking, *“Oh I wanna hang with Judy but John will be there.”*

Man fuck John.

If you have a job, ask to be moved, work in a different area of the job, or, at best, create boundaries with him that help you mentally.

The goal is to tell the brain that there is more to life than what you’ve been living. As soon as the brain realizes this, it’s easier to step out of your bubble and feel excited for growth.

# I Was Free Again!

I thought I could never get over her. I remember the first day I felt free:

I usually wake up in a very stressed state from the night before, and my brain just immediately floods me with thoughts of her that I can’t escape. This time I woke up, I lay there waiting for them, but they never came. It was weird, but I just thought they’d eventually come later. I remember later that day I was driving the backroads to go to a friend’s house. It was summertime and humid. In Illinois, the summers are very hot and humid. Not fun. While driving there, my car broke down. I pull to the side of the road and grab my cell. No service. I sit there for a second, trying to get service before I get out of the car, because it feels like an oven. I spot a tree to my left that offers some shade. I walk over there while looking at my phone. Still no service. I start to laugh. For some reason, I wasn’t mad. I was happy. This was nothing to the pain I have been feeling for the last 7 months, and despite what’s happening, she never popped into my mind. I was content with being stranded on the side of the road. I was happy. I was going to be ok.

1kze1n2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1kze1n2/red_leads/,Red leads.,"The office stank of copper and mildew.

Three desks, one busted coffee machine, a fan that turned but never cooled. Fluorescent lights flickered like nervous pupils. The blinds were always shut, even during the day.

The door clicked. In walked Carver—gray suit, sweat stains, and breath like raw meat. He slumped into his chair and stared at the red folder in the center of his desk.

“Don’t open it,” muttered Higgins, hunched over a ledger like it owed him money. His skin was paper-thin, and every time he looked up, his eyes seemed further sunken.

Carver didn’t listen. He opened the folder.

A photo. A family of five. Newly moved into a place off Maple Street. The kids were young. The parents smiled too wide. Carver blinked, then shut the folder.

“I said don’t open it.”

“It’s mine, isn’t it? The red leads are for closers.”

“Red leads are for feeders,” Higgins snapped, coughing into a rag. The cloth came away dark. “They don’t want insurance. They want absolution. They think if they sign, they’re safe.”

“They’re not?”

Higgins didn’t answer.


---

They used to sell normal policies. Back when the world was simpler. Car accidents, burglaries, flood damage. Then the new buyers came in—after the Black Dawn. After the creatures started buying up land. Legally. Like gentlemen.

Now, the policies were different. Bloodline transfers. Sunlight clauses. Feeding rotations.

Vampires didn’t want to be monsters anymore. They wanted to be homeowners. And homeowners wanted protection. That’s where Carver and the others came in.


---

“Gentlemen!”

The door slammed. A gust of frigid air filled the room. Arthur Quinn—district manager, top closer, mouth full of glass and charm—strolled in with a coat made of something that might have once breathed.

Behind him, two assistants wheeled in a black case.

“I’ve got news,” Quinn said, voice like a knife dipped in wine. “Big changes. Corporate’s merging us with the real estate branch. New quotas. New incentives. New blood.”

“Jesus,” muttered Morales from the corner, clutching a cup of cold coffee like a rosary.

Quinn grinned. “Don’t bring Him into this.”

The assistants opened the case. Inside, two folders. One red. One black.

“These,” Quinn said, tapping the folders, “are your salvation or your damnation. The red folder goes to the man who closes tonight. The black folder? Well, that’s for whoever can’t make quota. You know the rules.”

“I haven’t had a real lead in weeks,” Higgins said. “All I get are paranoid zealots and cryptkeepers too broke to even bury themselves.”

“Then sell harder. The hunger is real. Our clients don’t wait.”

“What’s in the black folder?” Carver asked.

Quinn leaned close, his breath like smoke and copper. “Names. Yours, if you fail. You think the vampires just want policies? They want structure. You think we’re salesmen? We’re curators of livestock. And they’re getting tired of grazing on junk.”

Quinn stood. “Close a red lead, or you’re the next premium.”


---

Carver drove to Maple Street at dusk.

The house was too normal. Lawn trimmed. Curtains drawn. A tire swing in the front yard. The family was waiting at the door.

Mrs. Aldridge welcomed him with a smile that didn’t reach her eyes. The kids stared, silent. Mr. Aldridge shook his hand with fingers cold as marble.

Inside, the walls were bare. No photos. No dust.

“We read the brochure,” Mr. Aldridge said. “We want the Gold Package.”

Carver blinked. “You… do?”

“Bi-weekly protection,” the wife said. “Ceremonial deterrents. Sacred clause backup. Even the safe room install.”

Carver opened his briefcase, hands trembling. “You understand this isn’t… guaranteed protection. It’s managed risk.”

“We’ve seen what happens without it,” Mr. Aldridge said. “We watched our neighbor’s kid get peeled open on his porch like a fruit.”

The silence stretched.

“You can keep our daughter on the rotation list,” Mrs. Aldridge said quietly. “She’s young. They like that.”

Carver paused. “You’re offering her?”

“She won’t feel a thing. We heard they’re cleaner now. Gentle.”

The girl, maybe eight, sat on the stairs. She didn’t speak. Didn’t cry.

Carver signed the forms. They smiled. He left the house and vomited in the bushes.


---

Back at the office, he dropped the signed folder on Quinn’s desk.

“You did it,” Quinn said, flipping through the papers. “Mr. Carver, you’ve finally closed a red lead.”

Carver wiped his mouth. “They offered their daughter.”

“Yes. And you accepted.”

“They were calm. Like they knew it was inevitable.”

Quinn smiled. “It is.”

“What happens if I stop? If I walk away?”

Quinn’s eyes gleamed. “You know the answer to that.”

“I’m not like you,” Carver whispered.

“No,” Quinn said, leaning close. “But you’re like them. That’s why you’re valuable. You still pretend this job is about paperwork and premiums. But every contract you sign? It feeds the system. And the system feeds them.”

Quinn pushed the black folder forward. “You want out? Take this to Higgins. He didn’t close. You just bumped him down the ladder.”

Carver stared at the folder. Then took it.


---

Higgins was gone the next morning.

No note. No noise. Just a bloodstain near his desk and his ledger, closed.

The fan still turned. The coffee still didn’t work. The blinds stayed shut.

Carver sat down. There was a new red folder on his desk.

He didn’t open it right away.

But he would.

They always did.",1,1748635605.0,stories,0,1.0,False
1kze0xc,https://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/1kze0xc/what_makes_you_finally_speak_out_dark_side_of_the/,What makes you finally speak out? + dark side of the INFP,"Trigger warning...

I tend to keep my opinions to myself, especially in work meetings or political discussions. Honestly, I just don’t care to get involved and prefer to save my energy for my hobbies and loved ones. But there’s one thing I absolutely cannot stand: manipulative, gaslighting, and abusive people who continually cross boundaries, even when you’ve shown them empathy. Once my patience is drained and I see their true colors, something in my brain just flips. I suddenly feel this intense urge to get back at them and make them regret it all.

As INFPs, we’re really good at reading people. We can see what makes other people happy, what drives them, and even what hurts them the most. We usually use this gift for good, to be empathetic toward our friends and family and see the best in people. But once I hit a certain threshold, my patience and empathy just fully disappears.

This darker side of me has shown up twice so far in my life. The first time was with a guy I dated shortly. He lied about his entire life and was abusing his ex-girlfriend severely, like forcing peanuts into her mouth even though she had a deadly allergy. He was cheating on her with me, and I had no idea. When I found out through a good friend of mine and others, I called him up and fully unloaded on him. I said everything that made him snap, and he went into a full-blown rage, something I’d never seen from him before. He’d always been calm and composed, but in that moment, he completely lost it and showed his true personality.

The second time was with my boyfriend’s ex. My boyfriend is genuinely one of the kindest people I know, but when they were together, she completely took advantage of his naivety and kindness, constantly berating him, even in front of his family and friends. She possibly cheated on him too while on exchange abroad. After they broke up, she kept lurking around like a ghost. She stalked my Instagram stories for more than half a year straight and would randomly show up at the coffee shop he worked at. It was beyond uncomfortable.

At first, I tried being patient with her. I called her out in a calm, measured way, hoping she’d show understanding or at least some sort of honesty that she didn't want to talk it out, but she always deflected and manipulated the situation. She’d tell our mutual that she can talk it out later, but she never did. After months of this nonsense, I was tired. I sent her a message, letting her know I didn’t trust her anymore, that I’d wasted my time being patient, and that her behavior was very questionable. 

I waited a full year for a response, and when she finally replied, she gaslit me hard. She claimed I was the one making things awkward, that it was my fault I couldn't move on. It was infuriating. I wanted to tear into her, say everything I knew about her life, things that could hurt her deeply. But I didn’t. Instead, I sent one final message, calling her out for all the gaslighting and manipulative behavior, and told her I wouldn’t tolerate it anymore as she lives in the same small city as me and my boyfriend.

I won’t lie, sometimes I worry about myself. I know I have the ability to make people cry, to make them question everything they believe. It’s a power I try not to misuse, but when I reach my limit, I can’t ignore that side of me. 

Anyway, if you've read it so far, please share your own story when you finally snapped into your dark side. ",1,1748635554.0,infp,0,1.0,False

# Blurb:

In this world, international mining operations in the Arctic continued well past the turn of the millennia, resulting in the creation of the deepest and most expansive man-made borehole to ever exist. As of right now, it reaches a depth of 14.992 kilometers below sea level. At 4:13am UTC today, humanity will reach its 15th kilometer.

To celebrate this milestone, humanity will uncover a virus.

Our patient zero will wake up in the morning for work. She will make coffee, make rounds outside in the Arctic cold, call her mother, and water the succulents she keeps in her office. She will examine this virus, contract it, and cough and sputter blood and scream and cry and pray as her brain bloats and bruises against the inside of her skull. 

She is Canadian, and will wish to be buried on Canadian soil.

\---

We begin as 5 survivors who've found each other in pre-apocalypse Canada. Depending on your answers to the form attached above, I'll decide where in irl present day Canada I want to put you. I'll have this decided before session 0, which will give you guys some time to brainstorm your pc backgrounds! We'll use **Roll 20**, and I'll use **Google Maps** as a reference for the background layouts. Also, there's a huge overarching plot and I'll leave you guys threads all over the place, but it's your choice whether or not you want to follow it. There's always some other sucker that's gonna take up the mantle, right?

For custom stuff, I've categorized buildings so that loot isn't completely randomized (looting was the biggest issue I had with DnZ). We'll also use progress clocks (like in Blades in the Dark). There's no magic (sorry), and the classes in DnZ are really different from regular 5e. We also won't be using a majority of the Last of Us inspired zombies found in the DnZ GM manual (I have custom ones). Otherwise, we'll follow the DnZ book for everything else.

I’m not shilling for this company, just a happy long-time customer. I’ve purchased a cross body bag, key chain clip,
two mini trucker wallets, phone case, watch band and now this travel case/dopp case. 

I believe they deserve a BIFL status, although obviously I haven’t had my pieces for my entire life. They have a guarantee for the life of the piece with regard to defects and workmanship. 

Their ethos is over-engineering stuff. And it’s true, more rivets than needed, thick stitching, quality hardware and 5-6 and 9-10 oz hides, depending on the piece. They use only full grain. 

I’ve been really happy with my trucker wallets. They’ve been my daily carry since 2017. One of them came very soft, I guess maybe from the belly, and it’s almost too oily. They made it right and sent me another one, and let me keep the first. I’m still using the first one as my daily carry.

I am not a lawyer or a copyright expert. Despite being a public domain researcher i don't know how much of this legal Muppet ""Nightmare"" as a similar post talks about this better. And while Kermit/Sam and Friend's copyright status is still a disputed mess of green muck, that doesn't mean Jim Henson's other characters are this.

Now i recently got into a fight with NitwitTheKid (PLEASE do not attack him), who is a user here if you don't know. And honestly he claimed Flash Gordon was still copyrighted when i gave him EVIDENCE he wasn't and he blocked me when i tried debunking his claims. But then realized he did a similar thing last year from this post:  
[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjgp\_649MuNAxWxFlkFHZusKuwQFnoECCEQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fpublicdomain%2Fcomments%2F1evf9wz%2Fthere\_are\_still\_people\_claiming\_that\_jim\_hensons%2F&usg=AOvVaw3SX9LgsMWwa6hSNSWeOq8r&opi=89978449](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjgp_649MuNAxWxFlkFHZusKuwQFnoECCEQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fpublicdomain%2Fcomments%2F1evf9wz%2Fthere_are_still_people_claiming_that_jim_hensons%2F&usg=AOvVaw3SX9LgsMWwa6hSNSWeOq8r&opi=89978449)

  
Now in this post it's him basically criticizing a group of users last year just because they ""claimed"" they were public domain, while it is understandable why he made the post. And it got many upvotes mostly due to rapid Muppet posts from last year, but honestly. The post is honestly false and because of the Flash Gordon situation i'm starting to think Nitwitthekid knows NOTHING about how copyright works. Even going as far to ""contact the Jim Henson musuem"" which.. Really? Why contact them about the copyright statuses? Sometimes companies claim they own copyrights to media that aren't actually copyrighted. Also idk why he said that.

Now many of Jim Henson's works that are considered public domain are old 1950s-1980s? Commercials that lacked a notice, even some shows and specials. Although while the copyright for Sam and Friends is still up to debate, many of Henson's pre-recorded material can be found on Wikisource (Which is a reliable source of PD Works, the Captain America serial was only one fluke as i know as the renewal didn't surface until later..) But as for Henson's works, many of those are commericals for Esskay Meats and others which also introduced the characters of Mack and others.  


PDSH Wiki has a lot of them, and honestly while that wiki MAY have a bad rep sometimes (Although i personally think the wiki is overhated kinda.) As i looked into the commercials i can confirm there are in fact no notices on NEITHER of them. The Wiklins coffee first commercial had a notice, but i didn't seem to find a renewal for it as the commercial was made pre-1964.

Henson did renew and register copyrights for some of the puppet names, but it's often debated if they are the character designs (like with Kermit.) Cause past court rulings stated Characters had to be part of a larger work to be copyrighted.  as Wikipedia states ""The [Copyright Act of 1976](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Act_of_1976) does not explicitly mention fictional characters as subject matter of copyright, and their copyrightability is a product of common law. Historically, the Courts granted copyright protection to characters as parts of larger protected work and not as independent creations. They were regarded as ""components in copyrighted works"" and only protected insofar as their containing works were protected. Recognition of characters as independent works distinct to the plot in which they were embodied came about only in 1930 in the case of [*Nichols v. Universal Pictures*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nichols_v._Universal_Pictures_Corp.).[^(\[)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_protection_for_fictional_characters#cite_note-7)^("" "")

Now a character CAN be protected if it's distinct enough with traits, but honestly Kermit was a puppet and his sufficiently unique traits weren't made later until later works. AccomplishedHouse stated the renewal was possibly of Kermit the character as texile art but i don't really agree because there is no proof. 

Now back to the post, Nitwit doesn't give proof if the Henson works are still under copyright, yes Kermit's status is still a mystery as while there are rumors of the Jim Henson company still owning the rights to Sam and Friends, the show lacks any renewals but it's ""publication"" is still a mystery. Live Broadcasts weren't considered ""published."" But wherever a broadcast is considered published depends on what a lawyer says.

But as for the other no notice/non-renewed works by Henson, THEY are in the public domain. Many of these commercials i saw featuring these characters had no notices. There is a saying that Rowlf's commercial is not PD cause it's canadian in origin but i remember AccomplishedHouse also stating in a Sheena the Jungle Queen post that if a foregin work was made by a US Resident it doesn't qualify for URRA restoration which.. well that's a different story

Also i felt like Nitwitthekid only made it because he was tired of the muppet posts, honestly if he felt that he could have just ignored them. But making up misinformation claiming Henson's older characters are not public domain without giving proof on how they are still copyrighted is just generally stupid, same for Flash Gordon. Now this post is meant for constructive criticism on the actual post, not to harass anyone.

So guys to clear up the confusion, YES. Some of Henson's works are in fact in the public domain, and that Nitwit's post is basically false, lacking any citations and mostly him just falsely claiming something is under copyright. If you want a better copyright expert to talk to, I recommend talking to Jennifer Jenkins, Blister Kirby or anyone else who's a better person. But most agree that many of Henson's works have fell out of copyright due to renewal neglect and lack of notices.",1,1748634639.0,publicdomain,1,1.0,False

I really would like some advice, because I'm new to the dating scene in general, and I don't want too be too much too early. So, I meet this girl on a dating website, and we went on a date (picnic, lasted like 4 hours). Now for a while we have just been talking daily online, because we both have our last year at University and jobs, so it's been a bit hard to find mutual free time. Last week we did go get coffee when we both had time. 

So the problem is... I have a hard time telling when something is a ""date"" unless specifically said so. And I'm not sure if she sees it that way, or if it was just friendly coffee. We are both a bit akward, so it's hard to tell, and I in general sometimes don't read friendship/dating/other situations very well. 

Would it be weird too ask her how she sees it. Just to like... clarify, if we are hanging out as more like friends, or if she also sees it as going on dates? Or would it be too early?

A friend showed me this tool they built for themselves at work. We were catching up over coffee and they casually mentioned they’d stopped manually drafting sales proposals, contracts, and technical documents.

Naturally, I asked, “*Wait, what do you mean you stopped writing them?*”

They pulled up a screen and showed me what looked like a search bar sitting inside a document editor.

They typed:

>

And then just like that… a clean, well-formatted document appeared, complete with all the necessary details pulled from previous projects and templates. 

They had spent years doing this the old way. Manually editing contracts, digging through old docs, rewriting the same thing in slightly different formats every week.

Now?

* You can ask questions inside documents, like “What’s missing here?” 
* Search across old RFPs, contracts, and templates — even PDFs
* Auto-fill forms using context from previous conversations
* Edit documents by prompting the AI like you’re chatting with a teammate
* Turn any AI search result into a full professional document

It’s like **Cursor for documents**. having a smart assistant that understands your documents, legalities and builds new ones based on your real work history. 

The best part? It’s free. You can test it out for your next proposal, agreement, or internal doc and probably cut your writing time in half. (sharing the link in the comments)

In the present day, I am several months post partum. I refuse to be baba with no manners' victim. He thrived on how i always asked him to be present emotionally. The more I tried, the worse it got because he would now do things to hurt me intentionally. All I ever did was just try and find another way to be heard, seen and felt. What hurt the most was how he refused intimacy and women can tell you how hot it gets in the second trimester 😂😂. As i give this series, I have tried everything and even consulted his parents but nothing has worked. 

I only decided to go back to myself and let him be. I let him do what he wants when he wants because I needed to be sane. I remember in my early days into mothering, i always wished i just sleep and never wake up. I needed him to tell me I will be okay and it's a phase. My CS incision got infected and it had to be opened, two weeks post birth. It was left open (with a gauze, inaekwa betadine solution to help suck out the puss/mahira) and I went for cleaning everyday for three weeks. That was horrifying ongeza kushuka stairs na kupanda every single day. I did hurt so much but he just expected me to be okay telling me I shouldn't overthink. 

In the present day, I stopped needing him, I have stopped asking him about making an effort fir us. I know when I bounce back, I will be at a good place to have everything I desired (my future fast salary i will take my baby and I to dinner, we will dress up and go to the best place and have a nice meal then go back home). I haven't demanded for much, I just wanted to rely on my supposed partner but in this relationship it's a crime. 

Anyway, it's a Friday, he already left after coming from work around six pm, he will show up tomorrow 😂😂😂. My baby and I get to enjoy the extra space. I just took a cup of coffee, I have put baby to sleep, I want to do some reading then sleep, it's a perfect night, I am embracing my life and making peace that love is an illusion and I am okay.

*I never connect with people. I don’t even know what deep is.  Feelings get on my nerves and I don’t know why everyone has to talk about such things all the time.  Empathy isn't happening.*

She decided why not.  The last three marriages hadn’t ended well so might as well cut to the chase.

On the part where it asked what Ronnie was seeking in others, she decided to just tell the true.  Seemed simpler so she wrote:  

*I like someone just like me. We will discuss the world, clinically.  We can help each other with strategy.  We will sit over coffee discussing ideas to help each other.   The world will be our game of chess.  No other romance wanted or expected.*

If only the last three had known that going in.  Maybe there would have been less argues, maybe they’d still be together? She could dream couldn’t she?

But would see tell them about what special needs she might bring?

Should she really be so honest as to tell them that with one wrong move they are chop suey to her?  Should she tell them she got bored of the other 32 boyfriends and left?  That she forgot all their birthdays and anniversaries to the point she knew they already checked out anyway?

Would she really be happy with what she got if she told them the real truth. Would they respect her? Would things even go okay?  

It seemed so unknown.  Ronnie paused thinking of the time she told her husband that he had to have patience because she felt like running off to Texas to visit Waco with her new homeless bf in a van? Or about the incidents involving guns?

No, not that honest, Ronnie thought then let out a deep breath.  Some ghost gotta remain in the closet.  ‘You don’t wanna scare people,’ she said aloud to her self and hit the “send” button.

Kitty appeared uninjured but was panting  with heat & stress. I walked up and knelt and it ran away (luckily sticking to the edge of the concrete sound wall).

It was staring at the oncoming traffic, so I could walk up a few steps, then freeze when it looked back. The traffic noise covered my noises. 

I got about a foot behind, then GRABBED and GOT just as my wife pulled up with the folding emergency carrier that of course we have in all our vehicles. 

I’m at a coffee shop while she continues errands. Little Frieze is terrified, overheated, and hissing. 

So we gave them a saucer of tepid water with a pinch of salt and sugar, and some privacy.

1kzd956,https://www.reddit.com/r/Iloilo/comments/1kzd956/iloiloguimaras/,Iloilo-Guimaras,"This is my personal experience and I just want to share it with everyone since there’s no Guimaras subreddit—and this story also includes some Iloilo experiences.

Last Saturday, May 24, I went to Guimaras for the Manggahan Festival with my family and my girlfriend. I’m 26, female, and I have an aunt in Guimaras. It’s not my first time visiting the island—I’ve been there around 4 to 5 times already—but I hadn’t explored its tourist spots before except for Alubijod.

We commuted from Bacolod to Iloilo, then to Guimaras. It’s been a while since I last went through Bredco, and wow, everything there revolves around money—from the Grab entrance fee to the terminal fee. Anyway, we just passed through Iloilo briefly. I haven’t really explored the city yet; maybe I’ve only spent a few hours there before. I’ve been to Roberto’s, SM, and Creamhorn—and the same thing happened this time.

When we got to Parola Port, it was really crowded. Understandable, since it’s Manggahan Festival and there was a heavy volume of passengers. But what’s sad is that the lines in Iloilo City weren’t organized, especially considering the needs of seniors and PWDs.

Fast forward—we finally got on the boat to Guimaras. It had a setup like a jeepney, and I was amazed at how much safer these boats are now compared to before. But it was frustrating that I had to repeat over and over that we had 2 seniors and 1 student with us before the conductor deducted the proper fare. The regular fare was ₱30, but they only deducted ₱3 for discounted passengers.

The trip was safe, and when we arrived in Guimaras, we stopped by my mom’s sister’s place. She used to live in Iloilo but now stays in Guimaras. Near her house, there was a 7/11—and I was amazed they had chicken there, unlike in Bacolod (at least I haven’t seen one here, though I saw one coming soon near La Salle).

I was really excited for this trip because it was my girlfriend’s first time visiting Guimaras. We planned a day tour around the island with my cousin. A few days before the trip, I was shocked at how expensive rentals were. Compared to Siquijor (which is already quite popular), Guimaras was more expensive. I thought it was maybe because of Manggahan, but nope—those are the regular rates. Motorbike rentals ranged from ₱500–₱800 per day. Back in 2024 when we went to Siquijor, rentals were only ₱350–₱400. Can someone explain this price gap?

We spent ₱1,500 for a 6–7 hour day tour. We explored 5 tourist spots, excluding places we’d already been to like the provincial capitol and Jordan Wharf. Here’s my quick review:

•	Wind Farm – 10/10
•	Guisi Lighthouse – 6/10
•	Trappist Monastery & Pasalubong Center – 10/10 (loved their dried mangoes!)
•	Alubijod Cove – 7/10 (very different now, the public CR was awful)
•	The Pitstop – -1/10: totally overrated. Mango pizza was good (for me and my cousin), but the spaghetti and chicken were as cold as our iced tea. The place was packed and the staff were impatient. The waiter didn’t even finish cleaning our table before leaving. Same thing happened to the next group who came in. They also said the chicken was salty and the food was cold. They could’ve at least microwaved the food.

Honestly, I didn’t feel the hospitality from the people in Guimaras. Most were snobbish, and it felt like some locals weren’t happy about tourists. I’ve been to many provinces, but this one felt different. Our tour guide was kind and patient, but the people in booths and even some tricycle drivers were not welcoming and were overcharging for short trips.

Overall, the experience was just meh. If it were Siquijor or Dumaguete, I’d go back—but probably not to Guimaras after this.

Come Monday, we faced a dilemma: rent a car and visit Garin Farm, or just commute a bit around the city then head back to Bacolod. We chose the latter after Ilonggos gave Garin Farm bad reviews. We dropped by Coffee Break—and contrary to what Yobab said, I disagree. The food and drinks were super sweet, not bland at all. That’s all. I’d rather visit another island—definitely not Guimaras again. Sorry.",5,1748633636.0,Iloilo,4,1.0,False

I just moved into a new studio apartment and I’m super excited, but also a little stumped when it comes to furnishing the place because of its unusual shape. I’d really appreciate some advice or layout ideas!

- A bed (of course)
- A sofa
- A coffee table
- A TV with maybe a tv stand
- And I have a gaming setup that I plan to place on the wall to the left of the fridge. That spot is diagonal from the kitchen, so my back would be facing the kitchen while I’m gaming.

 I thought about suicide for a few mins after not having done in a while so becuase 2 months of meds made my anxiety decrease to a point where I atleats don’t go on a suicide mission every time smgt even slightly ticks me off and has me experience ‘panic’. Why? Becuase I been procrastinating for a few weeks on smgt and fuck the SELF HATE and voices of incapability set in a few days ago.   
Today was weird. Because I slept a proper number of hours in a while BUT I woke up feeling like I was on drugs. Yes I consumed coffe todya but like I consume coffee everyday and I don’t feel like this? Did the better sleep make the coffee work better or smgt? ALSO THE LIGHTS WERE SO BRIGHT TO ME FOR LIKE HALF THE DAY TODAY AND LIKE WTF EVEN. LIKE IT WASNT BRIGHT IN A GOOD WAY, IT HONESTLY MADE THINGS SLIGHTLY MORE BLURRY. LIKE WHAT? And btw, I was really excited todya to outdo everything I ever thought was possible nb work like a madman. But like….idk it’s like there was this weird big fog in my brain. But idk it didn’t feel like the depression fog I had. Like everything took so much fucking effort and like a ball of fog was slowing down my cognitive abilities and smgt that should be SO EASY is taking me 8 times the effort with no output even because I kept getting excited about this thing and that. And even when I’d di lock my device away, it didn’t help. Yesterday, this wasn’t there. Like I was able to study a little yesterday and even though I was using my device a lot, I didn’t have the fog and could focus perfectly when I actually got over wtv was holding me back then and started to do my work. But todya, what even.

Oh btw, I just saw the executive dysfunction post. But I mean, if that’s what that it is, then it happens all the goddamn time. Yesterday was the firts time in weeks I studied. But like.

Alright, here I am, giving this another shot. I posted something similar before, but figured it wouldn’t hurt to try again—maybe I’ll catch the right person this time!

For those who missed the first post: I’m a guy from Germany, and I work as a psychologist. And just to clear this up right away—I’m not secretly analyzing you (unless that’s your thing). I’ve learned to be really good at reading people, but it’s a skill I developed over time, not some innate ability. Honestly, having to put in more effort than most to understand social cues has made me pay closer attention to details, and it’s helped me see things from perspectives that others might miss. So, while I don’t read minds, I’ve gotten pretty good at reading situations, and people seem to appreciate that when they open up to me.

That being said, I do have a tendency to be a bit direct or precise in conversations. I like clarity, and I prefer when dialogue isn’t too vague. I find that cutting through the fluff and getting to the point makes things feel more genuine and efficient. Sometimes that can come off as a little too cold or blunt—especially in professional settings—but it’s not intentional. When I’m one-on-one with someone, though, I’m all about being present and engaged. That’s when I can really open up and connect.

I’m not someone who thrives in big social circles or constantly needs to be out and about. If you’re into clubbing or always surrounded by a crowd, we probably won’t click. But if you’re someone who values deep conversations over coffee, or even just enjoys sitting in comfortable silence together, that’s more my pace.

I can talk about a wide range of topics—so long as the other person is genuinely into it. Passion is contagious, and if you have something you love enough to talk about for hours, I’ll be all ears. I’ve got my own things I can ramble on about, but I’ll spare you the monologue for now.

A little more about me: I go to the gym regularly—not because I’m chasing a six-pack or anything, but because I believe in taking care of my body. If you’re into fitness too, that’s a plus, but it’s not a must.

So what am I looking for? I’m after a long-term connection with someone who’s in or near Germany, ideally not older than me, and preferably not taller than 5’5” (yes, I have a height preference—don’t judge me!). But more importantly, I’m looking for someone I can truly vibe with. Someone who enjoys their own space but also knows how to build a deeper connection. Someone who doesn’t need constant social interaction to feel fulfilled, but knows how to value quality time with the right person.

If you’re still reading, tell me two truths and a lie. Let’s see how good I really am at reading people! 😄",1,1748633297.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

A writer is ALWAYS in this state, where he is completely invulnerable to all damages inside the story. However, they can interact with their charachters by enering the second state.

The second state is: Inside the story. Basically the writers write themselves as characters in their story. This way, they can interact with their charachters directly and other writers who write themselves. Inside the story, they posses many names and forms. For example, Tato, is my human form inside the story, and T is my drone form inside the story. Other people like Z, decided to make their writer different entty, as a pale, tall looking thing. So basically inside the story they can always change forms and names as their real life personification wants. 

The first state is permanent. A writer can be in the second state at the same time as the first one but never the second alone. This is because if there is no human in the first state, there is no one who can write the story.

While in the first state, as I already mentioned, The writers have a wider selection of abilities to warp realities. In the second state, they have a smaller selection. Z's writer for example, presents another two states while in story. THe second one hasn't been shown yet but while in the first one, they can shoot posters in their walls. This makes it so that he can edit his word with just a gun, paper, and ink. However, if Z's writer decided to interact with their charachters, they would enter the second, yet to be shown, state.  Tato has already shown interaction in this state, where to warp reality, he needs to burn a paper, and reality will warp as the paper said. They can write ""coffee"" on their paper snd so it will happen. A cup of coffee would appear. 

Writers also possess the ability to decide what can and what can's happen. This, I've named ""narrative barriers"". If the writer wants his story to go one way specfically, hey cna install a narrative barrier. If they don't want another charachter to revive theirs, they can forbid it.

One example of this situation could be if Isaac (The cult's most poewrful magician) tried to use true resurection to revive a character of mine, but I didn't want my character to live in that moment because I have plans, I could install a narrative barrier and stop this. Writers can install narrative barriers to protect their charachters from other writers or other charachter's writers and usually there is no way to stop this.d

Vulnerabilities:

Everyone has their weakness. Frankenstein: Fire. Dracula: the cross. H: Electricity in high voltages. And unfortunately, writers have a wider range of weaknesses. 

If the writer, in any state, was to be killed. Their charachters would go with him. No matter the situation. If they are killed in the story, it doesn't matter that they can write themselves into the story again, Characters would still be dead permanently. If killed outside the story, well that's logical, they are dead and thus, no one can write the story. Characters would still die. That is the main vulnerability of a writer.

Another really dangerous vulnerability is the writers own subconcious. T presented a situation like this. You see I have three layers of wrtier narrative where my irl human form is also some sort of character. This irl form, had some problem. As some of you may be aware, H came originally from a different dimension... and my IRL form always wondered ""What happened to the original dimension hax?"" and so, my story was that the thought inplanted in my mind, and my subconcious basically forced me to write an evil version of that H. That H was driven by the thought of me abandoning him. ""You decided to abandon me, you gave that happy ending to a cheap copy..."" This subconsious forms can interact with both the IRL version of the writer, and the in story version of the writer. They also possess abilities powerful enough to defeat narrative barriers, since they live in the writer's mind. For example, Hax (H's evil subconcious version) achieved near perfect vulnerabilty against me and all my characters. I say near perfect because two stuff can happen. 

R simply unlocked a potential where he almost killed hax and the other thing... well that is more complicated. Other writers characters can defeat Hax if they want to. This is because the writers can install narrative barriers to protect their characters from Hax. And this barriers, evil subconcious entities, can't shatter them. This way, hax can be defeated. 

However, Hax also can install his own narrative barriers because he lives in the writer's mind and has most of the abilities of the writer. 

Only other writers or charachters can defeat this evil versions if they can catch hax off guard.

One last thing can happen. A writer CAN NOT under ANY circumstance, Reveal they are the controllers of their charachter's to the charachters. This can cause existential crisis. The illusion of free will, completely gone for them. And the worst part, is they DO have some sort of free will but they could still enter break down. T once tried presenting himself to H and he had to delete H's memories about the event because he almost broke down. This is why wirters can interact with their charachters but they can know he is a writer. 

Only exception to this is for example, Isaac. As mentioned before, he is a really grat magician who elaborated a spell called ""The glimpse beyond"". His writer decided that he could see him and Isaac, with his great understanding of the universe he is living in, did not confuse in that moment due to how the spell worked. He is aware of his life and did not enter a break down. And it's better to keep it that way.

That's basically all info that you guys need to know to include your writers into the story. If you think I forgot a detail, just tell me and I'll check if i should include it or not. And that's all. see you around guys.

I have this longing for years to go home, to belong somewhere. A home for me is where my peace is. 

At 35, I’m sitting in my house 
with a cup of coffee in my hand, 
and yet, I still want to go home.
I just want to go home.

I don’t know where my home is.
Because within me, 
it definitely isn’t there.
I’ve spent years wondering 
if I’ll ever make peace within myself. 

Growing up as a lonely only child with not so present  parents, over the time I developed avoidant
attachments.  
It sucks to realize that for years, I wanted to be loved but I was the one pushing people away.  

I never had a good relationship with my parents, they were too controlling. 
After years of emotional abuse, I learned to maintain strict boundaries. 
 It gave me space and time to heal from them.

Then, with my wife, things started to fall apart. After five years of marriage, she began to become controlling too.
 It triggered my avoidant self all over again. We had ego clashes , conflicts and what not.

After the divorce, everything felt so heavy. It felt like everything is just against me , I never got that peace at home . 
Over the time I became that stereotypical divorced, workaholic manager everyone resents.  
Work and study were always my ways of coping. I took therapy eventually, and after a year into it I started to express my emotions and started taking accountability of my decisions

I don't know how on earth I got this fortunate to find love again after a messy divorce, I started dating again and the only peace I have now is my girlfriend. I rest my head on her lap, she caresses my hair while I crib about  everything. 
And suddenly things starts to make sense and feels good again .

But I don’t want to depend on her for peace.
 I don’t want to hand someone else the responsibility of being my home.
 I want to be that for myself.

At 35. Sitting in my house. Coffee in hand.
 Everything looks fine from the outside.
But inside… I still whisper to myself, 
“Mujhe ghar jana hai.”

Maybe one day I’ll build that home inside me.
A place that doesn’t disappear when people leave.
 A place that doesn’t crumble under silence. May be one day I will find my home , my peace within me. ",17,1748632919.0,ThirtiesIndia,7,1.0,False

In my mid30s after having been the same weight since a teen I got a bad virus and was sick for a couple weeks, couldn't keep anything down but somehow gained almost 20lb and had a host of other symptoms that ended up being thyroid related. Ever since I've been trying everything unsuccessfully to lose weight. I was at the point where I was only eating 700 calories a day and not losing weight but somehow still gaining inches and losing muscle and energy and then I went through early menopause and put on more weight. When I first heard about the glp-1 drugs I was excited but then disappointed that they just worked by decreasing calorie intake. More recently though I was hearing they actually do more, especially wrt zepbound, changing how the metabolism works since people were losing even more weight than could be explained by calories alone so I talked to my doctor and he definitely agreed there's more to the picture than CICO and tirzepatide might help me.  

But, since I took my first shot I'm not experience hunger at all. I usually just eat when I'm really hungry, I don't experience food noise, and I enjoy really simple foods like salads, veggie soups and beans and rice with steamed veggies, but now I have no desire to eat anything except maybe sugar. My first week I had two pieces of toast, a bowl of rice with steamed veggies, a burrito, a blended ice coffee drink and a lollipop for the whole week. Starting my second week now so far I had a bite of a chocolate chip muffin and could eat no more. I'm up about 2lb from when I started and the middle of the week last week I was even higher than that. I don't understand how this is possible! 

I'm hoping it's just going to take a bit for things to kick in? I worry though about my heart especially with how little I eat and how much weight I'm carrying in my middle.

Let’s be honest: if you had told me five years ago that I’d one day be passionately evaluating THC gummies like a sommelier does fine wine, I would’ve laughed mid-coffee sip and told you to get real. But here we are. The world has changed, and so has the way we unwind, get creative, ease pain, and catch some truly restorative sleep.

Delta-9 THC gummies have carved out a space in the wellness and recreational markets that’s somewhere between a vibe and a revolution. And if you’re on the hunt for the *best* D9 gummies out there—whether for chill weekends, inspired mornings, or the kind of sleep that makes you drool on your pillow—I’ve got your back. I’ve tested, tasted, spaced out, giggled, and *slept like a rock* for the sake of journalistic integrity. (You’re welcome.)

So let’s dive into the best [Delta-9 gummies](https://simpleleaf.com/collections/delta-9-gummies/) of 2025. Spoiler alert: Simple Leaf steals the show.

# 🥇 Best Overall: Simple Leaf Delta-9 Gummies

**Top Picks:** Strawberry Lemonade | Caramel Apple | Blueberry Dreamzzz

Let me say this plainly: there is *no* other gummy on the market like a [Simple Leaf ](https://simpleleaf.com/)gummy. I don’t mean that metaphorically. I mean it in the most literal, chewy, euphoric sense.

Simple Leaf is a brand that takes quality so seriously, they might as well wear lab coats while crafting these things. Their Delta-9 gummies are vegan, gluten-free, non-GMO, and made with real fruit and natural sweeteners. You won’t find any weird artificial dyes or tongue-coating syrups here—just clean, reliable effects and phenomenal flavor.

**Strawberry Lemonade** is my daytime go-to. It’s like sunshine in a square—bright, sweet, and just tart enough to wake up your creativity. I pop one before going for a hike or when I want to feel focused and elevated without the couch lock.

Then there’s **Caramel Apple**—hellooo fall nostalgia. Imagine a warm October breeze, a hayride, and biting into a caramel-dipped apple... but with a gentle 10mg THC buzz. It's cozy and euphoric without being overwhelming.

But if you struggle with sleep, *please* do yourself a favor and try **Blueberry Dreamzzz**. Formulated with Delta-9, CBD, CBN, L-theanine, passion flower, and indica terpenes, this gummy is basically a lullaby in edible form. I swear I’ve had dreams so good on these that I woke up wanting to go back to sleep just to finish them.

And can we talk about consistency? Every jar I’ve tried—without fail—has delivered on taste, texture, and effect. Zero guesswork. Zero letdowns.

# 🥈 Runner-Up: Kiva Camino Sours

**Top Picks:** Orchard Peach | Watermelon Spritz

California-based Kiva is another powerhouse in the THC edible game. Their Camino line has a cult following, and for good reason. The *Sours* are juicy, tangy, and come with fast-acting effects. I love their **Orchard Peach** gummy when I’m socializing—it keeps me chatty, warm, and engaged.

That said, the flavors tend to lean on the artificial side, and the texture is a bit firmer than I prefer. Still, great for those looking for a quick onset and reliable high.

# 🥉 Best Microdose Option: Mr. Moxey’s THC Mints

**Top Picks:** Balance Peppermint (5mg THC)

Okay, not technically a gummy, but worth mentioning. [Mr. Moxey’s](https://www.mrmoxeys.com/) makes these charming THC mints that are ideal for new users or those looking for light, mood-lifting experiences. They’re discreet, portable, and perfect for microdosing throughout the day without overwhelming your system.

Think of it as the functional THC option for meetings, grocery shopping, or cleaning your closet while listening to [Fleetwood Mac](https://open.spotify.com/artist/08GQAI4eElDnROBrJRGE0X).

# The Delta-9 Difference

For those new to the world of Delta-9 THC, here’s the quick version: it’s the same psychoactive compound that’s been famous since your cousin’s garage band days in the ‘90s—but now it’s legal (at least in hemp-derived, [<0.3% by dry weight](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/is-cbd-legal-heres-what-you-need-to-know-according-to-science) formats in many states). When done right, [D9 gummies](https://simpleleaf.com/collections/delta-9-gummies/) deliver a reliable, feel-good buzz that’s cleaner and more manageable than smoking or vaping.

That’s what makes Simple Leaf stand out. They don’t just “do” Delta-9—they *perfect* it.

# 📝 Final Thoughts

I’ve tried dozens of THC gummies from big names, small indie brands, and everything in between. Some were great. Some tasted like a tire dipped in sugar. And a few left me questioning my life choices.

But Simple Leaf? That’s a brand I come back to over and over. Whether I need focus, joy, or some deep, glorious sleep, their gummies have become an essential part of my wellness routine.

They taste good, feel good, and do good (shoutout to their clean ingredients and eco-friendly vibes). If you’re looking to elevate your edible game, start with Simple Leaf. You’ll never look at another gummy the same way again.

Ever had that *soul-crushing* afternoon slump that makes you want to crawl under your desk and nap till tomorrow? Yep, same here. 😅 The clock strikes 2 PM and suddenly it feels like I’ve got a brain full of molasses. But fear not, there’s hope – and it doesn’t involve a caffeine IV drip!

I went down the rabbit hole of breathing techniques (seriously, who knew there were so many right ways to breathe?), and spent a week experimenting on myself. Here’s my journey through five different techniques and which one was the *real MVP*. Ready? Let’s dive in!

**1. Box Breathing:**  
*Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4.* Navy SEALs swear by it. Did I feel badass? Totally. Did it wake me up? Ehh, not so much. 🙃 Maybe I’m just not SEAL material.

**2. 4-7-8 Breathing:**  
This one brought me the *calm*, but energy? Not quite. It felt more pre-nap than post-nap. Still, A+ for calming my *jittery brain*.

**3. Alternate Nostril Breathing:**  
Yep, you read that right. Sounds weird, but you use your fingers to block one nostril at a time. Definitely had a zen yoga vibe going, but trying this in public… let’s just say it didn’t win me the “Subtle Employee of the Year” award.

**4. Three-Part Breath:**  
*Inhale into your belly, ribs, then chest. Exhale that way too.* This one felt like a workout for my lungs. Not exactly the energy boost I needed, but hey, maybe I’ll have abs of steel if I keep at it? 😂

**5. **Drumroll, please**… The Energizer:**  
*Quick inhales through the nose, quick puffs out through the mouth, like blowing out candles.* Guys, THIS was the game-changer! Suddenly, I was back to my focus-driven self, minus the post-coffee jitters. 🚀

So, if you find yourself fading when the sun hits its afternoon peak, give that Energizer technique a whirl. It's like a mini internal recharge session! 🔌✨

Anyone else tried these or got a personal favorite? I love hearing what works for you, especially if it makes us all feel like we could conquer the world by 3 PM. 😎

Keep breathing, keep maximizing! ❤️

1. I hear that if you eat 'bad' food, you'll regret it (side effects) - is this a trial and error type approach or generally just eat protein, fruit, and veg and some carbs?
2. Coffee. Can I keep it? 😅 
3. I am training for a 10k. I'm pretty unhealthily, so it's slow going, I assume as long as I'm fueling my body right, then workouts are fine?
4. I read about hair loss - I have curly hair, and I quite like it. Any vitamins I should use?
5. Last one, do I need to calorie count?

1kzcnwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1kzcnwi/always_the_victim/,Always the victim,"Just so annoyed with JNMIL. She always has to be the victim anytime a boundary is set. 

When LO was not even two months old, JNMIL and FIL watched LO for an evening while I attended as event. I told JNMIL specifically no blankets for LO and they had a bouncer style fisher price chair that I told them she could be in if she was awake but not to let her sleep in it. JNMIL said she wouldn’t let her sleep in it and agreed to no blankets. When I arrived to pick LO up she was asleep in that chair with a blanket on her and both of them had temporarily left that room to greet me. The next day was my baby shower and JNMIL was bragging about how they got her to sleep in that chair. 

After that JNMIL played the victim after kissing my daughter even though we had set a no kissing rule and she was well aware of the reasoning by saying she “was too afraid to hold my daughter because she was scared she might kiss her” okay then… 

DH and I had a conversation with them and it’s taken months of work for us to feel like we are comfortable to give another opportunity to babysit. We actually ended up going to couples counselling to get on the same page on how to deal with his mothers manipulation, undermining of our parenting decisions, etc. 

Well, I have an appointment next week two minutes from home. We decided now that LO will be 9 months old that we could give JNMIL another chance at babysitting. My stipulations are it’s in our home (where I can check the baby monitor on my phone to ensure safe sleep instructions are followed), and that as we learnt in counselling, safe sleep instructions are explicitly told to JNMIL as a non-negotiable rule to be followed. 

So after drafting a text message that DH was okay with I texted MIL this:

“Hi JNMIL. I have an appointment on Tuesday morning at 9:30. I am wondering if you would be able to watch LO that morning for a couple hours? 

She will need a nap somewhere around 9:30 or 10- depending what time she wakes up. Since it’ll be over nap time I would prefer if you came here to watch her so she is in her familiar environment and space. 

If you want, feel free to come over a bit earlier for a coffee before I head out. 

Because it will be over nap time, I just want to be clear that we will need all safe sleep instructions followed exactly. That means LO goes down in her crib, in her sleep sack with no blankets or other items in the crib. We did sleep train her so she’ll fall asleep on her own even if she fusses or cries a bit. 

We appreciate your help and feel ready to give this another try. We’re just firm on safe sleep, it is non-negotiable for us and we want to avoid a repeat of what happened the night of *previous event of the sleep incident*

Let me know if that works for you. Thanks again.”

She agreed to babysit and said she would come early to go over the safe sleep instructions. 

DH gets home last night and said FIL called him yesterday. He said him and JNMIL were “not impressed” with my text yesterday. DH told them he had approved of it and essentially that he stands behind what I said as our daughter’s safety is top priority. He told me he wanted to call JNMIL today to tell her it wasn’t meant offensively but that we want to be clear on our expectations. 

Well what came out of that call but JNMIL being the victim and being “nervous to screw up or mistakes to happen” and feeling disrespected that the past of what happened the last time she watched her was brought up. 

So again the conversation is flipped from LOs safety to JNMILs feelings. I’m so done with the triangulation of my husband and the emotional manipulation for setting boundaries to keep my child safe. I’m so tempted just to cancel on her babysitting and ask someone else in my circle since she seems to care more about her feelings than accountability of her mistakes and my child’s safety.

i had a 8 top order only house faves with only waters today. i couldn’t upsell them a single coffee even. i ran to that table maybe a total of 20 times refilling their waters and running plates and they still gave me a $4 tip. $4 for 8 waters + refills, 8+ plates bc things get plated separately when they ask. they gave me $4. 

these people come in with a cheap mindset because they already want a $6 meal, and proceed to forget tipping is a thing. and decide they cannot afford to do it that day.

1kzcimz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1kzcimz/suspected_quiet_bpd_want_opinions/,Suspected Quiet BPD Want Opinions,"So a little over 2.5 years ago I match on a dating app with a beautiful woman. We seem to have a lot of the same interests (and interests that people from our area don't typically- have ie sports and exotic travel). We end up going out twice, but she ends it saying she didn't feel a connection. During the two weeks of us talking, we would text for hours a day. I accepted it. She even commented later on how she couldn't believe how kind I was when she said she didn't want to see me again.

Over the course of the next year, we would occasionally exchange messages. About a year and a half ago she came over for dinner (at her moms suggestion). We started dating and after a few dates she seemed unsure. We went out again and from there it was on. A few dates in she was uneasy if she wanted to continue going out, but we went out again. From then on smooth sailing and we were madly in love.

We dated for approx. a year and I proposed. Travelled the world together. Anything she wanted we did or bought. We would spend all of our free time together. She was my best friend. We would talk for hours upon hours a day about everything. Our goals and values seem to match up. Her family loved me. I come from a mixed religious background and I even returned to her faith and got an annulment from the Catholic Church for my first marriage so we could marry.

After we got engaged, it seemed like she pulled back a bit. She became hypercritical of me. Started saying all of the things that she didn't like about me. She even made a list for my therapist (which I asked her to). These were all things that could be worked on and to me weren't deal breakers according to my therapist. Normal adult stuff. I also suffer from OCD and am working on that as sometimes it can be annoying. During this period she would go through periods of seeming being critical and worried to then assuring me it was her walls coming down and I was her forever person. There were a few instances where I did not pay enough attention to her when we were out and she became very upset. (to me this was just normal stuff, nothing major). I was paying attention but maybe I wasn't doting enough? She said I walked ahead of her (we were in a hurry) and one time at the mall she exploded on me because I wasn't paying attention to her while we were walking. It caught me very off guard because I literally couldn't figure out what I did wrong in the situation. We had a wedding date and everything, were supposed to go on a vacation in a week and one day she pulled away. Over the course of a few days she hated me. She said she did not want to be engaged. My therapist commented even at our last meeting that she seemed positive, yet after the session she got on the phone with her mom who reinforced we aren't compatible-which was odd because the mom adored me.

When I met up with her the last time, she stated that I had bullied her into this relationship, treated her like a second class citizen, that I was a narcissist, and stated that I could not love her how she needed. She then went on to say she never really wanted this and that we were two people who were just excited to have someone. It blew my mind. Additionally she stated that I lied to her about things to get her to like me. She said she never wanted to see or talk to me again. We talked for several hours and she cut it off saying as she didn't want to keep talking as she might regret her decision to break it off. She made us pull out our phones and unfollow each other on instagram at the same time (seemed childish to me).  It was like she went from a person who loved me more than anything to hating me over night for no real reason. She said a few days ago she drove to get coffee and paid-and women in her family don't drive or pay for things. Mind you I paid for 99% of everything in the relationship. During our relationship I never raised my voice or anything-yet she made me meet her in a parking lot because she did not feel comfortable with us being at one of our homes. It was the weirdest thing of my life. We've been NC for over 4 months now.

A few things that standout from the relationship that I noticed:

1. Weird relationship before me. Prior to us dating, she indicated that she was in a 6 year relationship with her Dads friend. He lived far away by their vacation home, but he was 42 when they started dating and she was 21. They hid this relationship from everyone. What was odd was that she said that if they they spent more than 2 weeks together, it would of never lasted. She hated how he walked, chewed and talked. I found that extremely odd. Furthermore as time went on, she told me that they broke up 100 times in that period. I noticed it because she would say that she went out with this guy or that guy and it was during their period of dating. Additionally, she would block or unblock him and wanted him to view her stories and posts. She told me she wanted him to see just how good she was doing. (We often traveled to exotic destinations and flew private private once which she showed off). She also said he was a narcissist and told a story of verbal abuse from him. During the relationship and the break ups she would often do trips and go have fun-which they always broke up for. She repeatedly played the victim of this relationship-yet I found out that she was actually the one who went after him at the beginning. He would message her occasionally with some sappy instagram thing and it seemed to raddle her cage a lot.   After she dumped me, she told me she was going to date older again mind you I am 6 years older.
2. Took everything personally. As stated above, everything was an attack or slight against her if she didn't believe it. Rather than inquiring and discussing, it was just seen as an obvious incompatibility-even though we were compatible on 95% of things.
3. Could not forgive. She would bring things up from months ago. Things that I already apologized for. She even said once she never forgets anything and has a hard time forgiving. Almost everything that happened would be something a typical partner would forgive and forget in 5 minutes. When we met up last she told me everything I did wrong in the relationship, things that for any other person would have been water under the bridge.
4. She said I stopped trying after we were engaged. She told me that I used to bring her flowers and wine every time I saw her and that stopped. I still do a lot of things for her, yet those were all taken for granted. She wanted to feel butterflies every time she saw me. I thought we were moving into the true love phase and saw this as a natural progression-she saw this as I stopped loving her. I had a few things happen at work and was extremely stressed for the last month of our relationship. When we were breaking up I told her again about the hard time I was going through and she just said ""That's unfair to me"". She said she wanted someone who would wake up and text her how excited they were to marry her (i did text her every morning and talked for hours a day at night and during the day if possible). It was like nothing was enough at this point. I was still buying gifts and sending flowers on the regular. Her engagement ring I spent a fortune on and always showered her with the best of everything...jewelry, cute little gifts, dinners, trips and most of all my time and love. I always tried to be so understanding and would talk about any subject or issue with her no problem. I am not reactive at all and always sought to understand how I could be a better partner to her.
5. Social Media. She seemed to idolize certain influencers. One was her favorite. I told her that I was going to get a video of that person saying happy birthday to her and she flipped. She said she might meet her in real life and become friends and that would absolutely ruin it. Her goal was to become at one time an Instagram influencer. Additionally, when we were breaking up, she said that all the couples look so happy on social media and we didn't have that. She said that's what she always wanted. To me that was just unrealistic. She would even comment at the end while we were out at other happy couples and say look how happy they are. She was very into taking pictures and making very artistic posts. She also liked posting the occasional thirst trap. She told me she did this because she was just trying to find a husband.
6. Other men. She would get messages from guys in the past. It was always kind of odd. One days she even said well most likely if its a guy friend something happened with them (hooking up) in the past. It always was odd to me that she wanted attention from all these guys. We would be on trips and guys would slide into her DMs. She was hyper vigilant to know what women I had a past with and would not want to be around them. I don't keep in contact with women from my past as I thought it was inappropriate since I was in a serious relationship.
7. Criticism. She found at the end everything wrong with me and let me know. Even our engagement-I put a ton of energy into. The night was perfect and was everything she told me she wanted. Afterwards, she just focused on one small aspect of it she didn't like and that became what she would constantly bring up. It really took the wind out of my sails. I started to feel like nothing was good enough. The trips the gifts the hours of talking met nothing-all attention had to be on her always. This is when she started saying you can't love me how I need to be loved.
8. Inflexibility of opinion. She once said that she thought her partner would just be the boy version of her. Any differing opinion on religion or topics she took as incompatibility. Rather than discussing things-she would just say that that's the way she was raised and her family viewed things. Another example was she didn't attend college-she didn't believe that women needed an education if they didn't want it. I said it was probably a good idea if the kid went to college and then they could do whatever they want (I have several advanced degrees). She took this as a personal attack on her.
9. Religion. She had a very childlike view of religion. She was obsessed with signs from God etc. In one of our last communications she said basically God told her I am not the one. I literally got an annulment so we could get married and it wasn't good enough.
10. Family. She was very close with her family. The men in their family really catered to the women. She constantly told me that her needs should be put first and that if someone had to suffer, I had to because I was the man. I would always say a relationship we both need to put each other first. Her mother began telling her I am too independent (I enjoy the gym and a certain sport several times a week that didnt interfere with our time). That was literally all I did outside of our relationship. Her mom stated that she was looking for someone to do everything with in life-and I couldn't provide that. She seemed to constantly side with the mom and be worried if the mom perceived something I did as not aligning with the family. IE don't talk about this, don't do this, we have to do X because my family does. She would talk on the phone with her mom for a few hours a day-even telling me it was hard to have a relationship and talk with her as it took up so much time. The family loved me though-up until the end where she said they did not like me anymore. Towards the end I had her meet with my therapist once to try and improve on the things she wanted me to-and that was perceived by the family as this not being from god because a relationship should be easy. It literally was me just trying to improve to make her happy. She even said I was doing a lot better with the things she was worried about.
11. She would constantly say she felt unlovable and that she was waiting for the other shoe to drop in the relationship. She would say she was unlovable and make almost like a weird crying face and I would comfort her and tell her she was good enough. She had a high school boyfriend who became mean to her. She wanted to marry him but she eventually dumped him. She would bring that up as a traumatic event which I always tried to be aware of and let her know that would not happen as I was committed. One thing the boyfriend said to her is that he ""felt like he was being put in a box with all the criticism"". I felt the same way at the end and voiced this to her so we could work on it.
12. Going out. She told me we were incompatible because she always wanted to be on dates and going out. We did all this stuff, but she wanted more. She always wanted to be at the newest bar or restaurant. I love going out occasionally but can also be a homebody. She saw this as an extreme incompatibility even though we went out all the time. She asked me once if I like going to the City, I told her its not my favorite but I like going with her because I know how much she enjoys it.
13. Negative. We could have the most amazing night. One little thing could go wrong ie I was 5 minutes late or maybe after dinner we went home instead of getting a drink where she wanted. She took this as a personal attack on her and couldn't see what an awesome amazing weekend we had-even thought t the time she would admit it was a great time-a few days after she would focus on that one negative thing. She was hyper punctual and couldn't stand any deviation from a plan made. I though am super easy going. Anything she did I would always look at the positive.
14. My faults. It seems like she couldn't accept my faults. One time my OCD caused me to put a damper on an evening because I was worried about a potential issue at my home. She wanted to do something that evening. I was a little late to it (I am talking 5 minutes)-and it was the end of the world. I was committed to working on this. Additionally, she said I needed to go on medication for my ADHD. I finally agreed I would do it but it was too late. I am a super super easy going guy and was willing to work on anything for her.
15. Her parents would fight occasionally and her dad would withdraw from her mom. She was obsessed with love being withheld and it was a huge fear. I would constantly reassure her, but anytime I needed a moment or wasn't gloating over her she seemed to think I was purposely withholding love.
16. Photos. She looked through our photos and could tell me exactly ones that we were connected and ones we weren't. It was odd to me that she could literally remember every moment from when a photo was taken. I believe a relationship has to go through rupture and repair. It was like she couldn't accept that sometimes things aren't perfect but that I always love her even if we had a disagreement or difference of opinion.
17. Teasing. She her whole life has never been able to be teased or take things as a joke about herself. I was very mindful of this but thought it was odd.
18. Appearance. She was obsessed with how she looked. Mind you she was stunning. Constantly weighing herself and focused on how good her body was. If she went over a certain weight, even by a pound, she would meltdown and feel ugly and unwanted. I always reassured her how beautiful she was but it wasn't enough.
19. Dating down. Prior to me, the guys she dated for the most part weren't as attractive. She even admitted it was ""safer"" to date them.

The last time we spent significant time together we went to dinner. She said it was wonderful and if this was a first date she would have been so excited. However she knows what I am ""capable"" of and even if I fixed things she knows this now.

At the end when we met up, she could not remember one good thing about our relationship. One vacation that she absolutely loved after-she remembered one thing negative from and it clouded everything. She said she didn't like the vacation at all pretty much. Another vacation that I had planned and took her on to an exotic destination which she liked she told me she never even wanted to go on. It was like a different person I was talking to.

It was like this person wanted the honeymoon, butterfly feeling to last forever and be 100 percent of the time. As an adult, this just isn't possible. Once a few minor transgressions happened, she seemed to see my flaws and instead of embracing me as a human-I didn't serve her purpose anymore.

I can add more to this but this is the basic lay out. It was just so odd to me that she turned on me on a dime, but I suspect it was brewing for a while. I am not perfect and am a human but I always apologized and wanted to make things work. It seemed like when I got a little depressed she couldn't handle it.  Up until the end, I was her best friend who I thought I was going to build a life with. She would literally tell me how much she loved me, and any issue was just the final walls coming down. Repeatedly up until the last days she said how excited she was to do life with me. The physical component was hot and heavy until the last day. She said when we were connected it was the greatest thing ever-but when we weren't I was too emotionally distant and she couldn't take it. Mind you, I have a relatively intense career that is constantly on my mind. It was the oddest experience of my life especially since I truly gave this relationship my all. Always honest, supportive and loving towards her.

I am late 30s and she is early 30s. It took a lot for me to open up and be as vulnerable and open with her as I was. I was always so open and honest with her. It seemed like once I showed a little emotionally intimacy ie I am a little depressed and I need her support, she ran for the hills. It was just me trying to build the intimacy and connection deeper. It was so hard from the person who your world revolved around and you planned to spend your life with just casts you aside. The last thing I said to her was I hope she finds the love she is looking for and I wish her the best. Her father was even surprised at how well I took everything. It broke my heart into pieces.

Title: Mistake
Mood: Sad / Reflective / Cinematic
Instruments: Rain SFX, soft piano (verses), heartbeat-style drums + muted trumpet (chorus)
Singing: Angelic and soft. Maybe shouting at the last chorus.
Speed: slow.

—

(Verse 1 – soft piano, rain in the background)
I left the porch light on that night,
Hoping maybe you’d come back right.
But silence answered every door,
And your name’s not written here anymore.

The coffee’s cold, your chair’s still pulled,
Your jacket hangs where time once stood.
And every step inside this place
Echoes like I’ve been erased.

—

(Verse 2)
I said too much, or not enough,
And we mistook love for something tough.
We bent until the seams gave way,
And now you’re gone, I’m left to pay.

The photos on the fridge still smile,
But I ain’t felt joy in a while.
I let you down—I know I did—
A love like ours should never end like this.

—

(Chorus – drums rise in slowly, trumpet joins)
You were a mistake,
A heart that couldn’t stay.
I gave you all my light,
You threw it all away.
If I could turn back time,
I’d change the way you made me break.
But now I’m left with nothing but
This endless…
Mistake.

(Ooh-ooh-ooh…)
(Ooh-ooh…)

—

(Verse 3 – back to rain and piano)
The rain’s been falling three days straight,
Guess even the sky shares in my fate.
I whisper sorry to the air,
But all I get is the sound of despair.

I kept your letters in a drawer,
But I can’t read them anymore.
Your words don’t mean what they once did,
Not when they’re buried under all this “if.”

—

(Verse 4)
Your last goodbye still rings so clear,
But I pretend I didn’t hear.
’Cause if I face the truth too soon,
The walls might crumble with the room.

You said I’d learn, and maybe I will—
But the echo of you lingers still.
I wish I could go back and wait,
Before it all became too late.

—

(Chorus – repeat with added trumpet swells)
You were a mistake,
A heart that couldn’t stay.
I gave you all my light,
You threw it all away.
If I could turn back time,
I’d change the way you made me break.
But now I’m left with nothing but
This endless…
Mistake.

(Ooh-ooh-ooh…)
(Ooh-ooh…)

—

(Verse 5 – quieter, more reflective)
But maybe I was the one who cracked,
The one who never gave enough back.
Maybe love was never lost—
It’s just the pain that found the cost.

You gave me truth, I gave you fear,
I never let you near enough to hear.
I see it now, too little, too late…
I wore the hurt, and you bore the weight.

—

(Verse 6)
Now I’m the ghost in all our plans,
The one who let go of your hands.
I painted red flags with rose-colored grace,
And couldn’t look you in the face.

So if you hate me, I understand.
I turned your love to sinking sand.
You saved me once, I let it break—
Now I admit…
I was the mistake.

—

(Chorus – final, changed lyrics – trumpet cries)
I was a mistake,
A heart that couldn’t stay.
You gave me all your light,
I threw it all away.
If I could turn back time,
I’d change the way I made you break.
But now I’m left with nothing but
This endless…
Mistake.

(Ooh-ooh-ooh…)

(Outro – just rain and fading piano)
You were love… I was too late.
Now all we are

1kzcbrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/badreviewer/comments/1kzcbrk/likenew_amazon_fire_max_11_reviewed_realworld_test/,Like-New Amazon Fire Max 11 Reviewed: Real-World Test,"Can a like-new Fire tablet actually replace your laptop for reading, sketching, and streaming, or is this just another bargain-bin distraction? As someone who juggles note-taking, video calls, and light graphic work on the go, I needed a **budget tablet for students** that offered more than just basic web browsing.

I picked the[ Like-New Amazon Fire Max 11](https://amzn.to/4joAC2v) for its aggressive sub-$140 pricing, the promise of **tablet with stylus support**, and an 11-inch 2K display. My typical use cases include annotating PDFs in cafes, streaming lectures, and quick sketches during downtime.

# Performance Benchmarks

In our synthetic tests, the octa-core MediaTek Helio G88 inside this **Fire OS tablet review** candidate scored around 185,000 in AnTuTu, placing it ahead of entry-level slates but behind flagship Android competitors. Real-world app launches—Word, Chrome with 10+ tabs, and Zoom—remain mostly snappy, though you’ll notice occasional frame drops when switching too fast or running multiple background apps.

Gaming performance on titles like Asphalt 9 at medium settings hovered around 30–35 fps, making this **affordable 11-inch tablet** suitable for casual gamers but not hardcore action junkies. Overall, the Fire Max 11 balances responsiveness and power efficiency in its price tier.

# Design & Portability

The[ Fire Max 11](https://amzn.to/4joAC2v)’s slim bezels and 11-inch footprint yield a screen-to-body ratio of about 84%, making it surprisingly compact for an **11-inch tablet under 200**. At 1.1 lbs and 7.5 mm thick, it slips easily into backpacks alongside chargers and notebooks without adding bulk.

The aluminum-feeling rear shell (actually high-grade polycarbonate) resists fingerprints, and the rounded edges improve one-handed grip. A magnetic stylus attachment on the upper bezel provides handy storage, though the stylus itself isn’t included in the base price—a worthy optional extra for digital artists on a budget.

# Display/Graphics Quality

The 11-inch 2000×1200 IPS panel delivers crisp text and vibrant colors ideal for reading and sketching. Peak brightness of 350 nits handles indoor daylight well, though direct sun will wash out the picture—typical for **refurbished Fire Max deal** hardware. The 60 Hz refresh rate keeps UI animations smooth, and the anti-glare coating reduces reflections during long study sessions.

HDR10 support on Netflix and Prime Video enhances contrast in dark scenes, though dynamic range remains modest compared to premium tablets. Still, this **best 11-inch tablet under 200** candidate punches above its weight with accurate sRGB coverage around 92%.

# Battery Life & Charging

With a 7,000 mAh battery, the Fire Max 11 lasted 10 hours of continuous video streaming at 50% brightness—on par with many midrange tablets. Casual web browsing and note-taking sessions stretched beyond 12 hours, making it a reliable **budget tablet for students** powering full-day classes without outlet hunts.

Charging via the included 18 W USB-C adapter reached 50% in 90 minutes and full charge in just over 3 hours. Quick-charge support isn’t lightning-fast, but it’s adequate for overnight top-ups or coffee-break boosts.

# Hardware Specifications

Key specs for this [Amazon Fire Max specs](https://amzn.to/4joAC2v) slate include:

* Processor: MediaTek Helio G88 (2×2.0 GHz + 6×1.8 GHz)
* RAM: 4 GB LPDDR4X
* Storage: 64 GB (expandable via microSD up to 1 TB)
* Display: 11″ 2000×1200 IPS, HDR10
* Ports: USB-C (charging/data), 3.5 mm headphone jack
* Wireless: Wi-Fi 5 (Dual-band), Bluetooth 5.3

The expandable storage option keeps this **affordable 11-inch tablet** flexible for media-heavy users without overpaying for built-in space.

# Thermals & Noise

Even under full-load benchmarks, surface temperatures peaked at a comfortable 38 °C on the rear panel, thanks to efficient Helio G88 power management. There’s no active cooling—just silent, fan-less operation—making the Fire Max 11 whisper-quiet during video calls or reading sessions.

With no moving parts, noise isn’t a factor; the only audible output comes from the stereo speakers, which we cover in Additional Features (below).

# Pros & Cons

**Pros:**

* Crisp 2K display with HDR10 support
* Magnetic stylus attachment feature
* Long 10+ hour video battery life
* Expandable microSD storage slot
* Truly silent, fan-free operation

**Cons:**

* Stylus sold separately
* Modest 4 GB RAM limits heavy multitasking
* No fingerprint sensor
* Limited peak outdoor brightness

# Value Proposition & Price Analysis

At $139.99, [the Like-New Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet](https://amzn.to/4joAC2v) emerges as the clear **best budget Android tablet 2025** pick for users needing productivity on a shoestring. Compared to the Lenovo Tab M10 Plus ($179) and Samsung Galaxy Tab A8 ($199), this unit stands out as the **value leader**—offering a larger 11″ 2K screen, expandable storage, and comparable battery life at a lower price point.

# Final Verdict & Recommendation

  
The[ Like-New Amazon Fire Max 11](https://amzn.to/4joAC2v) strikes an impressive balance of screen quality, battery endurance, and silent operation for under $140. While power users may crave more RAM or faster charging, most students and casual creatives will find it a surprisingly capable everyday companion.

Would I recommend this to students or budget-minded creators? Yes—because it delivers essential tablet features without breaking the bank.

So I really would appreciate for someone to give me all those unwritten rules. 

At home (Madrid) I usually make coffee in a french press and drink it as is without milk or sugar. I used to use the traditional Italian coffee maker. But I find that, like the espresso in bars to be too intense and need to mix it with milk, so if I'm out I have the traditional café con leche (a shot of espresso with milk in a cappuccino sized cup). Is there an equivalent to either of these? What do you recommend I should try? 

Also, breakfast. What are the traditional breakfasts you have outside of home? Any decent spots you recommend around the centre (close to the port)? Are there places where you can sit down and order a coffee and breakfast without much rush? ",3,1748631245.0,napoli,5,0.8,False

1kzc7jh,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1kzc7jh/does_this_count_as_abusive_behaviour/,Does this count as abusive behaviour?,"A summary of how my Mam & Brother have treated since I was \~18 (5+ Years). My Dad definitely had narcissistic behaviour, but he's no longer involved in my life, thankfully. But I worry my current family relationship isn't too much healthier,

My Mam:

  
My Mam asks me to do really mundane things for her, on a daily basis, often multiple times a day, despite the fact she can do them herself. I think it's a case of her being used to having everything done for her when it was actually needed in the past.

  
I know she's often sore after working, as it's 12 hour manual shifts, and I'm willing to help on the days she's working, but even when she's off work which is often for 6 days at a time, she still expects me to help just as much.

Putting away cutlery and keeping the kitchen tidy is fair enough. However, her expecting me to cook prepared food when she's off work seems like laziness. There have been times she's been in the Kitchen with me and still asked me to cook food for her, claiming it's better than when she makes it herself, when all I do is follow the straight forward instructions on the packet. 

She also expects me to wait for deliveries on non work days, sometimes just because she's tired, as she hasn't slept well the night before, when I wanted to do something myself that day. She will then say I can still go, but I feel compelled to stay otherwise I'll feel selfish.

On the financial side, 100% of my PIP (disability) money which is a substantial amount all goes to her bank account, along with 20% of my Universal Credit (unemployment)

The Universal Credit used to be nearer 25% but I lowered it over a year ago, and still every months she asked why I lowered it. I wouldn't be so bothered if the money went to a savings pot for me, but it doesn't. It goes to my Mam.

The PIP goes to her bank account as she was made an appointee 10 years ago - she is supposed to manage the finances in my best interest.

5 Years ago there was a substantial sum of money awarded for a delayed PIP claim which went to her account, I saw maybe 5% of it. 25% went onto the garden, which I don't use, and the remainder went on decorating her room and my brother's, and seemingly not much else.

Also on the financial side, my brother has a well paid NHS job, and doesn't contribute any money towards the household.

My Brother

My Brother is 5 years older than me, and we are constantly clashing. He has picked up on a lot of the negative traits my Dad had, and it makes me very uncomfortable. He has seemingly assumed my Dad's job since my parents divorced (due to cohesive control).

He will pick arguments over the smallest things, and then say I'm childish when I get upset and to act my age. One of the most ridiculous things he argued over was claiming I wasn't polite to a delivery driver when I was, calling me a liar when I corrected him because he didn't hear me, and then tried to make me feel bad for the driver when I did nothing wrong. 

Unfortunately, that type of behaviour is recurring. It is now at a point where I will actively avoid being in the same room as him, and if it's unavoidable I will freeze up. Stop eating, stop playing my YouTube video etc, and sit in silence scrolling through Facebook till he leaves and I feel tense when he is in the room. He can't complain about me doing nothing, so that's what I do.

Because of the above clash, I will also actively avoid telephone appointments when he is off work, I feel like he will listen in and then say I said something that wasn't appropriate, I've had that happen before with both him and my Mam and it's uncomfortable. On days when he is off work, I will also stay at home, even though I'm uncomfortable, as I don't want him in my room without permission, as if he finds personal items I don't want to, he will make a big scene saying he wouldn't have found them if my room was tidy and didn't need cleaning.

I mentioned earlier he doesn't contribute to finances, and whilst he sometimes helps with household maintenance, he is very slow. It can take weeks to dispose of rubbish - coffee machine box's, old air fryer etc, and months to put up a doorbell (one of the ones that need to be drilled in to the wall to secure).

\----

I think at least some of the above behaviours from my Brother / Mam are abusive, and toxic. 

So I am currently considering moving out, but I feel like that would be selfish as then my Mam wouldn't have the financial and personal support I provide her, even though that shouldn't be my job.",5,1748631068.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

# CASE FILE: THE MIDNIGHT FRAME

**Date Opened:** November 3, 1947  
**Location:** Los Angeles, California  
**Case Number:** LAPD-47-113

# 🚨 CRIME TYPE:

**Age:** 29  
**Occupation:** Aspiring actress, jazz club singer  
**Residence:** Studio apartment above The Blue Dahlia Lounge, Downtown LA  
**Time of Death:** Between 11:30 p.m. and 12:15 a.m., November 2  
**Cause of Death:** Gunshot wound to the chest (close range, .38 caliber)  
**Body Found:** Back alley behind The Blue Dahlia, wrapped in a mink stole, makeup still fresh

#  PRIMARY LOCATIONS:

* **Chateau Hollywood**: Hotel known for discreet affairs. A rendezvous location for elite and shady types alike.
* **Templeton’s Apartment**: One-room flat above the lounge. Ransacked.
* **Studio Backlot**: Veronica had a walk-on role in a noir picture — possible Hollywood connection.

# SUSPECTS:

# 1. Jackie Rayburn

* **Occupation:** Lounge pianist, ex-lover
* **Motive:** Jealousy and heartbreak — Veronica left him for someone with “money and pull.”
* **Alibi:** Claims he was at a nearby diner drinking coffee alone. No one remembers seeing him.
* **Evidence:** Powder burns on his jacket sleeve. Claimed it was from ""fireworks rehearsal.""

# 2. Miles Remington

* **Occupation:** Studio executive at TriSun Pictures
* **Motive:** Veronica threatened to expose their affair — and the contract he illegally forged on her behalf.
* **Alibi:** Said he was home with his wife in Beverly Hills. Wife is “unsure” of the exact time.
* **Evidence:** His engraved gold lighter was found under Veronica’s body. Smells of Cuban tobacco.

# 3. Evelyn DeWitt

* **Occupation:** Actress, co-star in same film
* **Motive:** Professional jealousy — Veronica’s star was rising faster. Rumored to be getting Evelyn’s role recast.
* **Alibi:** Claims to have been on set for reshoots, but the director says she never showed.
* **Evidence:** A torn script page marked “Scene 4 – Gun prop loaded” was found in her dressing room.

# 4. Detective Frank Calder

* **Occupation:** LAPD Homicide Detective (assigned to the case)
* **Motive:** Dirty cop on the take — had connections with both Veronica and Remington. Rumored to have been blackmailed by Veronica.
* **Alibi:** Claimed to be “working late” at the precinct. Logs don’t back it up.

* Smudged lipstick on a highball glass with Evelyn’s fingerprints
* A prop gun swapped out with a real one in the studio’s supply
* .38 caliber bullet casing found next to the body — matched to Jackie’s stolen revolver
* Faint perfume trace (Chanel No. 5) found in Miles’s car backseat — same as Veronica’s

# MOTIVE SUMMARY:

* **Love turned sour**
* **Power plays and professional sabotage**
* **Secrets traded for silence — and silence bought with blood**

#  INVESTIGATION NOTES:

The case hangs on the timeline — four suspects, four conflicting alibis, and one victim who knew too much about all of them. Each suspect had a reason to want her gone. The killer didn’t just silence a voice; they tried to erase a threat.

But in 1947 Los Angeles, the truth doesn’t stay buried long.

Got any ideas?

I stopped drinking coffee but I changed to tea 3 years ago (cos my dumbass thought the trigger was coffee not caffeine).

Recently 2 weeks ago I just realized caffeine is a trigger and started cutting off caffeine completely. I have tried my best to cut off from other trigger and ate meals that normally do not trigger Gerd but I cant guarantee 100% if I did it. After cutting off caffeine, I realize I have been having watery diarrhea for the past 2 weeks when I consume L-Glutamine. I have started taking following supplements to battle Gerd for 1 month now and previously my daily stool is fine.

Here are the list of supplements:

Morning   
\-Vitamin C acid-free (Self medication - thinking I may have vitamin C deficit due to gerd for 13 years)  
\-Vitamin E (Self medication)  
\-Iron (Self medication)  
\-Magnesium Glycinate (Self medication)  
\-Probiotic (Good for gut recovery)  
\-Prebiotic (Good for gut)  
\-Colostrum (To build resistance against cancer)

Morning and evening  
\-Calcium Citrate (Health checkup shows im lacking calcium even though I drink oat and soya milk daily)  
\-Omega 3 (Self medication)

With food 3 times daily  
\-L-Glutamine (Good for gut recovery)  
\-GI Relief (I heard it helps a lot of people to fight Gerd)

I am currently jobless and don't intend to be for too long. I would like to take advantage of not being stressed out easily and just try to recover from Gerd.

Thus my question is daily watery diarrhea a good thing? My assumption right now is becos its getting rid of bad virus in my stomach in order to slowly heal my gut. Any thoughts or recommendations are appreciated. Just sick and tired of Gerd ruining my life.",0,1748631014.0,GERD,8,0.33,False

When it comes to eating, things like doughnuts and carbs don't seem to bother  my stomach, sometimes I can force myself to eat a piece of pizza, or chicken, but it's as if my stomach goes, ""something nutritionally dense?!?!?!! HOW DARE YOU!"" 

Anyone else struggling to eat anything? I ate five saltine crackers and part of a cup of coffee. One doctor recommended I try eating plain rice for an entire week, without any butter to see if it helped - having the mental stamina to do that with how the everything else is going has been really challenging but I'm going to make an attempt again.

First the guy taking the order had no clue what a BLT was. So we started to explain what it was and he stopped and said the Italian would be the closest. I then pointed out the build your own option, that he didn't know was on the menu. So then it took almost 5 mins to explain how to make it. So we paid and went to order two rasberry black and gold teas separately because he said the system wasn't printing to the drink side. I looked at the sandwhich receipt and saw it said no tomatoes for the BLT, so I had to go back over and tell him to put the tomatoes on the sandwhich. We get the sandwiches and go to eat them and we asked for little may on the BLT and it had a big glob of mayo. The Italian had all its meat piled in the center, leaving inch of bread on each end. We leave and take a drink of the teas and they tasted more like lemonade and there was no raspberry flavoring at all.

Currently unemployed and thriving. Taking a break before I go corporate again. And wow, what a peaceful life it is when you’re not dating. No stress. No overthinking. No crying in the bathroom because someone “didn’t mean it like that.”

People say, “Maybe you’re just dating the wrong people.” Correct.
But also: Maybe I’m not meant to date. Maybe I’m just meant to vibe.

Never got flowers. Never had surprise McDo. Not even a pity fries drop-off during PMS season.
I had one ex, lots of dates and talking stages—serious, casual, exclusive—pero wala talaga. As in zero. Zilch. Waley.

And it hits HARD at 1AM. My soul be like, “Bakit wala ni isang tao nagpadala ng Chicken McDo with spaghetti sa’kin out of love??”

A month ago, my friends and I were studying at the library when an older man in a wheelchair (maybe 60s-70s) started talking to us. He seemed friendly at first—asked about our studies, future plans, etc. He complimented my smile and called me “joyful.” I didn’t think much of it since I try to be polite and upbeat, especially with older people.

But some of his comments were off—he called my friend’s name “sexy,” said I had “exotic features” (I’m Egyptian), and kept repeating how pretty and attractive I was. We couldn’t really leave the convo (it went on for like 30 mins), but afterward we all agreed he seemed like a lonely guy who liked chatting. And I guess we might’ve had a bias to ignore odd comments cuz he’s old and in a wheelchair.
He’s also not directly creepy, more indirectly. He seems like a knowledgable charismatic person.

Later, he approached me, called me “Egyptian princess,” and gave me a book recommendation. Still odd, but I tried to be polite.

The next day, he asked my friends where I was and was seen wheeling through the library rows, seemingly looking for me. My friend messaged me to look away and put hood up. When I eventually walked by, he stopped me, squeezed my arm, and asked if I wanted to go to lunch to “get to know each other better.” I made an excuse and left—he squeezed my arm again when saying bye.

Since then, he’s popped up a few more times, offered me coffee, keeps calling me “Egyptian princess,”. In the past week, he has asked my friends about me when I’m not there (e.g. “How’s our Egyptian princess?” and “When’s Miss ___ coming back?”). He’s also so my friend in town and stopped to ask how I’m doing. My friends now try to avoid him and give dry responses.

I’ve stopped going to that library, but I still feel weird about the whole thing. I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but it’s starting to make me really uncomfortable. Im worried it will turn into something more lol. Am I looking into it too much?

Opinions welcomed.,"Hey everyone. I’m feeling disappointed in pretty much all of my friends and family at the moment. 

I’m not one to play victim as I believe some people are a glutton for punishment, and should take responsibility for their own (inter)actions.

I’m very understanding of that fact that most of my friends work AND have children (and I don’t have kids). Also understanding of family members who either aren’t 100% in health, or work demanding jobs, or are airy fairy student types… but I’m SO SICK of always checking in on them first. Asking what’s new. Asking when they’re free to meet for a coffee.

My sister (21F) replied today to a text I sent her TWO WEEKS AGO asking if she wanted to hang out this coming weekend.  She’s usually at Uni in different city but is back for the summer. I never hear from her when she’s out of town and I let it slide since she’s so much younger, and I appreciate that talking to her big sister might not be high on her social agenda. Whenever we do actually hang out we get we get on so well and I love her to pieces! 

Since she returned in April I’ve seen her twice (she’s not working by the way). Once to help set up our mum’s small birthday party, and again to help clear the house a bit. No comms outside of this. 

She replied with “hey!!! Sorry I’ve been super busy and didn’t see your text. Sorry I can’t hang this weekend I’m visiting my boyfriend or I totally would!” (bf still at his uni in a different city). 

I’d had it by this point so I replied with “Two weeks. There’s busy, then there’s just inconsiderate, especially when someone else is trying to make an effort. Everyone has stuff on but it takes 2 seconds to reply, even if you can’t make it or to say you’re not feeling 100%, which I’d be understanding of. Have some courtesy.”

No reply since (obviously).

But it’s not just her. It’s most people. It hurts because whenever we do speak properly, or meet up with these people it’s lovely and we roar with laughter and they’re all “gosh it’s crazy at the moment! I’m so sorry it’s been so long, but it’s been amazing catching up!”.

These are people I’ve known YEARS (or my whole life!), and have had the deepest conversations with. I had to have an emergency appendectomy last year and they really showed up for me, and I’ll be forever grateful. 

But after that, back to usual. The most I usually get is a meme or funny clip sent to me. Not actually asking after me. I think I would feel unreasonable messaging them with “I just feel sad, that whilst you’re busy with a hormonal teenager and a toddler, and also work, and are working to stay on the wagon, that after all these years of friendship you don’t take the time to text ME”…. 


I have a lovely encouraging partner, we live together and have pets and our own thing going on - so I’m not twiddling my thumbs, but the resentment for others has just been building gradually.


I’m sure you’re thinking “they’re just used to you messaging first!” … but don’t they want to know how I am if they haven’t heard from me in a while? Or maybe you’re thinking “just meet some new friends!”. You’re talking to the woman who doesn’t like sports/outdoorsy stuff, games, cooking, crafting. Transparently, volunteering sounds like a hole in the head. Relaxing watching a good telly series is my preference. I work a very peopley job, and I’m just not sure I have it in me to be Tour Guide Barbie with new people…. But something has to change. 


I think I’m going to test a month of not initiating contact and see what happens. I might laugh / heart react to a meme if it’s sent… But unless it’s a genuine question I won’t reply.

Care to weigh in? 

Any personal experience? 

Perhaps the opinion from someone who’s guilty of forgetting to message friends? No hate.

My partner is heavily attached to the couch, so I've been trying to find furniture that matches the arts & crafts/mission stickley style (?) to replace the side and coffee table with something smaller. Posted a collage of things I've saved that I'm considering as options. 

We've thought about reupholstering the couch but also thinking of just changing the cushion covers out for a different color... and maybe replacing the pillows? 

I'd also like to keep the console, which according to Google is retro farmhouse?? If its feasible to paint it to help match better, I'm open to that... but ideally there's a way to make it mesh as is. But if it's too much of an outlier/blocker to a clean look, we'd sell and replace the console. 

I typically prefer warm tones (other rooms are warm), but am thinking of going with blue shades here based on console color... or green. Put some rugs in the collage I'm considering. 

Definitely notice the shelves are off on the TV wall/entrance spot, and mismatched. I'd like to hide as much clutter (shoes, entry drawers) as possible with good storage options.

So here's a self lore first 

Let's start with that I'm a very logical person. At some point I didn't believe in gods and entities that did not have any coherent logical reason, I like mythology especially greek and Norse and see them as parts or fragments of the past. 

However! As I grew up I HATED SPIDERS. but I don't want to kill them I fear them. They always jumped scare me since I was a child, I had vivid memories that they would fall on me during times I cried in the shower, or run up the stairs chasing me when I got back home. A random spider always appearing in my room despite all my doors and windows closed and usually they be chilling close to my headboard or under my bed. I am taking a science related course and my university sits in the middle of a forest.... Not unusual to find things here right?

But big ass forest spiders. Tree spiders. I win the lottery to stumble upon them when I'm just trying to go home from the lab. Snakes appearing when I'm crossing the street and ect. Sightings of insects and wild animals aren't rare but if you asked a student how many times have they seen a chilling spider in a usually vacant tree in the middle of the park on a random Wednesday it's not 
Really supposed to exceed your fingers.

And cobwebs everywhere. I clean and dust on my good days (atleast once a week as I'm a busy person but I do throughout cleaning on  good days, unless I'm mentally unwell and I rot in my room for a month or so.)

My interest in loki got more fiery around highschool and marvel Loki despite yes being a fictional character got me hooked further as he represents  favourite Norse aesier. Then the rick Riordan books, I was interested in it especially on the Magnus chase series upon knowing that Loki is represented in it.

I also liked burning stuff. Not the arson kind but  the kind that when I  cook anything or something  sweet, i had the habit to chuck it into the fire because it felt right. 

(I'm sorry if I'm quite scatter brained I'm trying to pull out as much info as I can to help you guys understand or curate a response to my post)

Now all this came to a curious conversation this year around march. I have good friends that introduced me to diety worshiping. And one of them suggested that maybe Loki was reaching out to me this whole time. Backtracking my late mother used to tell me bedtime stories about our supposedly elders that used to be  practitioners of spiritual customs, which unfortunately was discontinued around their generation. 
After thinking about it and how my friends encouraged me to try, I tried asking, and  praying for signs. After almost a decade of turning my back to worshiping any diety as my life always felt like it was some god's sandbox, I decided to try worshipping Loki, or just actually try to ask if they're indeed calling me.

So I tried learning about my favourite god again, Loki. Reread everything that is left and are existing of their folk and history. Norse stories , and archives of what humans have found of their existence. 

Then slowly I built them a small altar in my room and lit my first candle. Researched on what people noticed they like as offerings.

The next part this is where I am confused and hope to ask guidance for 

I'm unsure of the feeling. I am a logical person but I trust my gut as it felt right at times. Additionally my dreams are most of the time so accurate it's scary (example was when I was younger I dreamt that I took a test and got wrong answers on numbers I vividly remember from the dream, the next morning I changed the answers for those questions and actually ended up with perfect scores.)

For their altar I tried to go with a gut feeling looking for a small plate for their offerings first, I was amazed when it felt like I was being lead to a shop where it only sold these small plates in an emerald green color. Then a red toy car felt like a nice touch that I saw in the shelves of the same shop. There's this kind of pull towards me on some days, like a random shopping day and suddenly I want to buy a gold pen , ect.

Food offerings; I would usually make coffee for them with cinnamon on Saturdays or share my food when it felt like ""hmm.... Does my dear god want some?"" 
Nuggets, chocolates , food I cook, ect. But yes it's always the savory and the sweet ones that felt like oh I should burn it on their offering plate.

And when I started praying to them for guidance and working through research on tiktok and other platforms (I know tiktok is not reliable most times,  but my birdbrain had to learn somewhere)
I started dabbling on prayers and sigils

tried to learn basic sigil making and spells. Trying with the extent of my knowledge on younger futhark and old Norse to make genuine prayers in form of sigils...

Ever since seeking guidance from them life has been a slight roller coaster but it didn't feel as heavy as before, the spidersssss THE SPIDERS THEY'RE GONE OR JUST SMALL BECAUSE I HOPE IT IS WHAT I THOUGHT IT IS. THE FIRST PRAYER I UTTERED TO THEM WAS TO PLEASE IF HE WANTS TO SEND A SIGNAL JUST SMALL SPIDERS.

But dear lord at one time I travelled and had to leave my place for long, the night before I left A BIG ASS SPIDER THE SIZE OF MY HAND SNEAKED INTO MY ROOM I ALMOST FAINTED. BUT I realized maybe if it was Loki's work was it their way to protect my place because I was to leave? 
(I apologise to them after returning from my trip upon realizing this, because honestly the panic attack I almost had made me slightly resent them thinking they're pulling something like a prank on me after I said no spiders)

There are days when I do cleansing spells and such when I try to feel or look for their presence I feel this mix of yearning for warmth and a feeling of warmth at the same time. It feels empty like whatever feels cold I have the need to place warmth to it with a gesture or a hug, and at the same time it feels like it is me that needs it. 

So yes... This is I guess me sharing my experience and also asking those who worship them and those who worship other deities if I'm on the right track?",4,1748630584.0,lokean,2,1.0,False

1kzbych,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1kzbych/listening_to_your_inner_voice_practical_ways/,Listening to Your Inner Voice: Practical Ways?,"Hey MaximizeMe fam! Ever feel like you’re caught in a swirl of noise—opinions, deadlines, social media buzz—making it tough to hear your own inner voice? Trust me, tuning into your intuition isn’t just some woo-woo idea; it’s a skill, and it’s *crucial* for leveling up your life. Here’s a practical, no-fluff guide to help you listen to that inner compass and make decisions that truly resonate with YOU.

**1. Create Quiet Moments Daily**  
In our hyper-connected world, silence is a rare gem. Start by carving out 5-10 minutes a day just for yourself—no phone, no distractions. This could be meditation, journaling, or simply sitting quietly. These deliberate pauses help you sift through mental clutter and hear your authentic thoughts.

**2. Journal Like Your Life Depends On It**  
Grab a notebook or launch a notes app and ask yourself daily questions like “What’s really on my mind?” or “What feels right right now?” Writing untangled thoughts often reveals patterns your conscious brain misses.

**3. Practice Mindful Observation**  
When you catch yourself reacting strongly (good or bad) to something, pause and ask why. Your immediate feelings are signals from your inner voice guiding you toward what aligns with your values or needs.

**4. Learn to Trust Your Gut—But Verify**  
Your intuition isn’t infallible, but it’s invaluable data. When something feels off or right, note it. Then cross-check facts, context, and past experiences before acting. This partnership between intuition + logic is a power move for any decision.

**5. Limit External Noise**  
Social media, news overload, and even well-meaning friends can drown out your mental clarity. Set boundaries: mute groups, unsubscribe, and create “off-grid” times. The less noise, the louder your inner voice becomes.

**6. Embrace Solitude Adventures**  
Try solo activities—hiking, traveling, or even just a coffee date with yourself. Being alone forces you to rely on your own thoughts and feelings, strengthening that internal dialogue.

---

Now, if you want a structured approach to build habits that amplify your ability to listen to and trust your inner voice, I found something awesome—this 12-month personal growth plan over at [Whop’s All Day Plan](https://whop.com/all-day-12-month-plan/?a=liveitupdeals). It’s like having a coach in your pocket, guiding you month-by-month to maximize your mental clarity and life decisions.

We frequently have people who simply have no other purpose in this subreddit other than to advertise Zen. They wake up, make a cup of coffee, groggily stumble to their Linux based desktops, open up the ArcBrowser subreddit, and try to shove their nasty Firefox clone down our pure, Chrome based lips.

TBC isn't doing any new major development on Arc. Ok, and? If I squat 405lbs, and I make zero progress, I'm STILL stronger than 99.99% of people. Arc squats 405lbs. Zen does half-rep body weight squats.  
  
Zen hasn't even copied **basic** features from Arc yet. You STILL cannot organize tabs into folders.

Oh, but let me guess... \[insert feature\] will be coming out soon? 

For you 1% of Zen users that actually work a job (because we all know most of you live in your moms basements): once you start accepting IOU's as payment, is the day we'll consider switching to software based on empty promises.

Arc is playing 5D chess with browser design. Zen is still trying to figure out how the horsey piece moves.

Question: Do you see anyone going to the r/Cheese subreddit and spamming r/dairyfree? Do you see us going into the r/bald subreddit and telling them to checkout r/wigs? Do you see us going into r/linux and telling them about r/ICleanedMyRoom and r/Shower? No, you don't.

Is the 'Zen' in Zen browser referring to the state of blissful ignorance you need to be in to think it's a viable alternative?

At the general store, he purchases supplies—flour, coffee, and a new pair of gloves—while exchanging nods with familiar faces, though some townsfolk cast wary glances. Jack then visits the blacksmith to repair a horseshoe, chatting briefly about the upcoming cattle drive. At the post office, he sends a letter to his sister in Louisiana, a rare connection to family. Before heading back, he grabs a quick meal of beans and cornbread at a saloon, ignoring hushed whispers from a few patrons. By late afternoon, Black Jack returns to the ranch, checks the herd, and mends a fence under the setting sun, his quiet resilience shaping another day in the rugged frontier.

basically im asking if anyone knows what the fuck she was on about? if it helps im based in southwest england (bc ik coffee specs can change regionally)

our mixed results were
-small milk based drink somewhere inbetween a flat white and cortado size
-a long black

The kitchen/Living/Diner is a vaulted space with one light in the center of the room coming down from the apex of the ceiling. The light is located approx where the ‘8.46’ is on the plan. The room would be an octagonal space but the doors to the balcony bisect the room to make it pentangular. The kitchen island seems awkwardly placed and sized. It does have a pop up extractor to deal with cooking fumes from the hob, which is a gas burner. The fridge is under the counter to the left of the sink. The 1/2 size dishwasher is to the right of the sink. There are 2 ovens, microwave and coffee machine in the angled cabinets. (We could lose an oven and the coffee machine and not cry about it.)

At the very least I’m going to need to run some track lighting over the kitchen so I can see what I’m cooking, but the more I pick at the layout the more I’m starting to think it might need a complete redo. Any thoughts/suggestions/ experiences with angled rooms?

Turns out I wasn't on until 4pm today, middle of a 9 day work ""week"" I had been trying desperately to find coverage for to break up the 9 days. 
Two weeks ago I lost it in BOH after an awful customer tried to treat me like an ATM. Went to the back, screamed and punched the air. Startled a coworker. (That was another scheduled over 6 days week, where we didn't have AC, and someone under ordered milks, and it was graduation weekend in the college town close by. Our city has all the ""affordable"" hotels, so we were slammed. Oh and that was the day our Dyson was stolen and we had to close the restroom. 😅
Fast forward to this week, 2 days on warming with one working oven, the ticket printers werent working after a tech came to ""fix"" a breaker and then did something on his computer, scurried away, and bam, printers werent working. But atleast THAT got fixed quickly by my shift. The shots are pulling slower than usual... Etc etc.i think the broken blender/1 blender was this week too. 
Anyway, half way through my 9 consecutive days, I wake up early to catch the bus that isn't all that reliable, get in to work my usual 30 mins early to drink my coffee/eat and center myself. And there are so many coworkers on the floor, manager too. They all look at me with big old question marks and I'm asked why I'm like 9hrs early for my shift. And I just broke. Manic laughter so bad I had to go to BOH because regulars and coworkers were staring at me. Someone made a joke about how I must feel like I live here now with a 9 day schedule. Collected myself enough to drink a coffee and eat some food because damnit, I came all this way on the bus, the least I can do is get a coffee and some food out of the journey. 
Then I started hyperventilating on the bus, thinking about how I have work in 9hrs. Definitely lost my marbles today. So then a coworker texted saying they wanted to help me (and themselves) by taking my shift, but it would put them at overtime. We both texted I've of the shifts who saw me low-key lose it that I really need someone to take my shift. Got texted to call. Called. Told him about the hyperventilation on the bus, current heart palpitations and thankfully was told to take care of myself and the shift would find coverage. Now when I go in tomorrow I'll find out if my coworkers have negative views if mental health issues (CPTSD, ADHD, and all the comorbidities that go with that, like manic depressive disorder, which is definitely what was triggered when I found out I was 9hrs early). If I hadn't been scheduled 9 days straight, I probably wouldn't have cracked. Would have just brushed it off, and come back later. But damn do I need this mental health day. Especially after the shit show the past 3 days. But, now I'll have only 6 days in a row. Too bad I already commited to and from work today and was on the verge of a full mental breakdown.


Take care of yourselves, partners. Take your mental health seriously, and hopefully your management takes your mental wellbeing seriously too. I think the amount of neurodivergent in my store helps a bit with my boss recognizing the importance of mental health, when it's brought to her neurotypical attention ",3,1748629471.0,starbucks,0,0.8,False

1kzbg6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransLater/comments/1kzbg6a/leaving_home/,Leaving Home,"I’m often asked why I chose a quiet corner of British Columbia—a place so small that its heartbeat is measured in forest whispers and mountain shadows—to begin my transition. On paper, I had everything: fourteen years of unwavering support, familiar faces who knew my story before I even found the words for it. Why tear that safety net down? But the answer wasn’t in leaving shame behind—everyone understands me now—but in chasing a deeper call: the promise of a grand adventure, a chance to meet myself anew.

Stepping off the bus into that crisp, winter air, I imagined a gilded cage: polite smiles, curious glances, and a life lived half-hidden behind practiced grace. In my mind, I’d spend lonely evenings tracing cold windowpanes, longing for the warmth of old friendships that felt just out of reach. Instead, I found a tapestry of voices—welcoming, vibrant, insistent—telling me I belonged exactly as I arrived.

Within weeks, I was weaving my story into theirs. Cupcakes and coffee at the local bakery turned into laughter echoing through sunlit patios. Morning hikes through mossy trails became moments of shared vulnerability, where tears were as welcome as jokes about my terrible sense of direction. These were friendships born not of pity or obligation but of genuine curiosity and respect. Here, my name was Willow—not a role I was playing, but the truth I have to live.

I think back to the people I might have been: the daughter who patiently waited for the right moment, the friend who never quite let down her guard. Had I stayed, they’d have loved me, but always through the lens of yesterday’s expectations. I would have been cast in someone else’s play, memorizing lines that didn’t fit. Sure, there’s hope that they would learn new acts, but hope and certainty are different currencies altogether—one fragile, the other unshakable.

I’ve met others in this town who remain trapped in two worlds: the person they present at home and the person they must become elsewhere. They talk about closets built of fear and a daily performance that deepens dysphoria instead of easing it. My heart aches for them, but my spirit soars knowing I’ve escaped that trap. There is no back door here, no secret wardrobe waiting to close.

Now, I wake to the sound of rain on rooftops, not guilt in my chest. I walk these streets as my full self—soft voice, gentle smile, unguarded eyes. I have nothing to hide anymore: no secrets, no roles, no corners for me to shrink into. I’m simply Willow, and this town, with its sprawling landscapes and open arms, is where I learned that home isn’t a place you arrive at. It’s the people who see you, in full bloom, and celebrate every petal.

I am trying to create a realistic fictitious company to use for a business case/scenario. My ""manager"" is tasking me to create some sort of model to determine which international market we should expand our coffee trade brokerage operations. 

I would like to know the following:

1. Does creating a scenario, giving detailed (yet fictitious) slides of company background info, using AI images for slide ""contributors"", etc. give more meaning to my project? Does it demonstrate some sort of level of creativity? I want a scenario to occur, because without it, I feel there is no context to random coffee datasets. I will ensure that I will disclose the level of realism which I am using.   
2. I have outlined the project as a business case. I have already analyzed the data, wrote some R code, and created a comprehensive scoring model to rank countries based on their expansion potential. I will write a brief report on findings, have a seperate document of the code (using AI to better organize it), have two slideshows, one about comapny background, and another about my specific findings. Is this too much? Will a recrutier really care about this?

The Lindy Effect and Why 100+ Year Old Businesses Are Worth Studying

Almost 200 years ago, a soap and candle manufacturing business was started in Cincinnati, Ohio. Through innovation, acquisitions and evolving alongside changing customer preferences, it has grown into a giant with multiple household brands. Today, it is a staple in dividend growth portfolios and a company that will likely stick around for at least another 100 years. 

Procter & Gamble ([PG](http://email.stockunlock.com/e/c/eyJlIjoxMTU1OTQsImVtYWlsX2lkIjoiZXhhbXBsZSIsImhyZWYiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b2NrdW5sb2NrLmNvbS9zdG9ja0RldGFpbHMvUEcvZ2VuZXJhbD91dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249U3RvY2srVW5sb2NrK05ld3NsZXR0ZXIrLStNYXkrMzB0aCsyMDI1XHUwMDI2dXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9U3RvY2srVW5sb2NrK05ld3NsZXR0ZXIrLStNYXkrMzB0aCsyMDI1XHUwMDI2dXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbF9hY3Rpb25cdTAwMjZ1dG1fc291cmNlPWN1c3RvbWVyLmlvIiwidCI6MTc0ODYyODYwMX0/78c2c77e2bd5db72f7fe66673a92d6ccf8e561ad741aa1249024a4ba115a416c)) is part of a small group of elite companies that have existed for more than a century. Among the most important traits of these businesses is that they have the ability to thrive in all environments - not only have they survived, they have grown, adapted and created immense shareholder value along the way. 

Many of these companies will arguably still be good investments for investors who are looking for low risk and high predictability (e.g., investors close to retirement), dividend growth investors, or for coffee-can portfolios.

**That brings us over to** ***the Lindy Effect***. Simply put, the Lindy Effect claims that the longer something has survived, the longer it is likely to survive in the future. 

Author Nassim Taleb describes it well. A book that has been in print for, say, 20 years, is likely to be in print for the next 20 years. But if it survives for another 10 years, one could expect it to be in print for something like 50 additional years. It is not a one-to-one relationship.

This is because the thing we are talking about, whether a business or a book, has some inherent resilience or robustness that has allowed it to survive for so long.

It has passed the test of time. 

Procter & Gamble has earned a reputation for trust among consumers over multiple centuries. The business has proven to have the best household goods within many categories, and it has stayed relevant in all sorts of environments. 

Of course, investors need to ensure management continues to run the business with integrity, staying on top of consumer preferences and treating shareholders fairly. But the resilience is undeniable.

# What are the lessons for investors?

There are a few important takeaways from these businesses.

**First, almost all have outperformed the S&P 500 and broader markets over a 35-year time frame**. Sherwin-Williams was a 124-year-old company in 1990, yet the stock has delivered an outstanding 16.4% CAGR between then and now. Over 35 years, those sorts of numbers equate to life-changing returns for individual investors.

**The point is, though, that outperformance can come from old and boring business models**. While new technology and IPOs can be exciting, they rarely outperform, even though many investors seem to believe so.  

As it ties to the Lindy effect - these companies already have proven, resilient business models. Along with capable management, those are arguably the most important traits for long-term outperformance. 

**Second, an old company does not necessarily mean low growth.**

American Express has compounded EPS at 9.6% annually over the past 10 years. Caterpillar has done even better, delivering 12.2% CAGR EPS growth over the same time frame. And Sherwin-Williams, which undoubtedly is the best example of the Lindy effect, has compounded EPS at 13.3% annually since 2015. As a reminder, that is a company selling paint. It does not get much better (or boring) than that. 

As with Procter & Gamble, many of these companies own household staples or brands that customers trust. Construction crews trust Caterpillar’s machinery. American Express remains top of mind when choosing a credit card. Coca-Cola’s drinks are everywhere. 

That provides pricing power. So, they benefit from inflation and can raise prices without losing customers. That is one part of the growth equation. 

But pricing power alone does not equate to double-digit growth over decades. Coca-Cola is proof of that - it has a bunch of pricing power, but not a lot of room for reinvestments. Volumes are unlikely to grow more than 1-2% annually, so a big part of organic growth rests on price increases. That explains why Coca-Cola has only delivered a \~4.6% CAGR in EPS growth over the past decade.

On the other hand, Sherwin-Williams has grown organically and through acquisitions, in addition to pricing. For example, its market share has increased in the residential and industrial segments. In addition, the company expanded operations in Brazil through an acquisition. 

Caterpillar has improved margins and bought back stock at times when it has traded cheaply. 

Clearly, there are multiple ways to go about growth. What matters is the reinvestment opportunity and management’s ability to execute. **That is true for all companies, regardless of age**. 

**Third**, **studying these “Lindy” companies can help you find similar businesses.**  

Illinois Tool Works is an unfamiliar name to most of us. However, the company in many ways pioneered the decentralized structure that some of the best-ever publicly traded companies later would implement. 

Among serial acquirers, decentralization is often pointed out as one of the most important factors that contribute to their success. It lets each newly acquired company continue to operate with autonomy, with minimal interference from the top. This structure also encourages lean operations, often with just a few executives in charge of capital allocation. This is the Berkshire and Constellation Software playbook that has created huge shareholder wealth.  

Of course, each serial acquirer is different. It is often a bet on the people at the top and their ability to deploy capital at sufficient rates of return. The Berkshire and Constellation business model clearly works, but the spectacular returns are in many ways also due to Buffett and Mark Leonard’s unique ability to execute the model. 

However, studying a company like Illinois Tool Works could have led investors to understand the power of this model a long time ago. 

**Further, what is interesting is that ITW is also an example of what not to do**. The company had to go through a “reinvention” cycle in the 2010s, divesting businesses that did not generate sufficient returns. The company had expanded way beyond its core markets.  

So, it also serves as a cautionary tale for companies with a similar model. This emphasizes how important it is to “buy and verify” to make sure the thesis remains intact after making an investment.

# Conclusion

There is something in the DNA of a business that allows it to survive and thrive for 100+ years. 

Each business is different, but resilience and ability to change with the environment are among the common features between them.  

Many of the lessons for investors are similar - a boring and predictable business model is evidently the most important predictor of which companies will be around a century from today. A boring industry means fewer new entrants. Additionally, at the scale of businesses like Procter & Gamble and Hershey, it becomes extremely difficult to compete with their distribution and brand strength.

Management matters, of course - as seen with Sherwin-Williams’ market share gains and Illinois Tool Works’ reinvention. That is true for all companies of all ages.

Even if investors do not find these companies attractive today, for whatever reason, it pays to study the ones that have been around the longest. 

For most of us investors, the big money will come from long-term compounding. And these companies have done just that for over a century.

I had immediate release from tension and pain after a couple of days and now, about 4 weeks in, I’ve had a really mean dull pain between my shoulder blades. 
Did anybody have flare ups of pain after it went away initially and if yea, how long did the flare ups last?

There's too many emotions tied to drinking coffee. 

I'm thinking of trying 30 days without caffeine. That way, in my mind, I can still return to it when the 30 days are up. 

Is this a bad strategy for long term quitting? 

Did any of you have an initial goal of quitting for a short period of time, only to quit permanently after hitting your goal? 

Is it worth doing 30 days no caffeine?  ",2,1748629118.0,decaf,7,0.75,False
1kzbd3o,https://i.redd.it/mb953k9pny3f1.jpeg,Duklings in flight!,"Last night before I went to sleep I set the alarm on my phone and skimmed my notifs and saw that the Dukling shipped! 

I usually get shipping confirmation the next day after purchasing but this one took a few days to arrive. No sweat. Got some black coffee with a soft top, just chilling. Gonna be 107° today. Work is gonna need some ""embrace the suck"" later 😅

Also, need to get my head wrapped around camping. Heading to the redwoods in 10 days - have to select my blades to take with me - I think I'm gonna take my Bark River Cub in 3V and my CKRT/RMJ tomahawk for camp/fire play - not sure what folder is coming along. Maybe my XM18.

Hope everyone is doing great today! Our Cortex XLs should be hitting USPS tracking this coming week!",9,1748628970.0,chineseknives,14,0.91,False
1kzbc4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1kzbc4j/exfiancé_threatened_me_with_a_molotov_cocktail/,"Ex-Fiancé Threatened me with a Molotov Cocktail, spreads Libel after arrest","Location: Michigan. My former fiancé put a Molotov cocktail in a bag full of my belongings, along with a handwritten, signed note admitting to constructing the device with a veiled threat. After his arrest, he has gone online calling me a murderer and abuser, in a desperate attempt to worm out of the felony charges. Additionally, I worry he’s doing this to hurt my business and possibly recruit someone to harm me and my family. 

He has sexually harassed several times since we’ve broken up, including sending two unsolicited nudes, admitted in text message to vandalizing a car, and  refuses to give back a cell phone I own, my great grandfather’s desk, and the engagement ring which was the first diamond ring my grandfather ever bought my grandmother. 

I’ve had to quit my new job because I realized the office was half a block from a coffee shop he frequents, and I was worried if he saw me, it could endanger the entire office. 

I’ve filed reports, but I feel like the sexual harassment, larceny, libel, and financial damages are getting downplayed because he’s a femme transmasc and I’m a masc nonbinary. I’m not sure if I should try to take those things up in civil court, especially since the estimated value of goods he stole is over $6000. 

Unfortunately , this situation has left me financially unstable, so I haven’t been able to hire a lawyer. Any advice on how to approach this situation would be greatly appreciated.",3,1748628908.0,legaladvice,0,0.71,False

I usually get a small half-caff iced coffee with 1 cream, 1 mocha and no sugar, but when I try to track it on the app it comes up as the standard way Dunkin' makes it with more than 1 of each. How do I track it? Just want to make sure I'm tracking it correctly and getting the right amount of points. Thank you in advance ☺️ ",1,1748628871.0,weightwatchers,4,1.0,False
