1oudixp,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalDealsHQ/comments/1oudixp/from_rock_bottom_to_rebirth_the_5step_counseling/,From Rock Bottom to Rebirth: The 5‑Step Counseling Framework That Helped Me Rebuild My Life,"A few years ago, I didn't think I'd ever recover.  
Every morning felt like dragging a backpack full of bricks up a hill I hadn’t chosen to climb.  

Counseling changed everything.  

It wasn’t fast. It wasn’t easy. But it *worked.*  
And through that process, I built something I call **The 5‑Step Counseling Framework That Helped Me Rebuild My Life.**  

This isn’t just therapy jargon — it’s the roadmap that took me from surviving to actually *living.*  

---

### 🧭 Step 1: Radical Self‑Honesty  
The hardest part? Admitting what’s really going on.  
No masks. No “I’m fine.”  
Just full transparency about my mistakes, fears, and pain.  

Once I stopped editing my story, healing finally began.  

---

### 🪞 Step 2: Emotional Awareness  
We can’t heal what we can’t feel.  
I learned to track my triggers like clues — noticing how shame disguised itself as “anger” or “control.”  
Awareness became my superpower.  

---

### 🤝 Step 3: Connection, Not Isolation  
Turns out “I can do this on my own” is one of the biggest lies we tell ourselves.  
Counseling helped me realize my support system wasn’t a weakness — it was scaffolding for growth.  
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.  

---

### 🔁 Step 4: Build Systems for Self‑Care  
It’s not just bubble baths and affirmations.  
Real self‑care looked like:  
• Scheduling mental health days instead of waiting for breakdowns.  
• Limiting digital overload.  
• Setting boundaries without guilt.  

These systems became my safety net — simple but worth gold.  

---

### ⚡ Step 5: Purpose‑Driven Recovery  
Healing isn’t just about “not hurting anymore.”  
It’s discovering what gives your life meaning again.  
For me, that purpose became helping others who are crawling out of their own wreckage.  

That’s why I created [**Addiction Counseling: A Path to Recovery and Healing**](https://trendwave-usa.kit.com/3d4461955f).  
It digs deeper into this 5‑step framework — the same process that turned my turning point into transformation.

---

### 💬 Quick Takeaways
Before you click away, here’s what this journey taught me:  
• Recovery isn’t linear — it loops, stumbles, rewires, and surprises.  
• You don’t need to be “fixed”; you need to be *understood.*  
• Progress thrives in patience, not haste.

The method is straightforward:

* Determine a persistent issue in manufacturing, operations, or logistics (such as ""downtime logs that waste weekends"")
* Look at how experts have already resolved issue without the use of tools or consultants
* Combine the best approach into a concise, clear, eight-page PDF that you can use right away

These PDFs are diagnostic tools, not goods.  
Verifying what is truly worthwhile to build, perhaps a dashboard, automation, or modest SaaS later on, is the true objective.

I'm doing this to see if low-cost, research-based micro-solutions can serve as a good starting point for developing larger tools.

I would like frank feedback:

* Which tiny everyday chore would you genuinely pay coffee money to automate or streamline?
* If these micro-solutions were truly useful and not overly theoretical, do you think people would purchase them?
* Or is this just another mirage created by independent hackers that falls apart as soon as they enter the market?

No hoopla about AI. No advertising. Simply put, hypothesis → test → feedback → refine.

If you’ve run similar small-scale validation experiments (paid PDFs, tool prototypes, workflows), I’d like to know what worked or didn’t.

1oudgqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/PathToMillions/comments/1oudgqo/your_1_pinterest_tip_for_print_on_demand/,Your #1 Pinterest Tip for Print on Demand?,"Alright fellow creators, let's talk about a platform that’s a genuine goldmine for high-intent traffic, especially for our niche. While everyone fights over the same eyeballs on Instagram, many are sleeping on the massive potential of Pinterest for Print on Demand. 

So what's the single most actionable thing you can do right now to get seen?

The #1 tip is to use Pinterest's own search bar for keyword research before you even design your pin. Don't just guess what terms people are using—let the platform tell you. This simple step ensures your Print on Demand products are discovered by users actively looking to buy.

Here’s your next step: Go to Pinterest right now and type a core product phrase like ""custom coffee mug"" into the search bar. Look at the autocomplete suggestions that pop up. These are your gold—real time, high volume search terms that you should immediately start weaving into your pin titles and descriptions. 🎯

Why does this work so well? Pinterest is a visual search engine, not just a social feed. Users type in specific queries with commercial intent. By aligning your content with these exact phrases, you're speaking their language and signaling relevance to the algorithm. 

For instance if ""funny golf gifts"" is a top suggestion and you sell a relevant design, you've just found your keyword. This directly puts your Print on Demand shop in front of people who know what they want.

A small caveat: don't just stuff these keywords. Write naturally, focusing on a human reader first. Sprinkle 2-3 primary terms into your description in a way that sounds helpful. Also remember that pin quality is still king a great mockup with poor SEO won't work and neither will perfect SEO on a blurry image. 🤔

Mastering this one habit can create a consistent stream of organic traffic to your store. It turns your Pinterest profile from a passive gallery into an active sales channel for your Print on Demand business. It’s a long term game but the payoff is traffic that finds *you* for years. 🚀

I had my share of awkward dates, bad luck, and just times when the vibe wasn’t there.

About me:
- 30 years old
- Biological female 
- 5’2” on a good day
- Straight 
- Christian
- Single. Never been engaged nor married. 
- No human kids 
- Curvy in all the right places, plus size
- Easy on the eyes
- No tattoos 
- Not a DDS and BBM supporter

I’m a healthcare professional (fancy way of saying I help keep people alive and functioning 🩺). During my days off, I’m probably sipping coffee or matcha at a cozy café, pretending to “study” but actually people-watching… or getting lost in a book I picked up from a bookstore.

I love wearing dresses, strolling through bookstores like it’s a sacred ritual, and going around the city with my earphones in, imagining I’m in the opening scene of a movie chzz haha. I also enjoy for fog-covered mountains, road trips with no real destination, and city lights that feel like they’re winking back at you. Oh, and dogs? Absolutely! 💯 

Currently, I’m on a mission to shed some pounds —starting with daily brisk w@lks during sunset, which has been refreshing but feels like I’m being chased by regrets (or carbs 😂). I’m considering joining a gym soon, but I believe in taking it one step at a time. I hear having a cute fitness buddy boosts motivation... so, you in? 😉 

I’m also a bit of an introvert. I recharge in quiet, meaningful spaces. But if the vibe is right, you’ll see my fun and talkative side 😂

What I’m looking for… A **SINGLE** guy who’s an equally accomplished professional, intelligent, economically secure, respectful, and can start a conversation that goes beyond “hi” and “hello”. Also, **26-37 years old** , someone warm, caring, nice, grounded, endless thoughtful, and just as pleasing to the eyes as the scenery I adore. 

Bonus if you are:
- well dressed: clean, stylish, and just the right amount of classy 👌🏻
- Single. Not in a romantic relationship whatsoever. Never been married. (Best if you can provide a **CENOMAR** when we meet 😂)
- No human kids 
- Christian (genuinely God-fearing)
- Love and/or have dogs
- Enjoy spontaneous long drives
- Can appreciate the charm of bookstores and late-night cafés
- From **Cebu City  or Mandaue City** (easier for coffee dates and spontaneous drives). 
- Not a DDS and BBM supporter

They never found anything wrong and that's why I'm here because I'm desperate and don't know what else to do or try. 

I'm a 21 years old woman, not obese or anorexic, I'm living a pretty healthy life, food wise at least because i dont eat junk food, i don't drink sodas at all anymore , i dont smoke and i don't drink coffee or alcohol and i never did. I used to walk a lot and exercise at home but lately for a year or 2 i barely move . I force myself to go out often these days and do my kilometers because Im tired of how my life is going. Im very anxious to go out alone and i don't have anyone so i still go out alone. My anxiety reached its peak 2 months ago when i started feeling dizzy out of nowhere. Suddenly at night i was on my chair relaxed and felt like my whoke body shut down and i fell on the back of my chair but i didnt faint. Got super scared and i probably had a panic attack after that. I felt dizzy after from morning to night no matter what. Felt like the ground is going off my feet for a sec or like something is wrong or like i cant keep my balance. Went to ER for this and they found nothing on CT, blood tests or ears. I had a really bad panic attack in the CT scan because i felt like my eyes cant shut and they kept flickering and shaking. After that my dizziness got worse and felt like i cant stay on my feet and just felt weird. Thats been going on for 2 months now i felt dizzy especially when i was laying down in bed mostly. Was getting better for a bit until i started getting panic attacks every night. My last visit in ER was because i thought I'm genuinely getting a heart attack. I keep having heart anxiety now thinking I'll die of a heart attack or something because my left arm keeps hurting and is tingly and so on. And i always felt pain only on my left side so that made me even more scared. Its a pain in the back of my upper arm and i feel it going down tingly to my pinky or burning. I thought its a pinched nerve but it keep having it every night which causes me to panic even more and eventually i get palpitations or heart reaches 140 bpm laying down. since i went to Er last time they did like 4 EKG s and 2 blood tests for heart attack and all were fine except that my hesrt was always over 110 , when i arrived it wad 140+/- . Im getting a monitor in a few days to rule out tachycardia or Arhytmia. Is anyone experiencing this? I see whenever i have panic attacks now my arms and legs go cold and they tingle really bad.

She met a guy (Josh) on a dating app and told me she only talks to him as a friend. Months later, I ran into him at the grocery store, added him on IG, and we started talking. We went out for coffee, and she didn’t seem bothered.

When we were still getting to know each other (before becoming official), Josh’s friends threw him a birthday outing at an amusement park. His sisters came, and he invited me when he found out about the plan. I went, and someone posted a group selfie. She saw it and said me and Josh were “having a good time” and not inviting her. Later, Josh asked me to be his Valentine and got me flowers. When she saw that, she called me a dumb bitch, said it was “tough love,” and claimed I wasn’t serious, that Josh isn’t my type, and that I’m going to break his heart. Clearly, she doesn’t know my type or what I like and want.

Keep in mind, I always hung out with her, but after Josh got in the picture, she started pulling herself away from me. After she unfollowed me and stopped responding, I grew closer to his friends, and now we’re inseparable. She got upset again after learning we went to Japan together.

Been thinking a lot lately about that feeling of wanting to ""level up"" your life. You know, that sense that there's a better, more energized, more fulfilled version of you just waiting to be unlocked. 🔑

The trap we all fall into is thinking we need some massive, life-altering event to make it happen. We think, ""I'll start when I get a new job,"" or ""I need to move to a new city,"" or ""I have to completely overhaul my diet and gym routine all at once.""

Honestly? That’s just a recipe for overwhelm and burnout.

The real secret, the thing that *actually* creates momentum, isn't the giant leap. It's the **tiny tweaks**. The small, almost insignificant adjustments that you barely notice, but that compound into **HUGE** impact over time. 🚀

Think about it like this:

*   **Instead of ""I need to meditate for 30 minutes every day,""** try ""I will sit in silence for 60 seconds after I turn off my morning alarm."" That's it. You start the day with a tiny win instead of a screen.
*   **Instead of ""I have to clean the whole apartment,""** try ""I will put away five things that are out of place before I go to bed."" The space gets clearer, and so does your mind.
*   **Instead of ""I must read 50 books this year,""** try ""I will read one single page of a book while my coffee brews."" That's one page more than zero.

These aren't sexy, but they are POWERFUL. Each tiny tweak is a vote you cast for the person you want to become. It builds trust with yourself. It proves you can show up. And that momentum is what truly unlocks your best life. 📈

Of course, the practical side is one thing. Sometimes the biggest roadblock is the emotional and mental side of things. It's easy to know *what* to do, but it's hard when you're feeling stuck, anxious, or just don't know where to even begin with your own thoughts. I've been looking into ways to get a better handle on that internal world, because that's where the real change starts. For anyone feeling like that's their main hurdle, I found **this resource (affiliate link)** that helps map out a plan for the emotional side of personal growth. Full transparency, it's an affiliate link, but I’m sharing it because I genuinely think the framework could be a game-changer for some of you.

1oud7i4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNOLA/comments/1oud7i4/moving_to_nola_woodward_lofts_vs_typical_more/,Moving to NOLA - Woodward Lofts vs. typical more charming unit in old build,"Hi all, I’m moving to New Orleans in 2 weeks and feel unbelievably torn making a decision on where to live. Looking at an elevated 1bd/1ba unit in an older building that has only 6 units total (Victorian-style maybe? I’m not knowledgeable about architecture) right near Coliseum Square Park vs. the Woodward Lofts. 

I know many people on here will question why you’d ever consider living in a large-building complex as opposed to a space with typical New Orleans charm in what feels like a more authentic neighborhood, but at the top of my list for issues is my intense fear of roaches. I understand large “palmetto bug” ones are unavoidable in New Orleans and I’ve lived extensively in LA and NYC where I encountered them in my apartments too, but I need to limit my interaction with them inside my apartment as much as possible since I’ll be living alone and struggle dealing with them. This is why I’m considering the Woodward; with newer and freshly-maintained interiors on a level high up, it seems like a way smaller roach risk than the other spot I’m looking at. Owner of the Coliseum Square Park spot says they don’t typically have a problem with roaches, but with how many windows and with how close it is to so many oak trees (which I’ve heard attract the wood roaches), idk if I can trust him on that. I recognize it’s going to happen, but there’s a huge difference to me between a couple a year and a couple a week.

The neighborhood around the Coliseum Square Park spot (would that be considered Lower Garden District) is obviously much more charming and would be walkable to work, but there’s also only street parking and laundry onsite but not in-unit. I don’t anticipate parking being a huge issue, but would rather my car not get broken into (understand this can be a somewhat common occurrence no matter where you are as well). Meanwhile the Woodward in the Warehouse District has covered parking (although I’ve heard car break-ins still happen?) and although I’ve heard there can be traffic, I like that there are lots of coffee options so close by and it might be nice to have a gym and a rooftop. Still close to work, but I don’t know if I can walk because I’ve heard crossing the underpass to go to the Lower Garden District at dusk/evening can be inadvisable. I’ve only ever lived in big cities and am not nervous about the realities of city life that the internet catastrophizes about (crime, unhoused populations, etc) but I’m also trying to not be actively dumb, and it’s hard to get a sense of what’s safe without being there.

If anyone has lived in the Woodward, PLEASE pipe up. Overall, if I choose that just to avoid roaches and it’s still crawling with roaches anyway, I’ll be so sad. But I do like that it has the modern conveniences of better closet, amenities, in-unit laundry. It feels lame to go for that type of spot instead of one that reflects the heart of the city and culture, but I’m wondering if the trade off may be worth it. Thoughts?

There’s a coffee place nearby, I’ve got a fiver in my purse and it’s not raining so why not I think. It’ll be fun right? 

So I make myself walk the long way round so I deserve the coffee. It’s going well. The baby is content, I’m listening to my tunes and the skies are clearing as we walk. Lovely. 

First problem. People who don’t know how to park. Vans on the path. Vans blocking the drop curb. It’s like every bastard Van went “hey first time mum trying to navigate a pram in this area let’s all park there really awkwardly”. The amount of times I had to pull the pushchair into the road behind me versus push because I had no view of the road, and I’m not willing to let bubby boy go first into the street, was honestly insane. I could win the Olympic sport of turning a pram like a handbrake turn easy now. 

Second problem. The cup holder on my pram apparently didn’t come with suspension. Or any sense of managing to contain my coffee. So we’re walking back, it’s all of ten minutes, but due to the lovely pot holed paths of England, the 100 drains per 100 feet of street and, again, every drop curb being blocked, I have sacrificed about a third of my coffee to the street as every bump is throwing the liquid out the cup. The universe truly aligned on its ability to shoot record amounts of coffee out of the tiny mouth hole on the lid. The muslin I bought incase of baby spit up is now 90% latte and I’m praying my boy doesn’t choose this moment to practice his sick skills. (And no I couldn’t hand hold the coffee and push with one hand coz whoever built the roads in my area decided that they should all be on a mandatory 45% slant towards to road 🙄)

All in all, 2/10 experience and I don’t think I’ll bother with the coffee again. We will of course still venture out for fresh air but this mumma will just be taking a water bottle and never expecting to be able to cross the road with ease 🫠😅",1,1762876803.0,beyondthebump,2,0.99,False

Late 30s F, ready to mix it up and finally say goodbye to the east coast.

I only need to go into the office ~once a month, so I’m not indicating where the office is specifically. The in-office time is so infrequent I don’t mind whatever inconvenience is caused by it - would rather just focus on where I want to live.

I’d like to rent a 1-2BR for under ~3500 a month,  not sure if this is a realistic ask but I’ll be making ~$210-240k depending on bonus, and would like to stay within my budget.

Strongly prefer a townhome or small bungalow setup as I really don’t want to hear neighbors through walls and mega- apartment style living doesn’t appeal to me. If I had to do an apartment, I could handle style of the older/converted apartments where it’s a 2 story building and each unit exits directly to the outside (I have a dog so not keen on the long inside hallways).

Safety is the most important thing to me, I don’t mind driving to socialize if it means I can reside somewhere peaceful and surrounded by trees/green space and quiet.

Social aspect is the second most important factor. Ideally a part of the metro area that has other singles in their 30s/40s, where it’s not all families and not all fresh-outta-college people. A mix is nice. I would like to be able to date and understand that because of traffic many guys aren’t interested in dating beyond their convenience radius.

Outside of work, I enjoy golf and nature photography, just taking random walks through new parts of town, museums, any kind of cultural event. I appreciate a nice cocktail but not at all into nightlife culture. I don’t expect being able to golf much once I move given the relative scarcity and extreme costs of golf in CA (cue the tiny violins, I know).

Also, I know this is a first world problem, but I’d like to be able to live somewhere I can go to target or Walmart and buy whatever I need without needing to wait for someone to come unlock it from a case. In my visits to the Bay Area it seems like everything is locked up and it’s annoying to wait for amazon to ship or wait for the bougie hipster store with overpriced products to open.

Bonus points if I can walk to a coffee shop or some basic amenities, but I don’t need any sort of dense urban walkability.",1,1762876414.0,MovingToLosAngeles,5,0.67,False

Recently I stumbled upon the site https://thisweek.to for shows happening around the city and it’s such a great resource for us city dwellers.

With this request, I’m looking for help finding another “hidden events calendar.” I’m hoping to find something similar for all the live shows, pop-up events, and music nights happening at smaller places. Some places I’ve seen it include independent coffee shops (Rooms Coffee, Ethica Coffee, Neo Coffee Spadina, etc.), hotel lobbies/bars (Shangri-La, GLB, etc.), and popular public spaces (Stackt Market, The Well, Waterworks, Distillery, Harbourfront, etc). Ideally looking for evening events to enjoy at these types of locations and am particularly fond of coffee shops that end up reopening for evening hours.

Finding these events is always a great time but sadly they’re often missed by big sites focused only on major events happening in the city. 

Does anyone know if there’s an ongoing/up-to-date tracker, aggregator, website, newsletter, Instagram, or even a solid subreddit that lists these cultural and music happenings the way thisweek.to does for venues?

Not pitching anything ; just using short, **well-researched write-ups** to test which everyday problems are actually worth building solutions for later (dashboards, automations, or tools).

Each “fix” starts as an 8-page summary:

* Pinpoint one recurring headache (like “shift reports that eat weekends”)
* Look into how other plants or operators deal with it
* Boil down what works into something you can read and use during a break

These PDFs are just *diagnostic tools*, not products. The point is to confirm what’s broken before designing heavier systems.

**What I’m looking for:**

* What’s one daily task that still feels stupidly manual?
* What process slows you down the most,  even though it’s “just part of the job”?
* What’s a fix you’d happily pay coffee money for if it actually saved you time or hassle?

No AI hype. No buzzwords. Just small, field-tested systems that might cut through the noise and make work smoother.

Hey everyone,

My wife and I recently took the plunge and started our own café — Nukkad Farms and Café, tucked away in the beautiful Leopard Trail, Gurgaon.

It’s our first entrepreneurial venture, something we’ve been dreaming about for a while. We wanted to create a cozy, welcoming space where people can unwind, chat, and enjoy good food and coffee without burning a hole in their pocket — so we’ve kept the prices as nominal as possible.

Would love for anyone around Gurgaon to drop by, give us a try, and share your feedback. We’re learning as we go, and every bit of encouragement or suggestion helps. 🙌

All big things have humble beginnings — and this is ours. 💛

Home Assistant is the brain of my smart home, but I realized I had a huge blind spot: all the other important stuff that isn't connected. My server rack components, the warranties for my smart switches, the expiry dates on my emergency supplies, even the specific model of my 3D printer nozzle.



It was all just mental clutter. So, I decided to build a solution for it, and I'm hoping to get some feedback from a community that truly understands home management. It's called Ownly.



It’s a web app designed to be an ""operating system"" for your physical belongings, with a heavy focus on AI to do the heavy lifting.

What it can do right now:

🤖 AI-Powered ""Smart Add"": This is the core feature. You snap a photo of an item (e.g., a box of medicine, your new router, a bottle of wine), and the AI does its best to identify it, categorize it, and pull out key attributes. It’s surprisingly good at finding expiry dates on food/medicine and warranty info from receipts.

📈 Consumption Tracking (Quantity Tracking): For things you use up (coffee beans, 3D printer filament, batteries for your Zigbee sensors), you can track the quantity. You can create ""Quick Action"" buttons like ""Used one tablet"" or ""Brewed coffee"" to deduct a set amount with one click.

📄 Manuals & Documents: You can upload PDFs, receipts, and warranty documents directly to an item's card. There's also an AI tool that can search online for the official PDF manual for an item and attach it for you.

👨‍👩‍👧 Shared Access: You can grant access to your inventory to family members or a partner. They can see and edit shared items, which is great for managing a household together (e.g., a shared medicine cabinet or pantry).

🎨 Customizable Dashboard: The main dashboard is a grid of widgets you can drag, drop, and resize. You can add widgets for notifications (e.g., ""Warranty ending soon!""), your most-used ""Quick Action"" buttons, a mini AI chat, etc.



The Roadmap (What I'm thinking next):

My goal is to make Ownly even more proactive. The next big steps are:

Financial Analytics: Automatically track the total value of your inventory, see depreciation over time, and generate reports for insurance purposes.

Purchase Assistance: Help you research new items by pulling in reviews and comparing prices before you buy.

Deeper AI Routines: More proactive suggestions, like ""It looks like you're running low on coffee beans, and they're on sale at \[Store\]"" or ""Based on your electricity usage, it might be time to check the filter on your smart air purifier.""

(For this community especially) An API and Integrations: This is a big one. I want to build a proper API so you could, for example, have an automation where a new device joining your network automatically creates a placeholder item in Ownly.



The Ask: I'd love your feedback!

You guys are the power users of home management. I'm not here to sell anything; I'm here because I genuinely believe your feedback could shape this into something amazing.

You can check out the app here: [https://ownly.su](https://ownly.su)



I would be incredibly grateful if you could take a look and let me know:

What do you think of the concept itself? Does it solve a problem you have?

What key features are missing for a Home Assistant user?

What kind of integrations would make this a killer app for your setup? (e.g., MQTT support? A Home Assistant Add-on? Webhooks?)



And of course, any bugs or UX issues you find!

1oucj82,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1oucj82/mf_hole/,[MF] Hole,"“Boy, you best be out that door diggin’ by the time I turn ‘round.” 

Granddaddy cracked an egg by the word *diggin’* and had it burning by *‘round*.  Salt and pepper flakes popped off the skillet.  He was too old to notice his stinging skin.  After a lifetime, pain becomes background noise.

“But Pa,” Junior groaned, “the sun’s not even out yet.” 

Junior pulled himself off the couch and onto the creaky floorboards below.  “The dark ain’t no excuse for being lazy boy.” Granddaddy said.  “I won’t tell you again, git before I take off the belt.”

Junior moved fast, slowing down only to make sure the door wasn’t slammed.  The frigid fall air brought his hair to attention.  He considered for a moment, is the belt worth a jacket?  Folding his arms, he dragged his feet through the mud.

Ol’ Bess greeted Junior with a morning *moo*.  Junior patted Ol’ Bess’s heavy head.  He picked up the rusty shovel and started scooping the mess of Ol’ Bess.  Each scoop brought that smell a little stronger, a little thicker.  Shit was stronger than coffee.

“Junior!” Granddaddy called, “Eggs done!”

Ol’ Bess left the boy a parting gift before he dropped the shovel.  He cleaned his hands by dirtying his pants, which would dry quickly in the cold wind.  Granddaddy wouldn’t notice the smell; Junior was too hungry to care.

The table was set.  Granddaddy had himself a cup of joe.  Junior had a plate full of eggs.  The smell of burnt food and fresh shit filled the house.  As Junior ate, one scent overpowered the other.

“You dig that hole yet, boy?”  Granddaddy sipped his coffee as Junior said, “Only got to Ol’ Bess so far.”  Granddaddy shook his head and pounded his mug to the table.  Coffee stained the old wood.

“I ain’t got all day, boy.  You best have learned all that you need from me because when I’m gone Ol’ Bess ain’t gon’ teach you shit.”

Junior sulked at the table, fork fiddling his eggs.  The gap between the two men driven by years.  Junior had all the time in the world.  Granddaddy was running the clock.  Daddy and Mama left too soon, and Junior didn’t have all he needed.

Snap.  Junior found himself ass to the floor before he could feel the pain.  The chair leg, rotten, had finally given out.

“You alright boy?” Granddaddy asked.

“Yeah,” Junior said, pulling himself to his feet.  Time was running out.

“I’ll fix that in time for supper.”  Granddaddy said.

Junior shoveled the rest of the eggs down his throat and swallowed hard.  The burnt yokes stuck to his throat like mud.  Luckily, he didn’t need his ass for his elbow.  As quick as he fell, he was off to dig the hole.  Not a moment too soon.

Granddaddy had outlined the hole for Junior.  There wasn’t any thinking he had to do.  Labor is simple, but the young find ways to complicate it.  Dig here, make a pile there, and die somewhere.  Junior once asked Granddaddy what happens when you die.

“You fall in a hole.”  Granddaddy said.

“What’s in the hole?” Junior asked.

“Dirt.  Regrets.  Worms that eat you.”

“Eww,” Junior made a face, “that’s gross.”

“Death is a disgusting thing, Junior.  It takes away all your joys.  All that you never was.  You go right back to where you started.  A child looking for your Mama.”

“Where did Mama go?” Junior asked with wet eyes.

Granddaddy put his hands on his thighs, sighing, “Go dig a hole boy, I’ll tell you later.”

Junior was soaked from head to toe; from sweat and rain.  His arms grew heavier with each load of dirt sent to the surface.  The guidance of elders comes with a price.  You have to take care of them.

Granddaddy rocked in his chair on the porch.  Each motion produced a song of creaks and squeaks.  The melody of old age.  He could no longer see Junior but he knew he was out there.  The flying mounds of mud were proof enough.  Each time he rocked forward, the rain tickled his nose. 

He could still feel God.

Junior had reached the bottom.  He knew this because the hole was twice as deep as he was tall.  Now he realized he forgot to put the ladder down before.  “Granddaddy,” he called, “Hole’s done.”  He waited but there was no reply.  “Granddaddy,” he called again, arguing with the rain, “can you bring me the ladder?”

There was nothing.  There was only one way out of the hole.  His ankles were submerged just as he began to dig out a slope.  When he finally made it out of the hole, the rain stopped.  Granddaddy was in his rocking chair.

Junior was righteously angry.  He stomped every step of the way.    He threw the shovel at the porch, bouncing with a loud clang several times.  “What in the hell is wrong wit’ you?” he asked Granddaddy, whose eyes were closed.

A fresh cold sweat soaked Junior.  He placed his hand on Granddaddy’s shoulder and shook.  “Wake up,” he said, placing both hands on Granddaddy now.  “Wake up!”  Junior collapsed onto Grandaddy’s lap. 

His tears couldn’t be felt.

Junior, too weak to carry the aged Granddaddy, dragged him by the ankles.  He’d collapse a few times in exhaustion.  The sun had already gone down but Junior could follow his footprints of rage from before. 

Granddaddy had taught him well.

Granddaddy arrived at his resting place in time.  Junior began filling up the hole, one dig at a time.  Now, he had all the time in the world, contemplating each sharp memory in his mind.  The love, the hatred, it all seemed so distant now.

Dirt buries everything and everyone in the end.

Crickets mourned in the moonlight.  Junior dragged his feet back through the trail Grandaddy had left behind.  His sore body fell onto the rocking chair.  Back and forth he rocked, like a child in Mama’s arms.",1,1762875319.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Distance doesn’t have to weaken a strong friendship — it simply changes the way it grows. Whether life took you to a new city, or you met someone amazing. At the same time, traveling, or your college best friend lives on the other side of the country, maintaining long-distance friendships is about showing up in different, intentional ways.

When someone matters to us, miles shouldn’t be the reason we drift apart. What really keeps long-distance friendships strong isn’t constant texting or perfect communication — it’s mutual effort, trust, and small moments of care that say, *“I’m still here.”*

If you’ve been wondering how to maintain long-distance friendships and make them last, these 12 thoughtful tips will help you stay close, even when life pulls you apart.

# 1)) Make Communication Consistent — But Not Forced

Consistency is one of the biggest pillars of any long-distance friendship. You don’t need to talk every day, but you do need to stay present in each other’s lives.

Find a rhythm that fits both of your schedules. You could text throughout the week, send funny TikToks, or have a Sunday night catch-up call. What matters most is that both people feel connected without the pressure of constant availability.

A great rule of thumb is this: consistency over frequency. You can skip a few days or weeks if life gets busy — what matters is showing up when it counts. The best long-distance friends know that love doesn’t disappear in the quiet spaces between conversations.

# 2)) Use Multiple Ways to Stay in Touch

Texting is great, but it’s not the only way to stay close. In long-distance friendships, variety helps keep the connection alive. Mix up your communication styles — send a quick voice memo, hop on a video call, or write an old-school letter when you’re feeling nostalgic.

Photos, short videos, or even shared playlists can make conversations feel more personal. You might share what you’re cooking, what the weather looks like where you are, or a photo from your walk. These small updates create a sense of shared everyday life — something many people crave when they’re far apart.

If you’re trying to figure out how to maintain long-distance friendships in a digital age, the secret isn’t just talking often — it’s making communication feel meaningful.

# 3)) Create Shared Rituals and Traditions

Every lasting friendship has its little traditions — inside jokes, nicknames, or go-to hangouts. Distance doesn’t mean you have to lose those rituals; it just means you’ll create new ones.

Try having a standing “virtual coffee date” once a month. Watch the same show and text each other your reactions. Play an online game together. Read the same book and talk about it chapter by chapter.

Shared rituals give your friendship structure and something to look forward to. They help bridge the physical gap with emotional closeness. The routine becomes a reminder that no matter where you both are, you still belong in each other’s lives.

# 4)) Be Intentional With Updates

It’s easy to fall into the “we’ll talk when something big happens” trap — but long-distance friendships thrive on the little details too. Don’t wait for major news to reach out.

Tell your friend about the new recipe you tried, a weird dream you had, or a podcast episode that reminded you of them. Ask about the small moments in their life — how work’s been, what song they’re obsessed with, or how their weekend went.

Those tiny updates may seem unimportant, but they build the sense of everyday connection that long-distance friendships often lose.

Being intentional shows care. It tells your friend: *I want to know your life, even from far away.*

# 5)) Celebrate Milestones (Big and Small)

Birthdays, promotions, new apartments — these are the moments when your friend needs to feel your presence most. Just because you can’t show up in person doesn’t mean you can’t celebrate meaningfully.

Send a handwritten card, a care package, or a simple “thinking of you” message on days that matter. Even something as small as remembering an anniversary or a stressful work deadline shows that you’re paying attention.

Celebrating milestones reminds your friend that their joy is your joy too. And in long-distance friendships, that shared excitement keeps your bond strong across time zones and years apart.

# 6)) Be Honest About the Distance

One of the most overlooked parts of maintaining long-distance friendships is acknowledging how hard it can be. There will be days when you miss them deeply or feel left out when you see them with new friends.

It’s okay to talk about that. Be honest if you’re feeling disconnected, and listen if they are too. You don’t have to fix it — sometimes, you just need to hear each other say, *“I miss you.”*

That kind of emotional honesty makes the friendship stronger. It prevents misunderstandings, reassures both people, and builds trust.

When people ask how to maintain long-distance friendships, they often expect logistical answers — but the emotional truth is just as important.

# 7)) Be Flexible and Understanding

Life changes. Schedules fill up. People get tired. One of the biggest gifts you can give your long-distance friend is understanding.

If they forget to reply for a few days, don’t take it personally. If you need space, don’t feel guilty for asking. Healthy long-distance friendships allow room for both connection and independence.

Flexibility means trusting that even if you don’t talk every week, the friendship is still solid. Distance naturally creates ebbs and flows, and that’s okay. The important thing is to reconnect without resentment when the time feels right.

# 8)) Plan Visits When You Can

Nothing replaces being in the same room, sharing food, or laughing face-to-face. Visits — even short ones — can completely recharge a long-distance friendship.

If possible, plan a trip once a year or every few months. Alternate visits or meet halfway somewhere fun. The point isn’t the frequency; it’s the intention.

When you do meet, make it meaningful. Revisit favorite spots, take photos, and savor the real-life moments you’ve been missing. Those memories will keep you both connected long after you return home.

And if travel isn’t possible right now? Don’t stress. You can still plan “virtual visits” like movie nights or meal dates. The goal is to recreate the feeling of shared presence, no matter the medium.

# 9)) Keep Growing Together — Even Apart

Friendships change as people grow, and distance can magnify that. You might be in different life stages — one starting a family, another chasing career goals — and that’s perfectly normal.

The key is to grow with each other, not apart. Stay curious about their evolving world. Ask about their challenges, hopes, and passions. Share yours too.

Try starting a shared project: a photo album, playlist, or even a journal you mail back and forth. These creative collaborations help you both stay connected through shared meaning and purpose.

A lasting friendship adapts — it doesn’t resist change, it evolves with it.

# 10)) Address Conflicts Early and Kindly

Even close friends can misunderstand each other, especially from afar. Without tone of voice or body language, texts can easily be misread.

If something feels off, don’t let it simmer. Ask gently, “Hey, are we okay?” or “Did I say something weird?” Clearing the air early prevents small miscommunications from turning into emotional distance.

Be kind, be direct, and always assume good intentions.

Conflict handled with empathy often deepens trust — because it shows you care enough to work things through instead of walking away.

# 11)) Show Up in the Ways That Matter Most

Every friendship has its own love language. Maybe your friend needs emotional support during tough times, or maybe they light up when you remember small details. Pay attention to what makes them feel cared for — and do that often.

Showing up doesn’t always mean talking every day. Sometimes it means sending a quick “thinking of you” text before their big presentation, or checking in after a tough week.

Friendship is built on the quiet gestures that say: *I see you, I value you, and I’m still part of your world.*

Those little moments are the foundation of every lasting long-distance bond.

# 12)) Remember Why You’re Friends in the First Place

When distance feels discouraging, it helps to pause and remember what brought you together. Was it shared humor? Late-night talks? The way you could tell each other anything without judgment?

Revisit those memories. Talk about the old days. Look at photos, inside jokes, or the messages that still make you laugh.

Sometimes, the best way to keep a friendship alive is to simply remind yourself why it matters so much.

The strongest long-distance friendships last because both people *choose* to keep investing — not out of obligation, but out of love and gratitude.

# Conclusion

There’s a misconception that distance automatically weakens friendships. In truth, it often reveals their depth. It teaches patience, intentionality, and the art of expressing care without proximity.

If you’ve ever wondered how to maintain long-distance friendships, the answer isn’t complicated — it’s consistent love in small, everyday ways.

Long-distance friendships aren’t defined by miles; they’re defined by meaning. They’re built on shared laughter through phone screens, late-night “miss you” messages, and the kind of bond that endures even when life changes.

When both people make an effort, distance doesn’t divide — it strengthens. Because true friendship doesn’t need proximity to feel close. It just needs two people who keep choosing each other, no matter the map.",1,1762875095.0,LifeStylenaireLove,0,1.0,False

I also own a Timemore Chestnut S3 and an MHW-3Bomber R3. The R3 is great for espresso, fantastic value for money. The S3 is a great daily/versatile grinder for pour over and can make a great cup of coffee no matter what kind of beans you have.

The ZP6 was my favorite, because I love fruit-forward, juicy coffees, especially with notes of grape, blueberry, red fruits and stone fruits. 

For espresso, I really enjoy a chocolatey, velvety, caramel, nutty and roasty shot.

That brings me to the M01. I’ve used it on two coffees so far: a natural process Ethiopian Guji with notes of grape gummies, blueberries, and bergamot, and a sugarcane decaf with notes of sugarcane and passion fruit. I usually brew the guji using the ZP6 on a V60, and the decaf I use the S3 and a Switch. I kept the brewers the same as usual for each coffee but ground both using the M01 today. 

First the Guji. With my ZP6, comes out like hot fruit juice. Very tasty, you can gulp it down without any harshness and the cup is always done too soon. The M01 kept kept 80% of that fruit juice flavor, and complimented it with a very strong chocolatey note and lingering Belgian chocolate aftertaste that was extremely pleasant in the mouth and lasted for several minutes.

For the decaf, the coffee tasted pretty much exactly how it does with the S3, but added the same pleasant, bold, chocolatey lingering aftertaste for several minutes again.

I’ve never really had coffee that married fruity acidity with chocolatey nutty notes so well. It almost feels like a pour over espresso. 

I’m very happy with this purchase. My only gripe is that the M01 doesn’t come with any kind of case. The S3 is also a Timemore product and comes with a convenient bag, and the ZP6 Special comes with an amazing protective case that has a soft insert for both the grinder and the handle. The M01 feels super premium, and I feel like it needs a protective case more than the commemorative coin it comes with. And yes I know I can put it in the box, but that box is gigantic and not convenient for going into it frequently.

So there was this girl in my office, I used to see her at the smoking area often and then I got a chance to share a cigarette for the first time and this was how it all started, it was august last year. 

I asked her out and we went for coffee and I took her to my favourite place to enjoy sunsets it felt so good and I was attracted to her before this. And we soon started talking on whatsapp then she followed me instagram and snapchat and this is how it all started and it was good for 2 3 months and then she started to show the avoidant signs which I wasn’t aware of at that time it’s actually a thing. We ended up in a relationship very fast and we both wanted it though. I also met her mom and it was sweet she was impressed and said yes to her that he’s a good genuine guy and you should go forward with this. Because we both started this relationship with planning something long term and that’s how things started.

We never went out to eat or there was someone else with us because we had couple of incidents where people from our office were there and they saw us but luckily they didn’t say a word in the office, I was okay with people seeing or talking because I never really cared, but on the other hand she used to think a lot about all this. 

She was very vocal about the financial part and how I should be the one who should pay for every time she’s with me and I was like yeah fine because I was thinking long and I didn’t have any issue spending money. 

She showed her avoidant personality in October 2024 when she went completely silent avoiding me as much as she can and that triggered my anxiety fr. I couldn’t think properly so I ended up chasing and tried hard to solve the issue but there wasn’t any issue at all. We also pre planned our trip to a place with mountains and all to enjoy winters there we bought tickets together booked our airbnbs etc and we equally paid for it. And then she got indecisive whether she wanted to continue this relationship or she should walk away but I asked her to sit and talk it out and I convinced her that everything will be okay just give some time and just don’t suppress these feelings and just talk it out whatever it is. So it worked and we ended up going ti that trip as well but she got sick and I took care of her in ways I can’t explain but you can imagine what I am saying.

Then on valentines she wrote a letter and wrote the sweetest words and in that letter she wrote this specific thing “you are the most genuine green flag energy and that makes me think that you will be the perfect father for my kids” and I got emotional and all and we enjoyed that night together.

But since October she was close then avoidant then close then silent so this was the thing I was facing till May.

And then she broke up with me over some of the silliest things one can leave and that’s what pissed me off. 

But we were no contact for one month although we were going to the same gym seeing each other in the office. But we weren’t talking or anything. And then after one month of no contact we started talking again and she asked if I am okay with doing something casual and that made me think that yeah sure what if it brings her back but it lasted for one month only and then soon after that again silence. And this went till last week when I tried one last time to see where we are standing and she said those things again and then I blocked her from everywhere. 

I miss her and I love her still and Idk how to make her come back but I can’t is there a chance for us to be together again and should I consider unblocking her or not. Please help guys.",2,1762875044.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

* What workflow would you happily pay the price of a coffee to automate or simplify?
* Which low-importance but high-annoyance issue eats your time every week?

A very rough draft but honestly, just wanted to share with people who love the series as I do. So please read and enjoy. It's short but sweet.



The phone kept ringing. But no answer came. Saga couldn’t understand it. They’d defeated Mr Scratch, Wakes body was sat there in the chair as proof. They’d put the bullet of Light in his forehead and the Dark Presence was expelled, so why was Logan not answering the phone. This should have changed everything back.  
  
Saga hung up the phone. She turned away from the writing room window and looked towards Casey. But Casey wasn’t there. In his place was a piece of paper, laid on the floor. Saga’s heart beat faster. This couldn’t be happening. Not again. She walked over, heart pounding out of her chest. She picked it up. One word stared back. “Spiral” by Alan Wake.  
  
She snapped back to Alan’s lifeless body in the chair behind her. How was he still writing? Was this another of the Dark Places tricks? Was she in the Dark Place? No. She’d gotten out after killing Wake, right?   
  
Yes, she must have gotten out and Logan was just away from her phone, that’s why she wasn’t answering. It was late after all. Poor reception. She walked towards the door. “Where had Casey gone?” she thought. Maybe he stepped outside whilst she was on the phone. She’d been calling long enough for someone to come back.

She opened the door to the writers room and stepped through. But she didn’t walk out onto the landing as she expected. Instead she was looking back at the writers desk. The same room she just left. This version didn’t have Wake at the desk. His body was gone. She stepped into the room and as she walked towards the desk, the TV flickered on. On it, nothing but static. Through the static Saga could hear something being said over and over again. “It’s not a loop, it’s a spiral”. Was that Wake's voice? Was he still alive? As she crept closer the voice got louder until she was a foot away from the screen. The TV switched off and she was staring right back at the reflection of herself. A flash of something, someone, sped past her. Saga spun around but nothing was there.   
  
This was getting too weird, even by the standards of the last few days. She had to get out of here. She headed towards the door again. This time opening it took her to somewhere much more familiar, somewhere she hadn’t seen in a while. The smell of jasmine hit her nose and immediately she was transported back home, to Logans room.

It was all exactly as she remembered it. The posters of her favourite bands lined the wall, the teddies she’d collected for years filled the bed. One looked out of place however. There amongst the others was a teddy she didn’t recognise. A coffee flask with the words “Oh Deer Diner”. Logan hadn’t been to the Oh Deer Diner in Bright Falls, unless they hadn’t changed the story.  
  
This story was destroying her family. Creating things that never existed, putting them in harms way. This had to stop. Saga knew that she had to get her family back. Tears filled her eyes. This had to end. 

She got up and walked towards the door. Saga took one last look back. “I’ll be with you soon Logan.” She stepped through the door. 

An impossibly long hallway lay before her. At the end of the hallway was a TV unit. She walked cautiously forward. The door behind her slammed shut and the whispers of her past breezed around her. She walked nervously forwards. Images of her life flashed up on the walls. Images of her mother, her wedding day, of Logan. As she got closer to the TV, the images began to distort. These were no longer memories she once had of her family, of her life. They were warped, twisted iterations of memories she once held close.

Yards from the TV, it switched on. On the screen was a room all too familiar to Saga. The writing room. At the desk, someone was typing furiously. It had to be Alan. He was alive. Saga leant in to see if she could find any clues. A flash of lightning on screen shook her. It lit up the figure at the desk and what was shown, wasn’t what she expected to see.  
  
Typing furiously at the desk, was not Alan. But Saga Anderson.

She was no longer the co-author of her own life. She was taking matters into her own hands, to get the ending she wanted. The ending she needed.

I’ve used the clever carrots recipe 4x. Yes four times and each starter has mold earlier and earlier. 

I cleaned the cups with water and soap and they were well rinsed and dry. Initially it starts white fuzzy then turns green as seen in photos.
Between attempts 2 and 3 I bought new flour thinking that was the issue. I used unbleached white flour. 

Attempt 1 and 2: I couldn’t find my mason jars so I used a tall glass jar with Saran Wrap placed lightly on top for first two times. First time mold on day 8, second time day 5. Both times placed in cabinet above microwave. 

Attempt 3: I used a tall glass jar with a coffee filter on top because I read that the Saran Wrap could cause humidity and mold. Moved it to the cabinet above the fridge. Mold on day 4. 

Attempt 4: I used a clean glass pasta sauce jar and left lid lightly on. Moved to pantry. Mold day 3. 

Am I doomed? Any help??

If I bought already created starter would it grow mold just as these have? I was determined to make it on my own but I’m at a loss. ",1,1762874584.0,SourdoughStarter,0,1.0,False

We grew up together enough that she is something like a cousin to me and my brother. When SNAP payments became an issue I called her to suss out if she was going to be having problems because of that and then my brother and I could send her some money.  

Turns out she does get SNAP, not very much at all, but enough for her to buy coffee, milk, etc., and keep herself going and then she can have enough money to get food for her two elderly dogs. 

She could not accept any electronic form of payment, so I wrote out the check and took it to the post office right away.

She called me last night, and I was hoping it was to tell me she’d gotten the check. In fact, she had, but I had made a mistake in her name and she told me that the check was useless to her.  It wasn’t really, but she insisted it was and tore it up. There are so many things she could have done instead, but she was angry. She berated me, complained about the envelope it was in, reiterated how useless it was, and when I said I would mail another one right away, she told me that by the time she'd get it, it would only serve for her dogs to eat somewhat better. 

Of course, I thought, I should have known better and remembered the time I’d bought her a cheap bike at Walmart, the only one I could afford, so she could get to work and she subsequently told me it was a sh#t bike. And also when she told me that some friends had bought her a washing machine but she hated it because it was too big. 

More than likely she is ashamed of having to accept charity and has not been taught the socially acceptable way of behaving in such situations, or maybe she just thinks she doesn’t need to be hypocritical, who knows. 

Last night all I could do was tell her that I was very sorry. It’s kind of scary how I automatically stopped trying to talk reason to her, simply apologized for an honest resolvable mistake, and decided to drop her, never to speak to her again.

When I told my brother about her phone call, he told me about how once he had called her and she had been so negative about everything that he had decided never to ever call her again.",1,1762874549.0,complaints,0,0.67,False

Once i got there I realized it wasn't going to be a normal bathroom trip, and ended up being on the toilet for around 20 minutes having d. Horrible lower abdominal cramps, supposed to get to class in 20 minutes, stressed that I would be late or not able to go to class at all.

I get done with my bathroom trip but I dont feel any better. I start to pack my things for class anyway, and halfway through I get the urge to use the bathroom again. Another 20 minute endeavor and I STILL dont feel any better. I'm on the toilet so long my entire right leg has fallen asleep. At this point I have about 5 minutes to get to my class that is 20 minutes away so I seceded and called out of class for the day. 

Right now I still feel awful, like I might have to go AGAIN somehow. I put a heating pad on my tummy and got a glass of water, hoping that helps. 

I'm mostly calm now but feeling guilty about missing school. This is the 2nd day in 2 weeks that's ive missed. I'm in an hour-based massage therapy program so that means my appointments for this afternoon will get canceled/rescheduled which I feel terrible about. I'm also scared of judgment from the instructors, everyone is so nice, but im scared they will start to dislike me because of absence. I'm also nervous that my boyfriend will be mad at me for staying home even though he has never been mad about something like that. But I still feel he'll be disappointed in me.

1ouc63e,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1ouc63e/a_3_year_death_marathon_finally_ended/,A 3 year death marathon finally ended.,"TL;DR I got some brain autoimmune problem (probably MCAS) triggered by a psilocybin trip, after which my life shattered into pieces and no medicine seemed to work, until I tried Ketotifen (a mast cell stabilizer with bbb penetrative quality)

The fact that I am writing this means all seems to be miraculously better by now. (This is my first time ever writing in reddit) I would love to thank reddit for if it didn't exist I wouldn't have comprehended a glimpse of what is malfunctioning within my body.

Let's get to it: years of depression from the time that I can make sense of my childhood, till 25, 2 years into therapy and I try escitalopram. So much changed that life before that seemed to had existed in a void. 4 month in, everything amazingly moving forward. I look forward to everyday, enjoying every second of the day to my bones. Until my narcissistic lust for being a better, more productive and smarter person lured me into trying psilocybin. I am hearing all these praises for psilocybin everywhere around the net and I think why not, life can be even better than this! Anyway, I tried one gram of something too potent (don't recall the name, ape or something), the trip is amazing, blindfold and everything, I confronted the monsters that had been suffocating me since childhood, the unhealthy and always lacking relationship with parents, and so on and so on. Come down was hell, took ibuprofen to sleep. For a week I stayed in bed, wanting to do nothing. 

The first thing I noticed was coffee making me angry to an unimaginable degree. I always looked forward to morning coffee as it was the few hours of the day that I felt kinda invincible and top of the world. Okay next day, coffee doing the same. Tea! No matter how light, again anger and suicidal thoughts! Hot chocolate! The worst! A tiny piece of chocolate would send me to hell. Went down theough this rabbit hole of blaming myself for fucking up a perfectly (seemingly) good life. 

Went to the same psychiatrist, explained everything, and he prescribed carbamazepine (antipsychotic). That went for a month and I felt worse. I kinda wanted to never see a doctor. Months later of no motivation at all for anything and I am in desperate need for money, I got some project and I couldn't even seat behind the fucking desk for a second. So I got a new psychiatrist who didn't have a problem to prescribe vyvanse. On it, I still didn't enjoy doing anything, but I was a machine who just works. 4 month in, I got paid. Life is okay. But I can't stay on vyvanse forever. I lost all my creativity on vyvnase and just was a machine. Coming off, everything back to the same weird and apathetic place.

This is the time I started to seriously traverse every hall in reddit. (You might say instead you should have tried other doctors, I did) the first thing that kind of brought the light back was Dxm. Dxm plus memantine was amazing, the only problem was that I kinda felt drunk through the whole day and still a sip off coffee and down to the darkest and deepest hole of existence. I was on it and felt normal but couldn't work. 

Next psychiatrist (as I was kinda trying desperately everyone of them looking for an life saving angel) said maybe let's try different ssri. Sertraline, from 25 till 200, nothing but an endless never-reaching road to sexual orgasm. Not happy, feeling numb and stupid, coffee or anything stimulating sends me to hell. Came back to 100 and then 50. 

Oh I forgot to tell you that I meanwhile I have tried every sort of supplement, from methylated vitamins to sam-e, herbals like ashw and saint John's wort and gensing, and anything I saw a person mentioned in reddit that gave them their happiness or normalness back. I tried any supplement avaliable on the market. I have bottles in a big fucking box that makes my house looking like a pharmacy. I also tried some other meds like modafinil and fluoxetine as well. There wasn't a road not traversed by my helpless desire to feel normal again. Gabapenting, pregabaline, zanax, all magnesium salts with different absorption rates and so on and so on.

Fast forward, I am depressed as hell, I got sick on top of it. Flu or something (I got covid 3 times during the peak of it back int 2020 or something). So I try an NSAID complex having ibuprofen, caffeine and acetaminophen. I feel good, or better I say ""wanting"". Wanting life and wanting to do something. There was a sparkle. Inflammation? Pain? Neurological problems that wouldn't probably be directly related to monoamine levels? Okay, I am all over them, ibuprofen, aspirin, celecoxib. They seem to make me okay, but only for a little bit of time. Still coffee is poison. 

Seeking a new psychiatrist who is open to listening instead of just starting to write prescription. Found one (expensive af) and he talked to me for an hour. She said we had a lot of cases like you since covid that response badly to any glutamatergic thing or stimulant. She said that you have long covid, I told her that I wasn't experiencing any sort of exhaustion till my mushroom experience. And she said, there it was all along, needed a spark for it to gain dominance. So after discussions she says I should try an SNRI called venlafaxin, very promising for this autoimmune sort of problem. I insisted for LDN (as I had gathered a ridiculous amount of pharma knowledge, and remembered, inflammation => reddit => LDN) she said the is no LDN in our country, only N. And also that this SNRI made people better. Three weeks in, and I feel relatively good, but coffee still the same. 

I cursed the pyschiatrist again and went on my own way (which is again investigating reddit and redditors with the same signs and symptoms as me). Funny that there wasn't a simple case of post-psilocybin depression anywhere (I am paranoid about that). Fast forward, I see MCAS people. They are kind of similar to my situation, though I only had the neurological part and a bit skin part of the problem (no GI or anything else related to signs of MCAS). One thing that I remembers during my experiences was diphenhydramine, one normal dose before coffee, and coffee doesn't torture me, but also I am drunk midday. So histamine theory, mast cells, defensive system fucking it's own body. Fucking psychiatrists (not the last one though, she turned on a llight at least) didn't even tell me that there is a kind of doctor named immunologist that work on the specific thing. All the while they tried to encircle my symptoms to normal psychiatric problems (Maybe it's my 3rd world country). 

Finally, I am with ketotifen, an H1 blocker and Mast cell stabilizer, coffee is good, strengthening and motivating. Once more I want to get out of bed in the morning. I can WANT things and pursue them. One thing to note which is very important is that, once dose mast cells in brain go crazy, they dump a huge amount of histamine and glutamate (hence the agression) and they inhibit tyrosine hydroxylase (hence no dopamine). And this can probably be described as ""angry without a single way to move forward). And also any sort of excitement, not just coffee, imagine a music that is a tiny bit moving and groovy, can trigger them in my case. 

One thing that might be informative, that everything was okay in blood panel, only ferritin and triglyceride was high a bit. C-reactive protein low.

I will probably add edits, but please send this to anyone with this kind of symptoms, you might be doing them a lifesaving.",2,1762874480.0,MCAS,4,1.0,False

this is my first post ever and I’m using my fake/throwaway profile as I do not want to be recognized.

For contest, I’m 27F and I’ve been living with flatmates since I was 19

i currently share a flat with two other girls around my age, let’s call them A and B

I’m very close with A, we have been living together for almost three years and we hit off right away

B has been staying in the house for a bit more than one year and we’ve had multiple issues with her

when B visited the house, we made it clear that we wanted somebody we could spend some time with, but she spent most of the time in her room, she would come out only to cook and sometimes when my boyfriend was over because he is very talkative and he would invite her every single time to get a coffee with us 

because of this, B got a bit closer with me rather than the other flatmate. A noticed it and she was feeling quite excluded by B’s behaviour and it took them more than a year to fix the issue

the B hasn’t been very respectful with the things we had requested: she would take more than half the space in the fridge, in the freezer and on the kitchen counter and we had to talk about it multiple times to get some improvement

also, we usually do the laundry on Sunday because the electricity is cheaper, but B would run at least three cycles and basically would keep it occupied the whole day to wash barely a laundry basket

what happened now?

when B moved in she brought her vacuum cleaner and said we could use it, she only asked to empty it after every use

one day I went to use it and i noticed that a small part was out of place, I hadn’t used it in the days prior to this and i told her right away. the issue was minimal, it was mainly aesthetic since it was still working properly 

B complained with A that I had broken it and I was not taking responsibility for doing that. Btw, A fixed it within minutes, it really wasn’t a big deal.

i decided to get my own vacuum cleaner to avoid issues like that in the future and I bought exactly the same model she had

After a while B decided she wanted to get a new one, so basically she bought it from Amazon and sent back the old one (so she spent literally no money to change it)

last week I used B’s vacuum cleaner to clean the house because I had to buy the filters for mine, after that i emptied it and put it back 

the next morning B sent a quite aggressive message in the group chat saying that a piece was missing and she wanted to know who and why the misplaced it. I later found out that she already knew that i was the one who had used it.

i told her that I had used it but I hadn’t removed any pieces but maybe it fell in the trash bin and I offered to check. in the meantime, the A had already found it and put it back

anyway, B started sending me very angry messages in the group chat, saying that I wasn’t respecting her stuff, that without that piece the vacuum cleaner would break, that she didn’t have the money to get a new one and she didn’t want me to use her stuff anymore and she would stop use mine as well

i was quite confused and I got quite annoyed because of this because she gave me no chance to say that I was sorry, she straight up attacked me and because of that I didn’t even want to talk with her to explain myself and apologize

later i talked with the A and she told me that apparently B has been mad at me for almost a month and a half because at her birthday party with her friends we were talking about changing flatmates (she was supposed to leave the house) and that she came to this house after her former flatmate accused her of stealing

her friend asked me what had she stolen from our house and I jokingly said a few item she borrowed and hadn’t returned

i don’t think she’s a thief or anything like that, but I think she has a tendency to forget to give things back/she misunderstands when something is lent and when it’s gifted. I don’t even care about most of the things since they are cheap and I know if I may need them back I just need to ask, so it wasn’t an attack in my mind but only a joke

So apparently she’s been mad at me for over a month because of this and she’s waiting for me to apologize but she never told me that the joke triggered her 

A told me that she tried to calm her down when the vacuum cleaner thing happened but she didn’t manage to do that and she thinks that B’s anger for that is a sum of things

https://preview.redd.it/060q3zuu9n0g1.png?width=1500&format=png&auto=webp&s=59d1cfd91957d4b61e320ebbbd8f75d40cf36299

The Solana Seeker is brilliant as a standalone crypto mobile device. Never before has the crypto mobile experience been *so seamless*, and *so secure*. However, the handset itself is only one piece of a far more ambitious puzzle. Disrupting the omnipotent mobile duopoly and giving power back to users is no easy task, demanding a drastic reimagining of economic incentives. 

$SKR will be the second token launched by Solana Labs, and anyone with a Seeker in their pocket is doing themselves a terrible disservice if they’re not firing off some transactions every single day.

Using the Seeker organically for all your onchain needs is *probably* the best way to boost your $SKR allocation on TGE-day. Instead of spamming meaningless transactions, ***boundless curiosity*** and a desire to try new things will ultimately help you get the most out of your Seeker experience.

We’ve been tinkering with the Solana Seeker for a few weeks now, and while it’s still not an exact science, maxxing out your activity tracker is not as hard as CT might have you believe. 

In this unofficial guide, we’ll go over everything we’re doing to get the most out of the Seeker experience, and how you can hopefully boost your $SKR.

# The Crypto Mobile Economy

Before getting into the ***how***, let’s start with the ***why***? 

It is abundantly clear that mobile devices are the world’s primary method of accessing the internet. Over [61%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/?srsltid=AfmBOop1diaG7FH5oZwq7NBU3btyjU_GzLJ6FxGB8E74GeTDk3K8zLzl) of all internet traffic is generated via mobile devices, a trend which is expected to continue in the years to come.

https://preview.redd.it/zfeje2pw9n0g1.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=466fe9c51d33522081de707242ff7abea2520ff8

Solana is, in our humble opinion, the future of blockchain. If you’re reading this Seeker airdrop guide, chances are you’re already sufficiently Solana-pilled, so we won’t waste your time explaining why it's the best-suited public blockchain for mass adoption.

Solana Seeker, with its TEEPIN architecture, Seed Vault Wallet, and feeless dApp Store, is the world’s first crypto-native mobile experience, powered by the most performant and accessible blockchain available today.

If you’re bullish on the future of mobile internet, and you’re bullish on Solana, Seeker is the ultimate culmination of the two. Solana Mobile’s governance token, $SKR, powers the [Seeker’s circular economy](https://solanafloor.com/news/emmett-hollyer-breaks-down-solana-seeker-announcements), rewarding contributors and enabling holders to govern the ecosystem.

https://preview.redd.it/28etw1wz9n0g1.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c9ab1df1fd80393f2139d8c97b190de8adba9e6

# Turn on Seeker Activity Tracking

Last thing before getting into the nuts and bolts: Make sure you’ve got your Solana Mobile Usage and Diagnostics settings switched on. These are available from within the Seed Vault Wallet. 

https://preview.redd.it/zmor6jv0an0g1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=857905cb6ce7efdd3c654e40a7f6aaac1664a5af

If you want to use a VPN to protect your privacy, rest assured that it will not affect your activity. Some apps might have certain geo-blocking restrictions that might make them unavailable in certain countries, but as long as you’ve flipped your Usage & Diagnostics tracking to ‘On’, you’re covered. 

# Onchain

The “Onchain” section activity tracker is probably the most important section to fill out every single day. Executing transfers, swaps, deposits, mints, and staking transactions on the Solana blockchain using the Seeker is the best way of boosting your activity and building consistent mobile habits. 

Fortunately, the Solana Seeker has provided us with plenty of ways to do this. The Solana dApp store includes many of Solana’s favorite DeFi apps, so you can leverage the onchain economy in all the ways you normally would. Trade perps on the Drift, lend $SOL with the Save app, swap memecoins with Vector, or earn yield on stables with Perena.

As far as growing your daily onchain footprint, swap size seems to be more important than swap frequency. I’ve noticed I have larger bubbles on my calendar on days when I make larger swaps. Again, larger, organic transactions are better than high-frequency, spammy behavior.

https://preview.redd.it/zujy0aw1an0g1.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f7bbf901063afb3c14de4a99a598048474a9de8

For minting NFTs, you have a few options. Classic sites like LaunchmyNFT, or the Magic Eden app, let you mint NFT collections like it's 2021, while Mallow gives you a pretty easy way to turn images from your camera roll into NFTs for as little as 0.015 $SOL.

https://preview.redd.it/eks8kmd3an0g1.png?width=1587&format=png&auto=webp&s=68db4f9379e54d92c1ede544e52ccb3315680da4

Solana’s favorite Store of Value, Ore, has just had its app listed in the dApp Store. Mining Ore is undoubtedly one of the easiest ways to rack up transactions organically, and is a lot more fun than washing meaningless swaps or transferring between your own wallets.

Finally, and most importantly, make sure you're using Seeker’s native wallet when connecting to dApps, and stake $SOL to the Seeker Validator. I know it’s tempting to use old favorites like Phantom and Solflare, but the Seed Vault Wallet (Designed by Solflare, btw) lets you live the Seeker experience as it was intended. 

While I don’t think you’d be *punished* for using other wallets, I wouldn’t be surprised if there were some kind of activity multiplier behind the scenes for Seed Vault Wallet users.

Top tips:

* Minimum 5-10 organic transactions per day - don’t wash trade for the sake of wash trading. Mining $ORE is the alpha.
* Stake natively to the Seeker Validator
* Diversify your transactions - make sure you're swapping, sending, depositing, and minting.

# Daily Use

Filling up the Daily Use bar is pretty simple. If you’re hitting your minimum 5-10 organic transactions every day, your Daily Use section will take care of itself.

Tapping the info icon in this section tells us that tracking Daily Use refers to “how Seeker fits into your rhythm”. I might be taking this too literally, but I’m also trying to use Seeker for ‘real life’ stuff as much as possible, just in case. This might be overkill, but for me, that means using maps, calls, mobile data, and taking pictures with the camera.

If you don’t want to transfer over your existing SIM card, buy yourself an eSIM through the encryptSIM app in the dApp Store.

# dApps

While maxxing out your Onchain Activity and Daily Use are simple and straightforward, maintaining good scores in the “dApps” section is like Seeker’s final boss. Getting a green tick in each category every week is no small feat, and there’s not really any way to game the system other than being genuinely curious.

https://preview.redd.it/ktd4b5m4an0g1.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=47e02c714d4a9917ab405ba1474a3afd423cde8b

# New Things

As the name suggests, the best way to tick off doing “New Things” is by, well, doing new things. New apps are hitting the Solana dApp Store pretty much every day, so make sure to check back every day to see if some new game or app has been listed. Otherwise, keep notifications on for the Solana Mobile 𝕏 account so you don’t miss any new apps.

One of the things that has consistently helped us hit green ticks in this category is to spend time using every Featured app. Whenever you see something new in the ‘Featured App’ carousel, download it and spend as much time as you can familiarizing yourself with how it works. 

https://preview.redd.it/n7rzy096an0g1.png?width=1822&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae3f2a4e1985006ad740fd88a224f2b2d43b44e9

After downloading Photo Finish, tapping through the app and registering my horse in its first race (it didn’t win, obviously), I came back to the activity tracker and was happy to see that elusive green tick. Photo Finish is also running a matched deposit promo for Seeker users, so make sure you deposit $50 to get up to 4000 DERBY and a free horse.

# In the Store

As you’d expect, this section measures how you interact with the Solana dApp Store. If you think you can easily game this section by opening the dApp Store and arbitrarily tapping around every day, guess again.

From what I can gather, the best way to consistently fill out this section is to steadily download and explore apps from a variety of different categories every day. While it’s tempting to install every interesting app the first time you open the store, it might pay to be patient.

Every day, download and explore 3 apps from different categories - and don’t cut corners on the ***exploring*** aspect. If you download a trading app, you need to place some trades. If you download, spend some time actually playing and gaining levels. If there’s an onchain element, even better, that’ll help boost your activity in other areas. 

Also, don't be afraid to give back. Contribute to the dApp Store by writing quality reviews about the dApps you test and report bugs where necessary.

# dApp Usage

Again, self-explanatory. Max out your ‘dApp Usage’ tracking by ***using dApps***. Over time, you’ll come to create your own list of apps you find helpful, meaningful, and genuinely enjoy. 

It’s still uncertain exactly how long you need to spend using dApps to fill the meter, so just try to spend as much time as you can with your favorites.

# The Daily Routine

The easiest way to get the most out of your Seeker and max out that activity tracker is to form daily, organic habits. Again, don’t waste your time spamming swaps between $USDC and $USDT or sending yourself 0.0001 $SOL. There’s more than enough genuine actions you can take every day to fill out your tracker without resorting to brainless, wasteful behavior.

Here’s what I’m doing every day:

* Native stake to the Seeker validator - it’s passive, and it counts as ongoing onchain activity.
* Scalp/swing trade $SOL-USD within the Seed Vault Wallet - NFA, but teach yourself how to buy high and sell low by trading $SOL every day.
* Use your favorite apps with onchain actions - Mine $ORE, join Moonwalk games, and contribute to DePIN projects.
* Check the Solana dApp store for new featured apps, and commit quality time to learning how they work.
* Download and use 2-3 new apps every day.
* Check [SolanaFloor’s Seeker Hub](https://solanafloor.com/seeker) and take advantage of any new exclusive perks.
* Use Seeker for ‘normal’ things - take pictures, use maps, and get in mid-curve arguments on 𝕏.

If it sounds like it’s a lot of work, that’s because it is. The $SKR airdrop could end up being one of the biggest in Solana history, so it makes sense that Solana Mobile isn’t going to give you a handout just for sending $1 to yourself every morning over coffee.

Think not what Seeker can do for you, but what ***you can do for Seeker***. Everyone wants the juicy airdrop, but there’s little doubt in my mind that the people who end up with the best allocations are those who contribute to the Seeker experience. If you’re a developer, join a Seeker Hackathon and become a part of one of crypto’s most ambitious experiments of all time.

Instead of trying to game the system and extract as much as you can with minimal effort, let your curiosity run wild and explore everything the Seeker has to offer. Seek, and you will find.

Background - Suffered extremely since the covid days of 2020. I believe my trigger was stress, imagine being a small business owner and wedding musician during covid. 

Symptoms - Fatigue, vision issues, stiffness around face, tension headaches, and general brain fog. I used to tell my Doctors it was like I felt I was just watching myself go through the motions, never felt present. 

Endless Doctor visits for 4 years with no solution and everything looking healthy. I'd go through periods of trying a new medication or trying something out myself and nothing would change so then I'd go back to the doctor once I got pissed enough to try again. 

  
In early 2024 I saw an eye Dr who said every time someone comes to him complaining of vision issues with healthy eyes 90% of the time its a sleep disorder.   

Book a sleep test and finally after 4 years of BS I'm diagnosed with mild OSA. 

I barely failed the test but failed regardless so this was a win for me. 

  
Get on a CPAP and see significant changes. At this point I'm 70% back to normal which is pretty huge when you believe your are operating at 20%.

About a year goes by I'm adjusted to sleeping with a CPAP most days are good, sometimes I have a terrible day with fog but most are decent.

I start the process over again trying to figure out how to get even closer to 100% this time just on my own. 

  
Without dragging this out even more I found caffeine was a huge trigger. Basically I woke up had a very clear day and coincidentally skipped my morning coffee (id drink at least 2 cups in the morning for years). Later in the day was feeling meh so stopped by starbucks got a latte and boom an hour later the fog hit like a truck. Switched to decaf haven't looked back. That got me to 85%. 

  
At this point I'm doing great; most days are clear enough that I would say it does not hinder me. My mind is sharp again and I can focus. Two symptomed remained tho and that was my vision just feeling slight off and tension headaches. Of course there still would be the occasional day were the fog would return, not as thick as before but still enough to know I wasnt 100%. 

Since now I was just focused on my vision I bought new glasses thinking they were just old and these came with a couple clip ons for Bluelight and sunglasses. 

Took a few months to get to this conclusion but I said screw it maybe my eyes are just toast from being on a computer all day for work, and the fact that my favorite thing to do at night is play video games on my home computer. So been wearing this bigass yellow clip on over my regular glasses and amazingly enough a few days after doing it my face feels less stiff and my eyes in general are improving. So I just feel like this is the last piece of this shitty puzzle im been piecing together for 5 years now and that's why I wanted to write this post. 

  
All the things that caused it were things I had been doing for decades that all sort of contributed to my fog in one way or the other. Hope this helps a few of you even just a little bit.  

  
TL:DR -

Things that improved my life ---- 

Get a sleep test and actually track your sleep (When I got my CPAP it told me to my surprise I was sleeping only like 5 hours a night on average.)

Stop drinking caffeine

Get ugly yellow glasses if your life revolves around being on a computer.  

Things that did not help ----

Any sort of medication - Topamax - Sertraline/Zoloft ( I think I would fight my first Dr who put me on that crap if I ever saw him again )

Things that may of helped ---- 

B12 - Magnesium - occasional exercise - Trying to eat healthier.

Like, ADHD and honestly it’s really annoying. When he wants something he NEEDS IT. Especially, breakfast and coffee first thing in the morning. Doesn’t matter if we were up until 3am the night before eating something. It’s like he’s this bottomless pit for coffee and food. He’s thin and in shape but for me in the morning I can go a few hours before food. I prefer to wake up easy on vacation and maybe ease into sex organically. He has said multiple times during arguments that I never initiate sex but to be truthful, it’s hard to want to when I know it’s going to be sex and then some comment like “ah that was great. Now time to go see a man about a wallaby (Take a poop) and go grab coffee and food!” Like, wtf? Can’t we just cuddle for a minute? Can’t you just soak it in? For context, the morning after we got married we had a really nice ocean view hotel, and he woke up, threw the blinds open and was ready to get after the day. We were in our hometown and see this ocean everyday. In my mind I was so confused. I was thinking we would wake up, fool around, maybe order room service and then proceed with the day. Now, we are on our honeymoon and we were waiting for to see if our shore excursion got cancelled so I suggested we get back in bed and verbally made hints the we could get frisky. He seemed unenthusiastic but got back in bed. Kept complaining about coffee and food. So we got up, (no sex) and no I didn’t start even trying to make out with him because honestly what’s the point when he’s just going to get up and leave right after for coffee within 5 minutes. So, we got up, I started to get ready and he was sooooo antsy for food and coffee. We just started fighting and I said something like “wtf. Can’t you just wait? Like, don’t you want to enjoy the morning with me, maybe have some sex and then go on with the day?” He replied “you only said you wanted to have sex you never made any move.” The whole situation is like a constant turn off for me. It doesn’t make me want to initiate anything. Then we fought and he went to go…you guessed it… grab coffee and food solo. And, it’s our honeymoon so I really feel shitty about this. I may end up just doing my own thing today I’m so annoyed but the sex issues is really starting to bother me. Especially him saying I never initiate. What’s the best way to initiate when you don’t have that raw spark because you’re turned off by what your partner is going to do immediately after sex?

1oubznl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SameGrassButGreener/comments/1oubznl/la_or_bay_area_and_where_specifically/,LA or Bay Area (and where specifically)?,"Late 30s F, ready to mix it up and finally say goodbye to the east coast. 

I have a job offer with a company which has offices in the greater LA metro as well as the Bay Area, and I can choose which one I want to be based out of.

I only need to go into the office ~once a month, so I’m not indicating where the office is specifically. The in-office time is so infrequent I don’t mind whatever inconvenience is caused by it - would rather just focus on where I want to live. 

I’d like to rent a 1BR for under ~3500 a month,  not sure if this is a realistic ask but I’ll be making ~$210-240k depending on bonus, and would like to stay within my budget.

Strongly prefer a townhome or small bungalow setup as I really don’t want to hear neighbors through walls and mega- apartment style living doesn’t appeal to me. If I had to do an apartment, I could handle style of the older/converted apartments where it’s a 2 story building and each unit exits directly to the outside (I have a dog so not keen on the long inside hallways). 

Safety is the most important thing to me, I don’t mind driving to socialize if it means I can reside somewhere peaceful and surrounded by trees/green space and quiet. 

Social aspect is the second most important factor. Ideally a part of the metro area that has other singles in their 30s/40s, where it’s not all families and not all fresh-outta-college people. A mix is nice. I would like to be able to date and understand that because of traffic many guys aren’t interested in dating beyond their convenience radius.

Outside of work, I enjoy golf and nature photography, just taking random walks through new parts of town, museums, any kind of cultural event. I appreciate a nice cocktail but not at all into nightlife culture. I don’t expect being able to golf much once I move given the relative scarcity and extreme costs of golf in CA (cue the tiny violins, I know).

Also, I know this is a first world problem, but I’d like to be able to live somewhere I can go to target or Walmart and buy whatever I need without needing to wait for someone to come unlock it from a case. In my visits to the Bay Area it seems like everything is locked up and it’s annoying to wait for amazon to ship or wait for the bougie hipster store with overpriced products to open. 

Bonus points if I can walk to a coffee shop or some basic amenities, but I don’t need any sort of dense urban walkability. 

TLDR- what neighborhood within an hour of the Bay Area or LA metro would you recommend to an outgoing and social primarily  remote worker in their late 30s who wants to live in a safe, peaceful setting?

**1) Care Ops binder + cloud**  
Tabs: IDs/insurance, meds, diagnoses/tests, appointments, care plans, benefits, contacts.  
Mirrored in Google Drive so family can help. (Privacy: share “view only” where needed.)

**2) Weekly cadence (keep it light but consistent)**

* **Mon:** call/recall clinics, check referrals + waitlists
* **Wed:** meds check/renewals
* **Fri:** paperwork + file notes, make duʿāʾ for ease and shifāʾ

**3) 1-page brief (“Mom at a glance”)**  
Conditions + baseline, red flags, current meds/doses, allergies, top 3 concerns this month. Hand it to new providers.

**4) Enter appointments with a niyyah + an agenda**  
I bring 3 questions max, take notes, and ask:

* “What should I watch for?”
* “What is the exact next step, who owns it, and by when?”
* “Can you put the plan in the visit notes so I can follow it?”

**5) Document everything**  
Dates/times, names, ticket/referral numbers, promised timelines. Snap pics of forms/lab reqs. 

**6) Track symptoms like a scientist**  
Simple log: date, symptom, severity (1–10), triggers, what helped. Beats “it’s worse lately” and gets action.

**7) Advocate with respectful scripts (adab + clarity)**

* “We’re worried about X. Given her age/condition, what’s the safest next step today?”
* “Could you write the plan in the after-visit summary?”
* “If this worsens after hours, who do we call?”

**8) Build the roster & escalation path**  
One sheet: names, roles, direct lines, after-hours numbers, and steps (front desk → nurse → clinic lead → patient relations).

**9) Re-ask about supports—regularly**  
Home care, respite, rehab, allied health, community programs, faith-based supports. Even if they say “waitlist,” I check monthly. Be persistent and ask Allah to open the doors for you. 

**10) Guard your bandwidth (amānah to yourself)**  
Time-block care tasks, set boundaries: “I can do meds and appointments; I can’t do overnights.” Delegate when possible.

**11) Prepare for “what if”**  
Hospital go-bag, printed med list, powers of attorney/consents accessible.

A bit of background: My MIL has been in therapy *with my husband* since March (about 8 months now) because her manipulative behavior has caused a lot of problems in our marriage and with our kids. Over the last 4 years, we’ve had to slowly reduce contact — from almost daily, to once a month — and finally in March my husband gave her an ultimatum: start therapy with him or we’re cutting contact.

We also decided on a 6-month no contact period with the kids while she was in therapy. She seemed to be making some progress for a while. In August, after my husband encouraged her to work on things with me, she reached out to plan lunch. During that lunch, she gave a blanket apology for how her behavior had affected our marriage and family… and immediately followed it up with, *“I miss my grandbabies.”* Not exactly heartfelt, but it was at least *something*.

Then, at the end of August my SIL came to my son’s birthday party and completely blew up at my husband, accusing him of being too hard on their mom and for holding her past against her, and even threatening to “tell our kids the truth.” After that, SIL cut contact with us — and we haven’t heard from her since.

I told my husband that MIL was likely behind SIL’s outburst and suggested extending the no-contact period with the kids a little longer. He got upset and refused. So, when the six months officially ended in September, we reintroduced the kids to MIL.

The visit didn’t go terribly, but there were red flags:

* As soon as she got out of the car, she asked the kids for hugs. They froze up (they hadn’t seen her in six months), and she said, *“I’m Grandma, do you remember me?”* — which made things really awkward. In the past she has used comments to make the kids feel guilty for not giving her physical affection, so physical affection is a big trigger for us.
* Later she asked us *in front of the kids* if she could ask what they wanted for Christmas. My husband and her therapist have told her repeatedly that she shouldn’t use gifts to buy affection or bring up gift-giving in front of the kids.
* There were a couple of other small comments she made but we didn't want to overwhelm her with negative feedback.

My husband these issues in therapy, and when he did, she broke down crying and said she “can’t do anything right.” The whole session turned into soothing her, and he came out feeling like she had a “breakthrough moment.” Meanwhile, I’m thinking — after *six months* of therapy, this is still where we are?

The next visit won’t be until January, mostly to avoid holiday drama.

Here’s where I need advice:  
MIL has been doing therapy with my husband for eight months now, but she’s only reached out to *me* once — that lunch back in mid August. Then I saw her again during the visit with the kids in late September. Last week she texted me out of nowhere with a generic, “How are you?” I responded and tried to keep the conversation going, but it was very one-sided. Out of nowhere she texted, *“Have a great day, love you!”* which ended the conversation after only five or six texts and it felt performative — like she was checking a box to prove our relationship is fine.

So I texted back that the conversation felt surface-level and that I thought we should have a deeper talk about the visit with the kids. She immediately replied, *“Tell me when and where and I’ll be there.”*

Now we’re meeting for coffee this week — just her and me — and I’m terrified.

I want her to take *real accountability* for how she’s hurt our family, not just throw out another blanket apology and make it about seeing the kids again. But I’m also awful at confrontation and still working on being more assertive. It honestly feels like she pushed for an in-person meeting because she knows I struggle to be direct face-to-face.

I guess my questions are:

* How do I approach this conversation so she doesn’t immediately get defensive or play the victim?
* How do I hold her accountable without it turning into another situation where I’m soothing her feelings?
* And… what should I realistically *expect* from this meeting?

It kind of feels like a lose-lose situation, but pretending everything is fine isn’t an option anymore.",21,1762873925.0,JUSTNOMIL,24,0.92,False

I’ve been doing pourover for years, but got heavily into it about 2 and a half years ago, and bought a V60, Ode Gen 1, and a 1Zpresso X-Pro. Then about a year ago I added a J-Ultra when they went on sale. Recently upgraded to Gen 2 burrs in the Ode and they’re not broken in yet; still having to grind pretty coarse, as they seem to be making a lot of fines. But I primarily use that as my batch brew grinder. 

Then, for Christmas 2 years ago, the wife got me a Flair 58, and, lately, I’ve been really branching out from the standard 2:1, 25 second shots, and getting a lot more into modern, turbo-style espresso, DC Soup, basically, quick, really juicy shots. 

The kind of coffee I prefer is light roast, African beans (Eth, Tanzanian, Ugandan, Kenyan, etc) are probably my favorite. I don’t really buy super high-end beans, usually spending around $20-25 for a 10 Oz bag of specialty beans. 

I do make coffee I really like with the grinders I have, but recently I’ve discovered I really like clarity and flavor separation in espresso and filter coffee. Last week I had an espresso shot at a local coffee shop here in nashville, Sump, which Lance has actually mentioned in one of his videos (he said he had the best espresso shot of his life up until that point there). It was a natural process Costa Rican, and I was just blown away by the clarity and flavor separation. I’m not sure what grinder they used, but I’m assuming it probably had big flat burrs. I did see an EK43 sitting there, but honestly I didn’t pay attention to whether that was what they used. 

The flavor separation and clarity in that shot was such that I could clearly taste separate layers of fruit juice, chocolate, and flavors I can’t even describe. 

And I’ve had similar shots at other local shops as well. 

Anyway, I would like to buy a new grinder, and I’m just wondering if anyone else who also does basically half and half pourover and espresso and is also chasing high clarity and flavor separation has found the ideal grinder setup for this. 

I’m really eyeing the Pietro. But it has 2 available burr sets - the B-modal (multipurpose, for both espresso and filter coffee) and the M-modal (pro-brew burrs for filter). Since I do both pourover and espresso on the weekends, I don’t think I’m going to want to swap out burrs that often. 

A typical weekend day would usually be waking up and pulling a few shots for the wife and myself, then making a pourover or 2 for us, then, again in the afternoon. 

(We just do batch brew with OK grocery store beans on our Behmor or MoccaMaster on weekdays.) 

The Femobook A4Z has also really caught my attention for filter coffee as well. I’ve read some absolutely glowing reviews on that grinder over on r/pourover. But it’s really filter only, though I understand it can probably do turbo-style spro. 

Honestly, I’m thinking about buying a Pietro with both available burr sets, and an A4Z! This would probably be my end-game set of grinders TBH. ",3,1762873886.0,LanceHedrick,11,1.0,False
1oubwox,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyencounters/comments/1oubwox/elderly_male_neighbor_starting_to_creep_me_out/,Elderly Male Neighbor starting to creep me out.,"I bought my house in 2021 and the guy across the street happened to be someone I worked with before he retired so it was kind of nice to have someone I knew at first after being new to the neighborhood. However, it has mostly just drove me nuts most of the time and I feel like it has gotten progressively creepier. 

At first he was kind and sent me a card. Well one time he caught me outside and pretty much wouldn’t take no for an answer for me to see HIS house. Which I found weird as I am the new homeowner? Anyways he had retired because his wife became very ill and needed care. So he forced me to tour his house and say hi to his wife which I did and then he told me “don’t be rude have a seat and visit”. Which was very uncomfortable for me as his wife wasn’t all there and I didn’t know her to begin with. 

Anytime I would be outside attempting to do anything he would come tap me on the shoulder and scare me and even though I had my hat on and earphones because I did not want to talk and he would go on and on about himself. 

That winter he took care of my sidewalks without me asking which was a nice gesture. He would drop off food homemade, ice cream from local shop, drinks from coffee place, etc. 

However there was a brief period he didn’t talk to me due to me turning in a coworker of mine for sexual harassment whom he was close with due to former law enforcement work. I would try to give a hi here and there and he would ignore me as I didn’t want any bad blood between us. 

I made peace with it and figured he would leave me alone which was kind of a win for me because I like my privacy and I’m introverted. 

Until one day I had a package delivered and he called me, I didn’t answer and he went over to look to see if it was HIS package and left it laying on the public sidewalk. He avidly watches my porch and bothers me about my packages saying people stole them when I have a doorbell cam and don’t need him staring at my porch all day. 

I’ve been working on finally getting the outside of my house a face lift for when I eventually sell and he runs over and bothers me and yaps on and on. 

Fast forward a little bit his wife passed away. He keeps trying to invite me into his home for dinner and I say no thanks. I’ve declined about 12 times. If I’m outside he tries to ask me so I have to look outside to even see if I can take my garbage out in peace. I have no interest in being alone in a house with a (72M) as I’m (29F). He is relentlessly asking me and I have started ignoring his texts because I’m tired of saying No. One of the last texts he texted me as soon as I left my house and said hey when you’re done with whatever you’re doing come over for supper. Like I feel he’s staring at my house all day long. Sure he might be lonely because his wife passed but I am a very introverted person and don’t want to be bothered by this man but also find it highly inappropriate and draining. 

I have to RUN to put my garbage can out every week. I feel I can’t get any yard work done without him bothering me. I’m going to put privacy screens on my front porch so you can’t see shadows through the curtains of my big front living room window. I’ve just had enough. 

My gut is saying something is weird and wrong.

# Full Review:

*Brigands and Breadknives* is one of the books I’ve been most looking forward to this year. After reading it, I can honestly say it both subverted and *exceeded* my expectations.

The second book in the *Legends and Lattes-*verse follows Fern, the rattkin bookseller we met in *Bookshops and Bonedust.* She’s left her home and life and shop behind to set up a bookstore next door to Viv and Tandri. Though she’s afraid of starting over, she’s willing to take a gamble on her friendship with our favorite orc coffee shop owner.

The launch of her new bookstore is a rousing success—only Fern finds herself not just feeling hollow, but actively wanting to *flee.* Never mind she has always been a bookseller and knows nothing else; she just needs to get away. Which leads her to crawling into the back of the cart belonging to renowned elven adventurer Asteryx One-Ear, the Oathmaiden, and falling asleep. When she wakes up, she’s too far from home to walk back, so she resolves to continue on the adventure until she can safely book passage home.

But as we quickly come to see, more than one adventure awaits. Asteryx is a bounty hunter, transporting her prisoner—a truly chaotic goblin named Zyll—across the continent to be delivered to justice. Zyll is more than just a handful; she keeps escaping her bonds, only to return with new friends (a monstrous chicken demon), new weapons (a talking Elder blade turned into a breadknife), and new enemies (the titular brigands). Asteryx and Fern keep doggedly moving onward, trying to corral the indefatigable Zyll, facing new challenges in the form of drawn blades, loaded crossbows, and existential crises.

Where *Legends and Lattes* and *Bookshops and Bonedust* used specific locations and settings to tell a smaller, more internal-focused story, *Brigands and Breadknives* takes us across this D&D-flavored world to slowly peel back the layers on Fern and Asteryx, to help them—and us—find the truth of who they are beneath the facades they show the world and the lies they tell themselves.

Though it’s an adventure, it still retains that cozy flavor and gives us those deep conversations in stuffy inn rooms, under the stars, or across a roaring campfire that delve into the characters’ true wants, needs, desires, and hopes. Through their journey, we come to understand a bit more about them—and through them, ourselves.

Because at its core, *Brigands and Breadknives* is a story about finding what we want to be and do, not living up to expectations placed upon us by others (even those with all the best intentions). It’s about making choices toward happiness rather than simply continuing on a road that seems clear, especially one that seems otherwise so successful.

As I write this, I can’t help wondering if this is reflective of the author’s story. Where Fern is a successful bookseller, he’s a successful audiobook narrator who has no *need* to walk down another road (the path of writing). And yet, by reading this story—and all his others—it’s clear to me that walking *this* path is a truth fundamental to who he is at his core.

All that to say, *Brigands and Breadknives* is a story as deep and true and insightful as any I’ve read, and one that absolutely had me engaged from start to finish. It’s earned its place on my Top 10 of the year and cemented Travis Baldree as an auto-buy author. For a cozy, heartwarming, and truly thoughtful read, I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  ",2,1762873820.0,Fantasy,1,0.6,False

On the terrace of the sourdough bakery **Pollen**, a young woman wearing a Burberry scarf pours water from a carafe into a coffee cup. She places it on the ground for her small dog, which is wearing a red knitted sweater. The dog begins to lap it up.



Pollen is located in the *Marina* of **New Islington**, a neighbourhood in Manchester, in northern England. The terrace overlooks a canal lined with gleaming houseboats and surrounded by grey, newly built apartment blocks. In the distance, the Victorian-industrial buildings that characterise the former working-class city of Manchester are visible: old factories and red-brick warehouses. Next to the bakery, and around New Islington Marina, there’s also a cocktail bar, a natural-wine bar and a café that doubles as a running shop.



Many people in their twenties and thirties walk through the Marina with small dogs and AirPods. The number of runners is striking too. Others wear baggy trousers, puffer jackets and sneakers.



New Islington has been gentrified, just like the rest of the **Ancoats** district in which it sits. Content creator **Xena (25)** thinks that’s fantastic. Wearing a brown suede jacket and a tote bag, she’s standing in a small park with a friend, filming a video of herself for social media. She doesn’t want her surname printed in the paper — she’s a “private person.” (Her surname is known to the editors.) She and her husband moved to Ancoats three years ago. “There’s just such a vibe for our age group. That wine bar across the street — gorgeous!”



Xena describes the new residents of the neighbourhood as “young working professionals.” Long-time locals complain that the newcomers don’t integrate well — that they don’t make contact. Xena doesn’t understand that at all. “When I’d just moved here, I opened the door of my flat, saw my neighbour, and had a ten-minute conversation with her. We had so much in common — like that we’re both content creators.”





**Ancoats**, at the start of this century still a breeding ground for crime and run-down social housing, shows how well things are going for Manchester. It’s going so well, in fact, that people have started talking about the *“Londonification of Manchester.”* Prosperity has risen sharply. The GDP per capita in **Greater Manchester**, the metropolitan area in which the city lies, grew by almost **29 percent between 2004 and 2023** (inflation-adjusted), according to the Office for National Statistics. Across England as a whole, the increase was just over **15 percent**. Greater Manchester now has more than **three million** residents; the city of Manchester itself, over **half a million**.



Housing prices have risen dramatically too. Data analysis by *The Daily Telegraph* shows that **eight of the ten** areas in England and Wales with the fastest-growing house prices are in Greater Manchester. In one Salford neighbourhood, the average price **tripled since 2014** — from **£92,000 to £270,000 (€310,000)**.



That’s a huge shift for a city that a few decades ago hardly anyone wanted to live in. In the nineteenth century, northern England was the cradle of the **Industrial Revolution**; Manchester was known for its cotton mills. But over the twentieth century the northern industries collapsed as production moved to countries with cheaper labour. That led to mass unemployment, poverty and social unrest. Although the region began to recover somewhat in the 1990s, the gap between the north and the wealthy south — especially London — remains large.





While much of northern England still lags behind, **Manchester has become London’s “cool little brother.”** That’s thanks to both its flourishing economy and its decades-old cultural reputation. The city has a large alternative scene and a rich musical heritage — with bands like **Oasis, The Smiths, Joy Division** and **The Stone Roses**. The no-nonsense mentality of **Mancunians** gives the city its character. And Manchester is home to two of the most famous football clubs in the world: **Manchester United** and **Manchester City**.



From a gloomy industrial city, Manchester has evolved into a *second London.* According to **Richard Leese**, the foundation for that transformation was laid back in the 1980s. Speaking via video call, Leese recalls how bleak the city centre looked back then. “Outside office hours it was completely deserted. Apart from Chinatown there were only two or three restaurants.”



When Labour once again lost the national election in the late 1980s and the Tories announced new austerity measures that slashed local-authority budgets, Manchester — a staunch Labour city — realised it would have to pull itself up. The council decided to take a pragmatic approach: to cooperate closely with the Conservative government and with private business to stimulate growth. “It was the only way left to tackle our social problems,” Leese says.



Manchester invested its limited funds strategically. The goal was to build the infrastructure of a modern city to attract investors — expanding public transport, creating a new concert hall, and filling funding gaps in housing developments through *gap-funding* partnerships. The council also encouraged **sport and culture** as economic drivers and relaxed nightlife licensing rules to foster a livelier scene. With its three universities (Manchester Metropolitan and the two that merged in 2004 into the University of Manchester), the city also pushed for “a stronger presence and more advanced research,” Leese says.





**Rachel Stansfield (22)**, standing with her friend Xena in New Islington park, thinks even more people would move to Manchester if there were a greater variety of jobs. With a nose piercing and leopard-print trousers, she says: “Right now, a lot of people come to Manchester because they can’t afford London. Manchester isn’t London — but it’s definitely the closest thing to it.”



The city government sees it the same way. It aims to keep expanding employment and diversify its economy. “In the industrial era, a city’s location mattered — being near coal or iron,” explains economic adviser **Alan Harding** on a café terrace downtown. Dressed head-to-toe in black — suit, shirt, shoes — he embodies the Mancunian fashion palette. “Nowadays, people and skills are far more important for where companies choose to locate.”



The idea, says Harding (chief economic adviser for Greater Manchester from 2016 to 2021), is to create a city where **high-skilled people want to live**, and those people, in turn, attract a variety of businesses. Manchester now has a **diverse economy**: major sectors include finance and business services, life sciences, and digital technology, alongside strong **creative and media industries** — the BBC moved much of its operations to **Salford** in 2011.



According to **Mike Emmerich**, who was Greater Manchester’s chief economist from 2006 to 2015, the **2002 Commonwealth Games** marked a key turning point. “They brought huge investment in infrastructure and sports facilities — Manchester City’s stadium was built for them. But the most important effect was psychological: Manchester remembered it was *not just any city*. It regained its confidence.”



Emmerich helped produce the **Manchester Independent Economic Review (MIER)** in 2009, analysing why Greater Manchester’s economy had been slow to grow. That research helped the city strike a deal with central government granting it new powers normally reserved for Westminster. The **Greater Manchester Devolution Deal (2014)** gave the region more control over health, transport, housing and planning — a major step in a country as centralised as the UK.





Yet not everyone shares in Manchester’s boom. Critics point to pockets of **deep poverty** across Greater Manchester. Long-time residents of the gentrified neighbourhoods often feel pushed out or alienated.



In the few streets of small social-housing terraces behind **New Islington Marina**, **British flags** hang from lampposts — part of a wider flag-waving protest associated with anti-immigration sentiment. Looking up, you see the area surrounded by cranes and rising apartment blocks.



**Norman (66)**, a retired resident whose surname is known to the editors, gestures from his front garden toward one of the cranes. “I’ve lived here all my life. Now they’re building new houses, but we can’t afford them. And ours have never been properly renovated.” His garden has artificial grass, and a British flag flutters above it. His wife sits under a fleece blanket in a garden chair, talking on the phone and puffing on a large brown vape.



He has no time for the newcomers. “They don’t integrate, don’t even say hello on the street.” He never visits the Marina, just a few minutes’ walk away. “I’m not really a *Cotswoldy* person, you know?” (The Cotswolds is a wealthy region in southwest England.)



A few streets away, **Tracy Donnelly (62)**, out walking her dog, feels the opposite. “I’m dead happy with it! My house is worth twice as much now!” She points to the rented houses across the road. “I used to live there — now I’ve bought one a bit further on.” And what does she think of the new residents? “Well, I don’t give a fuck! It’s still our neighbourhood, isn’t it? And they don’t bother me.”",16,1762873816.0,manchester,0,0.94,False

I've completed 7 days on Carnivore.  Starting week 2 today. I just wanted to share some of the changes.    
First, my weight has dropped 10 pounds.  I started at 260.1 and today i stepped on the scale at 250.  That's great of course, but some other things i'm noticing may be even more impressive.   
Inflamation in my body, basically gone. I have severe arthritis in my hip (went to a dr and he couldn't beleive a 37 year old almost already needed a hip replacement) and the pain from that is almost completely gone.  My psoas muscle (hip flexor) has also been severely inflamed to the point of waking me up through the night from throbbing.  That pain is completely gone.  I sleep better, and not only do i sleep better but I am better rested in less time.  If i sleep 5 hours i'm still up and ready to go and not groggy or tired at all.  

My general mood is substantially better.  I avoid bickering just to bicker and i find things make me less angry.  Like if you catch your pocket on a drawer knob instead of it making me so mad, i just laugh it off.  Little things dont' bother me as much.

Food tastes better.  I know i'm still very early on so i'm sure i'm not completely detoxed and not sugar reliant, but food tastes significantly better.  Black coffee tastes incredible to me now, and that's something i'd NEVER drink before.  Not only does food taste better, but I eat until i'm full.  I've not counted 1 single calorie on this diet.  And taking the stress of calorie counting out of hte equation has made this insanely sustainable for me!  

My cravings are gone.  I went to a kabab restaurant in Moorseville NC and I used my fingers to pick the meat off the bed of rice not even tempted to eat it.  And didn't even eat any of the pita bread they brought out to our table because i didn't want it. No dessert cravings at all.  No bread cravings at all.  Starting around day 4 I noticed that anything put in front of me that was carby and sugary, i could feel the way my body felt before starting this and i think to myself ""nah, it's not worth that"". 

  
I tried this diet before but i just couldn't stick with it.  No clue why because i feel better than i've felt in decades now!",8,1762873642.0,carnivorediet,3,1.0,False

Things get busy during the holiday season and we see broken garbage disposals a lot due to putting the wrong things down the sink. 

🚫 **Foods that can wreck your garbage disposal...**

We try and avoid putting anything too hard or that will cause build up. 

* Turkey bones & skin – Bones can break the blades, and greasy skin clogs pipes.
* Potato peels – They turn into a gluey paste that sticks to your drain.
* Grease & oils – They cool, harden, and create nasty clogs.
* Celery & stringy veggies – Fibers wrap around the blades and jam them.
* Rice, pasta, bread – These expand with water and block the drain.
* Eggshells – The membrane can stick to parts, and the shell dulls blades.
* Coffee grounds – They settle and form sludge that’s hard to rinse out.
* Fruit pits & seeds – Too hard for the blades and can jam the motor.

**Keep things flowing...**

* Run cold water while using the disposal.
* Use a sink strainer to catch scraps and prevent accidents.
* Feed waste gradually—don’t dump everything in at once.
* Freshen it up post-dinner with ice cubes + lemon slices.

If your disposal is making weird noises, draining slowly, or just won’t turn on, it could be a deeper issue in your drain line. We don't recommend DIYing this, and it's better to call the pros. What are your garbage disposal fails? ",1,1762873451.0,u_AceHomeServices,0,1.0,False

I know what I did was wrong but it felt like something I needed, you know? Like I was drowning in mom life and work and he made me feel young again.

Anyway, last Friday night I was supposed to be at a late shift. I wasn't. I was with him at his apartment. My husband texted me around 11pm asking when I'd be home and I said midnight. But I lost track of time and at 1:30am my phone started blowing up. Missed calls, texts asking where I was, if I was okay.

I panicked. I drove home and got there around 2am. My husband was sitting in the living room with all the lights on. He looked terrified and then relieved and then angry. He asked where I was and I just, I don't know what came over me but I said ""I think we need to take a break.""

He stared at me like I'd slapped him. He said ""What? Right now? At 2am you want to tell me this?""

And I doubled down. I said I'd been feeling disconnected and needed space and maybe we should spend some time apart. He asked if there was someone else. I said ""That's none of your business. You don't get to know who I'm with or what I do during a break.""

His face went completely blank. He said ""Get out.""

I said I lived here too and he said ""Then I'll leave."" He went upstairs and I heard him moving around. I texted the pharma rep telling him things got messy but I'd handled it and we could be together now.

He didn't respond.

I went upstairs around 3am and the bedroom door was locked. I knocked and my husband said through the door ""I'm sleeping in here with the kids tonight. You can have the couch.""

I tried to argue but he wouldn't open the door.

I woke up around 9am to someone knocking. I answered and it was the pharma rep's wife. She's maybe 26, pregnant, holding a toddler. She said ""Are you \[my name\]?"" and I froze.

She said ""My husband's phone was open this morning. I saw everything. Every text, every photo you sent him. He told me it meant nothing and he's cutting contact but I wanted you to know you destroyed my family.""

Then she left.

I tried to call the pharma rep. Blocked. I tried to text him. Blocked.

I went upstairs to talk to my husband. The bedroom door was open but nobody was there. I checked my phone and saw he'd added me to a group chat with his parents, my parents, and his two sisters.

The chat was full of screenshots. Every text I'd sent to the pharma rep over six months. The flirty ones. The explicit ones. The ones where I complained about my husband being boring. The ones where I said I was planning to leave once I figured out the finances.

His last message in the chat said ""This is who she really is. I'm filing on Monday. The kids and I are staying with my parents. She can have the house for now.""

My mom called me crying. My dad called and just said ""How could you?"" and hung up. My mother-in-law left me a voicemail calling me a cheating whore who abandoned her grandchildren.

I drove to his parents' house. They wouldn't let me in. I could see my kids playing in the backyard through the fence and I started crying and my father-in-law came out and said if I didn't leave he'd call the police.

The pharma rep's wife must have told people at the hospital because when I went in for my Monday shift my supervisor called me into her office. Apparently the pharma rep filed a complaint saying I'd been harassing him and his company is threatening to pull their contract with the hospital if I'm not dealt with. I'm on suspension pending investigation.

My husband's divorce attorney sent a letter yesterday. He's asking for full custody, citing abandonment and infidelity. He documented that I left the house at 2am and told him he had no right to know where I was or who I was with. He has the texts where I called him boring and said I was planning my exit.

I have nobody. My parents aren't speaking to me. My friends all know. The pharma rep's wife posted about it on Facebook and tagged mutual acquaintances. My sister called and said I'm selfish and cruel and she doesn't want her kids around me.

I tried to explain to my husband that I was confused and made a mistake and the pharma rep manipulated me. He sent back a one-line text: ""You announced a break at 2am to cover an affair and told me I had no right to know who you were with. There's nothing to explain.""

I just wanted to feel wanted again. I didn't think it would go like this. My whole life fell apart in 48 hours because I panicked and said the wrong thing.

Was I wrong for how I handled this? Could I have done it differently?

“Hey girl. Ready to go shopping?”



“Kai?!” Lumina said. 



The Flareon put on a cocky grin. “‘Sup? I just finished…. Uh, bathing.” *Oh dear.* He thought, *does she think I’m weird*?



Lumina snorted. “Sure. StaryuGuarantee we go. But I’m sure you were just rizzing the girls up, on what you call, ‘bathing’” She  added, snarkily. Walking past him, the Glaceon radiated cold grace and regality, like, literally, she emitted cold air. 



Kai followed her hesitantly, hearing the screams and shouts of excitement and desperation of Midnight, Esmeralda and Hermes. “Lumi… Alic—“ as soon as he muttered out the name of her mother, Lumina whirled around defiantly, her fangs bared. “Don’t mention her name.” She demanded, her eyes on fire. “She told me I was too “overprotective” of things. Oh please. It’s a *sofa*. Everyone uses it. Don’t accuse me. My, ‘mother’ who so loved me wanted me to change my personality, Kai. My *personality*. *Your* mother. Tell me what did she do?” Her ears awaited an answer as they twitched expectantly. “Kai.”



“She… she took care of me. She embraced the Flareon I’ve become. For good or for bad.” Kai said, lowering his ears. “I-i’m sorry, Lumina. I-i didn’t know.” 



Suddenly, the Glaceon perked up, her eyes widening. “I—i shouldn’t have spilled my private history. Neither should have you.” She blushed deep red, realizing that she made him spill the beans… and hers, too. Her tail curling up defensively around her paws, she scowled, again, putting up her defensive barrier around her brain. “

Et’s 



Kai dimly felt his soul getting annoyed with this mood-swingy Glaceon. “Are you kidding me? What’s with your emotions, anyway?! Never mind. I’m not talking about it anymore. I’m sure our Eeveelution friends have heard enough.” He cocked his head towards the Leafeon and Vaporeon who had their ears pressed against the glass. 



Apparently just realizing how much could’ve heard her past, Lumina hissed and spat at their direction, the two Pokémon suddenly busy wiping the glass of ‘smudges’. 



The whole time the walked on the path, the nearest city a mile away, she remained quiet, quite unable to look at his face. 



“I guess you’re one of the only ones I’ve ever mentioned this to… aside from Inari, a shiny Zoroark that I’m related to. He’s living a happy life with (spoiler, spoiler, spoiler!) April, he had a bad past too. Perhaps even worse than mine.” Lumina said, her eyes glazed over, as if envisioning what could be happening to Inari. “But don’t take this seriously. 



“Really?” Skepticism crept into the Flareon’s heart. *The second one.*

“I- again, I guess Gaia and Kym are the third and fourth, but… considering they’d probably spread it, it wouldn’t be much a secret anymore. Who ever heard it first, second, last… the placement doesn’t matter.” 



“Would it be weird, if I asked you on how to confess to someone?” Kai asked suddenly, out of the blue. 

“No… unless you’re taken.” Lumina answered, just until they reached the city. “My suggestion? Tell them how much they mean to you. Like, not the siblingy way. C’mon. There’s the furniture shop. Elburr’s Furniture.”



Together, side by side, they entered the shop, and greeted by Elburr Kittes, the Excadrill.



“Hey yer, Lumina and Kai. Need to buy sem furniture?” He said. 



“Hey Mr. Kittes!” Lumina said in return, with very forced cheerfulness. “We’re looking for a sofa, the StaryuGuarantee brand?” 

Elburr nodded his head along her lines. “Yes. C’mere Miss.” he squinted at Kai. “Are you coming?”

“No. I’d-i’d prefer not to.”

While Kai waited, he had the thought to rush to buy coffee, and maybe just maybe… 

While his thoughts wandered ‘round, he decided he’d just wait. Patiently. Which he was not good at. 



Until he was forced to go out and buy…



Something.



After a devastating 30 minutes of going around the city, he got a text from Lumina.



*Kai. I’m done. I told Elburr we’ll hitch a ride with him back home. Will expect you within five minutes. 🙂*



He rushed to Elburr’s Furniture, reuniting with Lumina. The two promptly went into the truck, along with Elburr, who was driving. 



“Where’d you go?” Lumina asked quietly. 

“I just… bought coffee.” He answered absentmindedly, as if pondering something.



Time skip ten minutes.



“Oh my Arceus- StaryuGuarantee, again?!” Gaia yelled. “Also, Lumi, we didn’t know your story was a sob story! Kym cried for a beastly ten minutes!”

“Oh, is it bigger?” Kym added inquisitively. “Uh, the sofa, I mean.” 

“LUMIIIIINA! WE ALL GOT THE BEANS FROM YOUR STORY—HOLY MILTANK! WE DIDN’T EXPECT IT TO BE LIKE THAT!” Athena came scramming out of the door, shouting so loud that Kai was sure she could be heard a mile away. 



“Give her space.” Grumbled Elburr, stuffing the box into the house. “Kai. I suspect you boys can handle it?” 

Kai nodded vigorously. “Yes, Mr. Kittes.”

“Good.” 



After he left, Lumina went indoors and went up. “See you guys later.” She muttered. 

“W-wait! Lumiiiiii! We still need to talk to you!” Gaia wailed. 

Esmeralda popped out behind the TV, putting her controller down. “They told us everything.” She told Kai. “I told ‘em to not, but they love their gossip. I had to calm everyone down…” 

“Thanks for the effort.” Kai told her gratefully. “How’d the others react?” 

“Let’s see…

Midnight didn’t care that much, Hermes dropped the controller and zoomed around the living room… Athena at first didn’t really turn crazy, until now. I… told them not to gang up on her. Oh, and Adam thought it was *hilarious*. Can you believe the nerve?” Esmeralda still seemed agitated, yet she pulled together well. 



“I’ll go to her.” Kai went up the stairs and knocked into her room before entering. Lumina was on her bed, reading a book. 



“Leave me alone,” she snapped, not even glancing at him. 

Kai hesitated, perhaps appalled  by the sharp edge of her voice. Nevertheless he sat next to her. “I’m not trustworthy, am I?” He admitted. “Usually when someone tells me their life story others… manage to know and spread the word. You’re lucky you didn’t tell me at… school. You know. Bullies?” He chuckled, which dissolved quickly into air. 



The Glaceon didn’t speak.



“I mean, I get it, if I had a past as horrible as yours,” he continued.



No response.

Ignored. x2.



“I guess… I’m lucky?” He shot a quizzical look at her.



Not even a glance.

Ignored, x3



“If you’re not going to talk, I’m leaving.” Kai felt fed up with her, her personality was so enraging.



“You’d better go, then.” Her voice came out meek, hopeful. 

“But you spoke.” He pointed out, only to be greeted by ice cold fangs. “Are you going to use Ice Fang on me?” He speculated, stepping slowly out. 



“Yes.” She agreed, a smirk coming on her face. “Now go, before you get Ice Fanged.” 

\~+\~

“Well? Any luck?” Esmeralda asked, once he got down. 

He shook his head in response. 

Gaia looked disappointed. “Oh Deerling, how I thought fire can melt ice.” She said the last part dramatically, probably expecting ‘ahs’ and ‘oohs’. None came.



With her wet tail slapping against the cold stone floors, Kym looked very mutinous. “ARE YOU— GRIMER KIDDING ME?!” She said, her scales glinting violet, silver, gold…

“I- I thought I knew the Pokéname things better.” Athena chimed in, her snout smeared with frosting. 

Midnight appeared behind her, holding a stack of books. “The news was surprising.” He admitted. “I didn’t show any emotion, but deep inside my soul sobbed.” He put a paw to his forehead, and then got a feeler slap from Athena. Esmeralda choked in a giggle. Gaia and Kym spoke in hushed tones behind the sofa, maybe talking on how they’d get Lumina to spill more. 

 

Hermes suddenly howled, causing Kai and Athena to jump. “FENNEKIN! I had over ten thousand points! And y’all’s yapping caused me to loose it!” He stood up, his shaggy fur crackling with electricity. 

“Dude!” Kai said. “I thought you zoomed around the living room, once you heard the news?!”

“Yes, I did!” Hermes exclaimed. “Buuut right now I’m really focused on my game, so I didn’t speak. But now I lost, I’ll tell you what I want to say, oh my Arceus. Alright. Done. Bye.” He raced out of the living room and into the kitchen, probably to nab some cupcakes in the fridge. 



Esmeralda shook her head, apparently very unsurprised. “I beat him earlier. He was training so he can beat *me*, now.”

Athena held out a stack of papers. “Later.” She said, “I’m cooking dinner, and my assistant will be Lumina. We’re dining cold dishes, baby.”",1,1762873025.0,u_Yawning-Kitty0916,0,1.0,False

1oubheb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1oubheb/how_would_i_know_to_respond_to_that/,How would i know to respond to that?,"So a couple days ago i was at an airport getting coffee. I was ordering on a kiosk and minding my business. One of the workers (late 20sf) started yelling mommy across the cafe. I looked up but she wasn't even looking in my direction (and why would i respond to mommy? Also 22f) so i go back to ordering but she keeps yelling mommy so I'm keeping an eye on her.

 She starts kinda shaking her hand while yelling but again she never looked at me so i kept minding my business. She goes to her coworker and goes ""is she fucking deaf"". Her coworker yells mommy again but this time she looks at me so i respond asking if they've been talking to me.

They say obviously and tell me i need to listen (why would i respond to someone yelling mommy who isn't even looking in my direction!!) I asked what they wanted and they didn't even have anything to ask or say to me. 

I get back to ordering but they literally start laughing and pointing at me and whispering to each other in front of me. I finish ordering my latte, sandwhich, and pepsi. The main girl then tells me I'm not getting a latte cause she doesn't feel like making espresso so I'm getting a cold brew. I honestly don't even care at this point so i just say ok. 

I wait for my coffee to be done and i ask for an extra cup of ice for the Pepsi. I get my coffee but I'm waiting for the Pepsi and sandwich. I wait about 5 minutes (i wasnt in a rush or anything so i didn't mind that) and her coworker comes up and asks why I'm waiting and i say for the Pepsi and sandwich. At first they try to claim i didn't even order a sandwich and am trying to get one for free. I show them the receipt where i did indeed pay for it and they told me i had to go on the side and behind the Cafe for both of them to just pick up from the fridges. They start making fun of me for not knowing and being ""stupid"". 

When i walk away to get them i say ""how would i know if no one tells me?"" That pisses the main one off. First she tells me to say that to her face which is odd cause i said it directly to her the first time as well. So i repeated it and she tells me to ""fucking listen better when someone calls you"" at this point i shake my head and walk off. 

When i retrieved my stuff i came back round the front but she didn't know i was there apparently because her supervisor (her supervisor had been in and out the whole time) was there and they were once again making fun of me for being ""so fucking stupid"" 

When i walk by i tell her not to take her bad day out on me (she had been complaining about having to pay her babysitter extra today) and walk off but at this point i was tearing up from all the insults. 

I calmed down pretty quick but it's just been bothering me slightly cause how else do they treat all the other people as well if that's how they treat me while minding my business",2,1762872893.0,Vent,3,0.75,False

Think going out for cocktails and dinner, clubbing, cute coffee dates, shopping days, doing our nails/hair/makeup together, and taking loads of pics (posting each other and hyping each other up ofc 💕). But also intelligent and have other interests cos as much as I love fashion its not the only thing I want to talk about lol!

I’m also a big fan of deep chats, not just surface-level stuff, I want genuine friendships where we can laugh one minute and talk about life the next 🫶

I do have a boyfriend so I’m **only looking for friendships**, but I’d love to build a small circle of girls who have similar energy: confident, kind, feminine, and fun. Ideally people around my age (19–24ish), who like that “pretty girls supporting pretty girls” vibe 🌸

If we click, I’d love to move the chat over to Insta or Snap rather than keeping it on Reddit - it just feels more natural for getting to know each other!

  
I’m a girl who, whilst is very busy, loves to go out and do things, but be warned I do work full time so it would be once every 2 weeks meet ups, not that interested in online only friendships (how are you supposed to take cute piccies?!)

On lineageos, however, I can't find a way to share apps with another user. It seems like the only way to get my (paid) media apps on the second user account would be to login to my google account in order to access my apps in the play store - which would completely defeat the purpose.

I personally love keeping a history of what items I bring and how they are used in a Google spreadsheet. After many years I have finally fine tuned how I plan and use my spreadsheet. This is how I use it:

*Columns:*

* Item category
* Item name
* Checkbox to indicate if packed
* Item quantity with trip name
* Item note with trip name

*Item Categories:*

* Clothing
* Jewelry
* Diabetic Supplies
* Health
* Toiletries
* Electronics
* Bags
* Misc
* Documents
* To-Dos

*Conditional formatting:*

* Green - if checkbox is checked (meaning item is packed) or quantity is 0
* Yellow - if quantity has a “?” meaning I need to determine if I am bringing that item or how much I need to bring

*Use:*

* I add a new “Item Quantity"" and “Item Note” column for each new trip, so I have a complete record of all my previous trips
* I don’t delete rows, I just add new ones so I have a history of all items I have brought on my trips
* I use filtering to exclude all of my “0” items so I can easily run down my spreadsheet and pack my items once my list is finalized for a specific trip
* I use the “note” column to add details of which specific items I’m packing, or after my trip to note if I used the item or what I would change about it
* I also have a category of “to dos” so I don’t forget to perform certain tasks before we leave on our trip (such as cleaning the coffee maker)

I’ve been balancing work and rest now after months of juggling everything so here I am, so trying to make the most out of every rest day I get.

1oub0bj,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancun/comments/1oub0bj/barcelo_maya_riviera_adults_only_review/,Barcelo Maya Riviera Adults Only Review,"TLDR: I give it a 9/10 after staying there a week, but it wasn’t entirely perfect. 

For context, I’ve spent a week at Riu Palace Las Americas and Riu Palace Kulkucan in the same Nov/Dec timeframe, so that’s what I’ll compare it to: 

Food: 9/10

Compared to the Riu Properties, the food here was all pretty good. I enjoyed most of the specialty restaurants, especially the hibachi in the Japanese restaurant and taco bar inside the Mexican restaurant. 

The Buffett was above average as well, with most food being pretty edible, stick to the stations where they cook the food in front of you (omelette, quesadilla etc). Coffee was 100% better than Riu as well. 

My biggest complaint is that for late night snacks, you’re relegated to getting below par cold sandwiches from the lobby bar or trekking to one of the other resorts or mall for food (not awful, a little inconvenient)

Property/room: 9/10

The property is gorgeous, amazingly well kept and massive. 

We just got the junior suite facing the jungle and it was more than enough for us. 
The bed in the room is huge and very comfortable and pillows are good too. Bathroom is up to par. 

The infinity pools are very nice, thoughtfully designed and massive. The beach itself is very clean with perfect sand and the water was great. We did not enjoy getting in the ocean water due to the bottom being more mud than sand (kinda like a lake bottom).

The shared spaces outside of the pool are a bit lacking, as they were definitely designed for aesthetics and not comfort or use. 

They were doing some construction on the entrance due to part of the roof falling off while we were here, so it was kinda annoying. 

The resort has 850 rooms and is spread out instead of spread up, so you will do some serious walking just around the resort every day. 

The Barcelo Maya complex is incredibly large and isolated, so it is kinda tough (and decently pricy) to get out to somewhere like PDC. 

Entertainment: 8/10

This is really where Barcelo stumbles vs my other Riu experiences. 

The “entertainment” team (while very nice personally) really doesn’t engage in the same way with guests as the Riu ones. They did a nice little Day of the Dead memorial, but outside of that, didn’t really see them throughout the day. 

At night, there wasn’t really any variability in the entertainment offered. Usually an hour to an hour and a half of bad karaoke followed by a “band” which seemed like the same mariachi band in different outfits. There wasn’t a silent disco or dancing show or anything like that. 

Just not as actioned packed as the Riu days were (which might be the vibe they’re going for). 

We did try out the communal club (Club Jaguar) and it was alright. Mostly played Latin music and was jam packed with 18yr olds. 

Service: 9/10

Overall, the service is top notch. Everyone was very nice and attentive. The few things I can demerit them for is the lack of bartenders/waiters at the pool. There seemed to only be two bartenders per bar, making the process slow. 

The other thing is that they are very strict with carrying plates out of the buffet, which is not allowed. I tried to bring my wife some breakfast snacks and got yelled at… I understand not bringing glass by the pool, but I was just trying to bring some stuff back to my room.

1ouaxar,https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/1ouaxar/empire_of_the_stars_by_melissa_cave_is_my_latest/,Empire of the Stars by Melissa Cave is my latest obsession,"I just finished the 3rd book which released this month and I'm completely stricken. I completely devoured books 1 & 2 and was leaking tears throughout them both and the 3rd one had me feeling so tenderhearted and vulnerable. Now, this isn't an example of tragedy porn; you simply get so connected to the main AND side characters in the lush and vibrant setting they live in. Every heartbreaking they feel is transmitted directly to me and I'm a little mess of snotty noses and tissue paper.

THIS is the Romantasy series I've been craving. An excellent and REFRESHING example of ""show don't tell"". After I slogged through 2 books of Crescent City (a veritable firehose delivery of ""tell don't show"") these books were a breath of fresh air.

The romance?? Tender and genuine, their relationship is rocky and trust is slowly built until you feel like they could genuinely love each other deeply. The emotional breakthrough is something like a slow burn.

The world building??? Rich, vibrant, and almost effortless. You truly can just read it as it washes over you and pick up little bits of detail and history as it goes on. I never felt caught out or like I missed some important detail.

The cast of characters?????? Beloved, widely varied, and completely fleshed out. It truly felt like it was a village, an army, a family of a wide range of personalities and dispositions. Everyone felt so three dimensional and real. I was genuinely connected to and cared about each of the citizens of this world.

The plot??? Hold my coffee so I can gesticulate wildly with my hands because it had me in grips. A knight, forged in betrayal, blood, and battles has zero room for trust with the sacred emperor of the empire constantly making attempts on his life from the tender age of nine. A bastard princess, raised in secrecy and shown no love from her fostery family, with a deep fire of curiosity, intelligence, and innocence burning inside her. These two are bound together in marriage, as this knight, Remin, claims the princess, Ophele, as his prize for the crushing victory over the empire's enemies. With this princess, he will use her sacred bloodline to restore and guarantee his house's legacy all while building a whole new duchy from scratch in a wild and hostile, never before settled quite like he has in mind. Can they come together,tame this wild land, and survive the crushing opposition of the Emporer????!! Aaaaahh! Obsessed. 
Cannot recommend it enough because I actually NEED someone to talk to about the ending of book 3, I just finished it and I'm in pieces.

I've been using 0.05 for a couple of months now. No purging or dryness that I've noticed except for my lips. I've always had crazy greasy skin so I'm not surprised that my skin hasn't dried out too much, but I'd love some help with how to keep my lips from drying out. I have been avoiding my mouth area since the dryness started, and am applying lanolin (because I happened to have a few tubes of nipple cream left from breastfeeding).

I've also seen that waxing is cautioned against when using tretinoin, but I'm not sure how else to get rid of my moustache - I have reacted to depilatory creams in the past and it seems like it would be even worse after using tret? 

I'm 42, wash with a foaming wash every night followed by tret followed by an Aldi moisturiser (in theory - in practice I have ADHD so like 4 times a week). Morning routine is coffee if I have time and when I get to work I may look in a mirror to remove the most egregious stains my children have left on my face that day.

I started Ozempic this week, and whoa… this is not a drug to mess around with. In addition to PCOS, I also have Type 2 diabetes, so my doctor has been suggesting a GLP-1 for years. Even though I’m a textbook candidate, I hesitated because I’ve struggled with disordered and restrictive eating in the past.

Before this, I tried metformin, which gave me constant diarrhea and tanked my B12 levels. Then I moved to an SGLT2, which I actually liked, but it came with intense cravings and some weird hormone side effects — I even started having breakthrough bleeding despite being stable on my birth control for years. My weight bounced around a lot on that one.

This month I finally got insurance approval for Ozempic. I did my first injection Sunday morning, and within hours, the constant food noise I’ve lived with since puberty just… stopped. Honestly, it felt euphoric at first — like my thoughts were mine again, not dictated by food.

But it’s also been hard. I’m struggling to eat enough. My normal breakfast (two eggs, one slice of toast, one sliced Roma tomato, coffee) now feels like a massive meal, and I haven’t finished it all week. I literally don’t feel hunger — but if I go too long without food, I get dizzy and nauseated. I crave warm liquids more than solid food; things like hot tea or soup feel comforting, while a plate of food feels like work.

So yeah — this drug is powerful, and not something to take lightly. The mental quiet it brings is wild, but the physical adjustment is serious. I’m grateful I had time on metformin and an SGLT2 first — they taught me how my body reacts to big shifts like this.

It’s only been a week, but I feel cautiously optimistic. For the first time in my life, I can imagine a peaceful relationship with food. If you’re considering Ozempic for PCOS, do it with medical supervision and self-awareness. I mean, very specifically make sure you have a medical team you like which includes a doctor who hears you. I'm also relying on a nutritionist to make sure I don't drastically undereat and a therapist to help monitor my mental health. GLP-1s are not an easy drug. They are as powerful as I worried, but honestly, for PCOS they might just be exactly what you need. ",2,1762871224.0,PCOS,3,1.0,False

1ouaqsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaladaptiveDreaming/comments/1ouaqsg/recovery_from_maladaptive_daydreaming/,Recovery from Maladaptive Daydreaming,"For years, I thought my real life was something I just had to tolerate between daydreams. My fantasy world was more colorful, more forgiving, and loving. I’d pace around for hours, whispering dialogue to myself like an actor in a movie no one else could see. It felt like control — until I realized it was actually escape.

I had maladaptive daydreaming so bad that it wrecked my sleep, my studies, and my focus. I’d lose whole days (and  at worst points in my life, months) to imaginary scenarios that made me feel alive, but left me empty after. I wasn’t living- just existing. 

Recovery wasn’t a dramatic one-day epiphany. It was slow, ugly, and full of relapses. But here’s what helped:

1. Naming it. Once I stopped calling it “just imagination” and recognized it as a coping mechanism, I could face it instead of romanticizing it.


2. Getting professional help. I went to a psychiatrist and described to them my maladaptive daydreaming and other repetitive behaviour. They diagnosed me with OCD. It took me several medications and a new psychiatrist over a period of 2 years to find the medication recipe that'll work for me. I'm on fluoxitine 80 mg and aripiprazole 10mg everyday. Aripiprazole makes me fatigued so I drink black coffee.


3. Replacing fantasy with friction. I forced myself to do uncomfortable real things — studying, socializing. Initially reality felt like sandpaper, but it doesn't hurt anymore after I started my magic formula (fluoxitine 80 mg and aripiprazole 10mg) and avoiding my triggers.


Now I still have an imagination, but it’s not my addiction anymore. My mind finally shuts up when I want it to. The possibility of silence used to scare me — now it feels like peace.

To anyone still lost in your head: you’re not weak. You built an entire world because this one hurt too much. That’s not failure — that’s creativity in survival mode. But you can come back. You can build something more here, in the real world. ",3,1762871091.0,MaladaptiveDreaming,1,1.0,False
1ouaqqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Neurodivergent/comments/1ouaqqf/i_am_a_confused_individual/,I am a confused individual,"I've been questioning and suspecting autism and possibly adhd for about a year now.  I've finally made some progress with my primary care doctor because my life is just too chaotic.

I do have a neurodevelopmental disorder that I can confirm but I've never been formally diagnosed with autism or ADHD.  Just social anxiety disorder.  I have more than several comorbidities with autism.  But I'm confused because I also see some contradictions and I don't want to be factitious.

I've always been outgoing and extroverted socially.  Although this has come with a lifetime of criticism for being weird.  I do stim A LOT.  But for restrictive behaviors I feel like I have to come up with something.  I do have preferences, like how I make/drink my coffee.  Dickies dri tech socks.  SNEAKERS.  I don't mind new experiences, but I need to feel grounded first.  Novel experiences in my life have a lot of times been a need to escape chaos.  But not always though.

Every assessment, self administered and from my doctor, says that I score a high probability of being autistic.  But I have some doubts because I'm not sure if I fully meet the criteria.  Especially with the restricted behavior part.  I do crave structure and groundedness but I'm so used to not having that available to me.  Now I'm on antidepressants.

I did meet a friend, Evan, at work years ago who told me they had Asperger's.  And I found this surprising at first because Evan seemed pretty normal to me.  A coworker asked me why I hang out with him?  He said that I wasn't weird like he was.  I responded, because I'm also a big dork.  (Or something to that extent, I can't remember exactly).  But Evan is the only autistic person I know that I could share a similar neurotype with.  Comparably to anyone else I know on the spectrum though, I probably come off as pretty normal.

Part of me thinks this is real, and I've been conditioned by my ableist family and society to mask myself.  But the other part doubts this. And maybe I'm just being delusional because I'm deeply depressed and hardly get to do or be who I want to be.",2,1762871088.0,Neurodivergent,2,1.0,False
1ouaqbi,https://i.redd.it/o9e20wwq0n0g1.png,Weird Fishes,"""Welcome aboard, Terrence, me lad!"" The Captain's voice thundered out, drawing a dark look from the woman sitting in the booth behind him. His outburst had shattered the quiet atmosphere of Linda's Roadside Diner, and when she dropped her coffee cup it had shattered in much the same way. As she fussed over her scrambled eggs, I poked at my own and thought adding some coffee might be an improvement. 


I had spent my last two dollars on the plate of runny eggs. They tasted faintly of salmon, and I quietly cursed the cook for making my eggs in the same pan as the Captain's fish. He had noticed me from across the diner and come to sit in my booth. He said he saw hunger in me, and laughed heartily when I dryly pointed out where we were. 


""You'll fit right in, me boy."" The Captain's smile carried a sense of implicit brotherhood. 


He had been right, of course. I was hungry, and I was very broke. When I left home to travel the world as a vagabond, I had underestimated the amount of desperation I would face. I remember worrying that I had come across as overeager when I accepted the job offer. I would be joining his crew for a three day commercial fishing voyage, with halibut as our quarry. 


I finished my meal without saying another word as the Captain gushed about his boat, his crew, and the open ocean. 


We drove together for three hours to a dock somewhere in the northern half of Massachusetts. We thundered down the interstate, and the Captain continued to prove himself a caricature by singing shanties the whole way. There were many times I found myself fearing that the Captain's ancient Pontiac might break down and leave us stranded somewhere along I-95. I was so thankful to have arrived without incident that I had completely forgotten there were others who would be joining us. Hauling my heavy luggage, I let my eyes wander over the area. The sand here looked dull, as if the color had been muted somehow from the usual beige sands into a depressing, greyish facsimile of the color sand is meant to be. The dock, well, ramshackle would have been too kind a word. The small staircase sat askew, with handrails held together by nails plainly visible in the overcast gloom of the afternoon. The rails had been pulled away from their posts by gravity as the rest of the dock drifted out to sea. 


As we made our way up the ragged stairs, I found myself thinking that the Captain looked every bit as creaky and dilapidated as the dock. His gait was dramatically marred by a limp of the left leg, as if it were slightly shorter than his right. His right arm swung freely as he moved, while the left dangled stiffly at his side. I wondered if the Captain, like the dock, had been stretched and distorted by the force which, like the shifting tides, pulled him out to the sea. 


""Ain't she a beauty, me lad?"" The Captain breathed out the question with awe and admiration laced into his voice. 


The ship was in much better shape than the dock. It was right around 40 feet long, with clean sleek siding. The absence of any marring of the hull told me that either the Captain was incredibly vigilant in the removal of barnacles, or the barnacles had never chosen to attach themselves to the ship to begin with. The cabin was relatively spacious, painted stark white contrasting beautifully against the ocean’s surface and the grey clouds above. Cursive letters, painted in red, told me the name of the ship. ""The Minnow."" 


""I'll say."" I muttered half-heartedly. It was a beautiful ship, but I was not a man with an eye for such things. ""Your boat is certainly much nicer than your car."" 


The sound of the Captain's laughter told me my risky remark had been worth it. He left me to settle in, claiming that he had to make sure everything was ready to go. I was putting my bags away in what meager storage the ship could afford me when I heard something that made me jump. 


It was a voice, low, and slow. Deeper and more cracked than any human voice I've heard before or since. It rasped out to me from the darkest corner of the room. 


""Hi! Oh, sorry. Frog in my throat! Haha."" He cleared his throat and spoke again. This time, his voice was perfectly ordinary. ""I'm Jared. Nice to meet you."" 


Jared got up and stepped into the negligible light which seeped down into the crew's quarters. He was Asian, possibly Chinese, with jeans that looked too big for him, and a jacket to match. 


""Nice to meet you too, I'm Terrence. Terrence Howard. Not that one, though, obviously."" I kicked myself for unnecessarily clarifying that I am not Hollywood star Terrence Howard. If I was going to be spending a week at sea with these guys, I couldn't afford to make myself out to be a weirdo. 


""Pleased to make your acquaintance, Terrence Howard. I loved you in Iron Man. So, where did the Captain find you? He picked me up from outside a Home Depot."" I don't know if people know this about being homeless, but you don't get too many folks interested in your life story. I seized on the opportunity with more gusto than I probably should have, and by the end of the night, Jared and I were on track to becoming fast friends. 


Besides Jared and I, there were three others on the vessel, not including the Captain. There was John Laramie, an elderly man with a peg leg and the face of a bulldog, who would be serving as the Captain's first mate. Then there were Sasha and Alexei Novikov, Russian twins who had fled their homeland to evade service in the war against Ukraine. These two would be working with Jared and I as deckhands. We had all made our introductions, and we were tickled to find that every one of us had been vagrants before crossing paths with Captain Yorke. I joined several others in ribbing the Captain about his crew of runaways and vagabonds, and as we laughed I caught sight of the last member of the crew. 


He had stood in abject silence, never uttering a word. Instead of joining in any conversations he simply flicked his shallow, verdant eyes from person to person, as if observing us. Hoping to garner as much information about others while sharing none about himself. I made my way over to break the ice. 


""Hello, I'm Terrance Howard."" His only response to this was to raise his eyebrows, so I pushed on. ""Where are you from?"" 


He didn't reply, he simply kept his eyes locked on mine and gave an insincere smile. Something in the way he was looking at me, saying nothing, made my skin crawl. The longer we stood together in silence, the more frightened of him I became. We were adrift in the endless expanse of the Earth's oceans, surrounded on all sides by the darkness of the early morning, and yet the most terrifying part of it all was this man. This implacable statue, standing tall and silent. Staring accusation into my soul. 

""Ah, that's Jeff! He's a friendly enough fella, but completely incapable of speech, I fear. He's what they call a mute."" The Captain had appeared, as if out of thin air, directly behind me. 


The tension I had felt melted away. I kicked myself for leaping to thoughts of paranormal stowaways before considering a simple disability. I reached out to shake Jeff's hand, and was pleased when he reciprocated the gesture. His hand was rough like sandpaper against my own, and wonderfully warm against the brisk morning winds. 


The Captain excused himself from my company and made his way forward to address the crew. 


""Alright, lads. We've got a long week of hard fishing ahead."" The Captain droned out, with the last word of the sentence trailing off. ""We set out nets at first light, go get some grub and be ready when the time comes."" There was elation in the Captain's voice. I could tell that he lived for these voyages. 


Jared and I sat together at breakfast, without much of anything to talk about. We had been discussing the most recent season of ""The Masked Singer"" when the Captain flung open the door and called us all to our tasks. 


The day's work passed by in such a blur that I could hardly believe it when I first saw the moon. There was something therapeutic in the mindless labor. We had been laughing and joking amongst ourselves so much that the work had stopped feeling like work at all. That mood, unfortunately, wouldn't last. 


The Captain stood before us in the dining area that night, noticeably shorter than when we had departed. I had a hard time putting my finger on what was giving me the impression that the Captain was profoundly sorrowful, but I figured it out about halfway through his speech. Something in his face had shifted, giving way for his eyeballs to become ever so slightly larger than they had been. 


""Is the Captain sick or something? He looked kinda off today."" I mused to Jared as we lay down for the night. 


""Dunno, I didn't notice anything. Why?"" He replied. 


""I'm not sure. It's probably nothing."" I said, deciding to drop the subject. I told myself I couldn't lie awake all night thinking about things I had probably just imagined. 


The next morning, I found myself working closely with the first mate, Mr. Laramie. We had been assigned to the gutting and freezing of the previous day's catch. 


""So Mr. Laramie,"" I picked up a halibut with a particularly sad look in its dead eyes and sliced it from tip to tail, ""Where are you from?"" 


""S'best not to talk, boy. Ye'll get the guts in yer mouth."" He spat the sentence out at me, and I took the cue to shut up. 


We worked together in silence, processing the hundred or so fish which felt like thousands at the time. 


""Okay, but you can at least tell me where you're fr-"" my sentence died in my throat. A particularly full stomach had fallen from the halibut Mr. Laramie had just gutted, landing with a crash and sending a ribbon of fish intestine soaring into my mouth. The scrap of viscera landed on my tongue, leaving behind an oily, bitter film. Mr. Laramie laughed hysterically as I retched over a barrel. 



After ten minutes of scraping my tongue and gargling seawater, I was ready to return to work. 


""Y'alright now, boy?"" Mr. Laramie had softened significantly after laughing at my misfortune. 


""Yeah, I'm fine. Pass me that stomach, I want to see what the hell this thing ate."" He handed it over, and I sliced it open. I had expected a workboot, or a can of beans and another round of laughs. I had not expected a small, humanoid being with large, bulbous eyes which hung suspended from stalks protruding from where the eye socket would typically be found on a human. 


""Go fetch the cap'n."" Mr. Laramie whispered, with his face stark white in the fluorescent light of the ship's processing station. 


The Captain followed me back to the station while I tried, and failed, to explain what we'd found. When he entered the cramped room full of death and viscera, his eyes instantly locked on the tiny corpse. 


""WHAT IN THE BLUE BLAZES HAVE YE DONE? I OUGHT TO THROW THE BOTH OF YE OUT INTO THE BLOODY SEA AND LET HER HAVE HER WAY WITH YE."" The Captain had flown into a rage, with tears in his eyes and a face as red as an apple's ass. 


""Now hol' on Cap'n, it weren't the boy's fault we were ju-"" I appreciated Mr. Laramie defending me, but Captain Yorke clearly did not. He cut Laramie off mid-sentence. 


""So yer saying it was you then, are ye Mr. Laramie? Ye and ye alone killed that poor child? Twas ye who may doom us all then, aye, Mr. Laramie?"" His accent shifted in strange ways as the anger waxed and waned. 


""No! No Captain, it were the fish what did it. The boy and I found the poor thing dead in the belly of a halibut."" Mr. Laramie seemed like he might cry. I hoped he wouldn't, as I've never been able to handle the sight of an old man crying. 


The Captain's rage had died immediately once he understood what had happened. He solemnly crossed the room, and discarded the body into the sea. 


""Neither of ye are to speak of this."" The Captain muttered, turning on his heel to storm out of the room. 


""What the fuck was that?"" I asked Mr. Laramie, who was clearly just as perplexed. He just stared back at me, stunned, with his jaw hanging open. 


When Jared asked me how working with the first mate had been,  I thought about telling him the truth. In the end, I decided to obey the Captain and keep it to myself. 


""It was...fine."" I said. Better to lie by omission. 


""Well you really missed out today. You know those Russian fellas? Well, they were doing this bit where they got on either end of a fish and pretended they were fu-"" Listening to the stories of the day's hijinks brought me peace enough that I fell asleep while he spoke. 


I was the first to wake the next morning, and I made my way onto the deck to enjoy the sea breeze air. I decided to walk laps around the deck, and it wasn't until the third or fourth that my foot brushed against the body. The corpse was lying flat on the deck, barely concealed between two fishing nets. I pulled the nets away, and revealed a pale face which had become bloated to an unimaginable degree. It was so severe that the features were nigh upon indiscernible, aside from his mouth.  A thin trail of water trickled from the engorged orifice,  and in desperation I turned the man onto his side. If he had drowned, then there was a chance he could be resuscitated, or at least thats what I had thought at the time. 


When I turned him, gallons of water began to rapidly force their way out through his blue lips, carrying out hundreds of tiny orbs. His skin began to visibly sag, progressing further and further until the dead man was left as nothing more than a sack of crumpled skin lying on the deck. 


The thing they don't tell you about being out at sea, is that the winds steal away the sound of your screams. I'm not sure how long I sat there in the dark, pawing at the crumpled remains and screaming for help which could not hear me. 


 I shuffled myself to the Captain's quarters in a daze. When he finally answered my pounding at his door, I could only point towards the area where I had found the body. I followed him over, stopping just short of where the body would be visible. I heard the Captain shout in horror, and he rushed off to rouse the crew. 


We all gathered for a headcount. Myself, Alexei, Sasha, Jared, and the Captain were all accounted for. That left Mr. Laramie as the only one missing. The Captain grabbed up the empty skin and shook it out in the same way one unfurls a flag. He held the remains up against the emerging morning sun, as if to confirm the identity. The light passed through the limp husk easily, causing the whole body to glow a dim orange as we stared on in silence. 


We all coped in different ways. I tried my best to find some rational explanation for what I'd seen, but there was none. I even tried the irrational ones. I found myself thinking of the Kelpie of Scottish folklore and how it would drown men on dry land. I had to shake the thoughts away, as they kept leading my mind back to the image of Mr. Laramie's distorted face. The Russians, in true form, had taken to indulging in alcoholism. Jared decided to play den mother, checking in on everybody. Jeff, who usually kept a fair bit of distance, had begun to gravitate toward the group much more strongly. We were all together in the common area when the ship lurched forward, and stopped dead. 


I stared at the decimated engine in disbelief, feeling my soul wither at the hopeless wreck before me. It had been clearly and brutally sabotaged, with fuel lines which looked more like they'd been ripped than cut. The room reeked of oil, diesel, and grinding metal. If we tried to keep it running, it would only destroy itself in the process. We had no choice but to shut it down.  The Captain reached out and put his hand on my shoulder. It was icy cold, and my shirt was left wet when he pulled back. 


""S'alright, lad. Alexei'll have us fixed up in no time. Just think of how many fish we'll catch while we wait, me boy!"" His eyes did something strange then. They seemed to move and stretch, as if trying to separate from one another. 


""Captain... are you feeling well?"" I asked, genuinely concerned. 


""Never better, me boy!"" Once again his eyeballs seemed to try and flee from each other. ""Now let's get to work!"" 


Jared and I tried to make small talk while we worked through the day, but mostly we just stood around in a daze. Our situation had grown incredibly dire, incredibly quickly.


The sun felt hot against my skin in a way I hadn't noticed before. The stench of fish, death, sweat, and rot seemed to penetrate my nostrils with unprecedented ferocity. The whole trip had been suddenly altered beyond recognition. It was impossible to believe we had been happy just a day before. 


As we went to bed that night, Jared asked the question I had been desperately trying to avoid asking myself. 


""Do you think we'll live to see dry land again?"" He sounded distant as he spoke, and I knew the question had been rhetorical. 


The next day began with a mote of hope, as Alexei and Sasha announced they had found a suitable replacement for the destroyed fuel lines. We all cheered the announcement, with the exception of Captain Yorke. He stood in the background of the celebration, with fear and surprise bursting from his eyes. 


Upon returning to our duties, it quickly became apparent that Jeff had gone missing. We all searched frantically, calling out for him and turning the ship over. Eventually we found him, wrapped up in a net and tied off to the side of the boat. Like whatever had killed him wanted to keep him close, but hidden. 


Jared and I called an emergency meeting of the remaining crew. Together, we accused the Captain, whose eyes had grown more tubular in their shape and at least twice their usual size, of being some sort of demon. It was the only thing that made sense. He was the one who had lured us all out here. He was the only person on the ship that seemed to be fucking mutating. It had to be him. 


""A demon? Listen to yerself, lad. What kind of demon would I be? What kind of demon would take a boatload o' fuckheads like you on a fishin voyage, let alone pay ye? Far as I'm concerned, neither one a ya are worth a damned dime."" I scoffed at the ridiculous rebuttal, but it quickly became apparent that Alexei and Sasha remained undecided. 


We divided the ship into two sections, fore and aft, with the Russians hunkering down in the engine room. The food and water would be kept in the middle to provide access to all parties. 

Jared was the first one who found Alexei that night. We were awoken by a massive clatter. Alexei and his brother, Sasha, had been working through the night to get us back up and running. Something had slashed Alexei viciously down his torso, spilling his guts out into his lap where he sat slumped against the engine. His mouth was moving in an attempt to speak last words, but none would come. He reminded me of one of the fish we had caught. Uselessly bumping his gums against each other in some vain attempt at one last act. We spread out and searched through the ship, but Sasha was nowhere to be found. 


By this point there were only the three of us left. Jared and I slept in shifts, and neither one of us saw any sign of Captain Yorke during the first night. The standoff lasted a few days, before we walked out onto the deck to find him with our food and water teetering on the ship's edge. 


""You can't hide from me forever, lads,"" he gently nudged our bottled water out into the waves, ""it's just us out here."" And he followed it up with the food. 


I shut the door. There was no more sense in going out if there was no supplies out there. We planned to escape via life raft, but a storm had blown in. It stayed for two days. On the second night of the storm, during my turn to take the watch, I succumbed to my exhaustion and fell asleep. 


I woke up two hours later in a panic. The storm had passed, and the sun was high in the sky. Jared was gone. I rushed out onto the deck, finding the Captain squatting over his lifeless, bloated form. I fell to my knees, buckling under the weight of sheer hopelessness. Captain Yorke turned to face me, and I saw his eyes had ballooned to ridiculous proportions, each as large as a soccer ball. They drooped down by his cheeks as the eyestalks they were mounted on failed to support the weight. The stalks themselves were grotesque, like sea sponges comprised of taut human skin. The Captain had visibly shrunken in terms of height, with his limbs growing thicker and less flexible but more powerful in a way which was horribly apparent. 


I wanted to pick myself up and flee back to the perceived safety of the room, but there was no point. I was going to have to sleep at some point. Even if he didn't come for me, I'd die to dehydration or starvation within days. My mouth had become so dry that my tongue felt like a wad of sandpaper prodding desperately for any trace of saliva. I resigned myself to death as the Captain leaped across the deck and landed on my chest. 


He held me firmly in place, distending his jaw and placing my entire head in his mouth. His icy lips locked around my neck, forming a seal. The afternoon sun bled red through the skin of his cheeks, providing just enough light to see water trickling in to the Captain's mouth. I struggled to free myself from him for five minutes which each felt like an hour. As the water level rose, I was able to smell the fact that it was not sea water. It was fresh. Drinkable. I was so desperate that I might have done it, if it hadn't been for the tiny orbs I'd felt bumping against every inch of submerged skin. My mouth was eventually covered, and the fluid had risen to just below my nose when I finally managed to break a hand free from the grasp of Captain Yorke. I flailed wildly, grabbed the first thing my hand found and pulled. 


A splash echoed across the deck as the Captain released me and began to howl in pain. I had grabbed his eyestalk, and pulled the whole thing clean off. I didn't waste my moment. I grabbed the other eye and yanked until it separated with a sickening squelch. The Captain stumbled blindly, slashing at the air with fingernails elongated into vicious claws. When he wandered too close to the edge, I delivered a kick which sent him plunging into the briny deep. I collapsed on the spot. 


I'm not sure how long I lay there drifting aimlessly through the sea. I'm pretty sure the dehydration affected my memory, as it's mostly just a blank. I do remember one night though. I'd say, maybe two days after I had killed Captain Yorke, I saw Jared's body suddenly shift, turning his head to lay against the deck. I heard water rushing out of his mouth and out toward the sea, and then, a few minutes later, I heard a tiny splash from the side of the ship. Like something very small had fallen, or jumped, down into the churning waves of the Atlantic. Then another. And another. Then ten more, and another ten after that until I had become completely convinced that there were thousands of *somethings* in the water all around. 


I was found a couple days later by a friendly fisherman who fed me and gave me water.  He even let me use his phone to get messages out to what few friends and family I have left. He said he's going to take me to his hometown to rest up before he drives me down to West Virginia. I'm going home to see my family again. I think of Jared and the others. I only just met them, and now they're dead and gone. I need to be somewhere that I'm known, no matter how bad it might be. Just a few days of rest in Innsmouth and then I'll be on my way.

1ouaq8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/StartUpIndia/comments/1ouaq8v/why_hate_for_nondeeptech_startups/,Why hate for non-DeepTech Startups?,"Hey everyone, ever since I was a child I used to live in Singapore and now I am attending a fairly presitigous college here in India, and just about two months back I had visited Singapore again after a break of about \~3 years, and what I found was astonishing.

  
Most startups that I had seen in Singapore directly in front of my eyes were all Chinese. But like what most people would expect, it was not about AI, humanoids etc, but it was all the F&B businesses. Random restaurants, with random weird ideas that people would probably make fun of in India saying that we shld focus on tech but I was surprised that nearly every single major Chinese F&B outlet had expanded because this wasnt there just before the pandemic or after. For example luckin coffee, I was starting to see this more than Starbucks and they don't really have any other offering other than just it being cheaper than starbucks. The numerous hotpot or chinese restuarants that have weird ideas on how to structure your food(think of it as a chinese burrito bowl) and restaurants where their USP would be weird type of entertainment etc. Most of these aren't deeptech but this was what I was seeing. Everywhere there were Chinese restuarant chains, some of them not even in English. 

And it baffled me because we always thought that we were massively behind in DeepTech, which we are. Our economy isn't big enough, not much investment in foundational research, but that day I found out that we are extremely behind even in arts and crafts, ecommerce, F&B etc. While every other person I meet here tells me that those ideas are useless and DeepTech is the future. The truth is the gap between us and bigger countries in the context non DeepTech industries is probably wider than DeepTech industries.  

We need to stop shaming F&B businesses esp on platforms like Shark Tank. Because food innovation is a thing. We might think it is useless, but the presentation and experience of food is actually a product that a lot of people consume. Just cause its less sexy dosen't mean its less worth of a business.

I’m in pretty decent shape 151 lbs 5’5” and I workout 5 days a week and get about 12-15k steps a day.. I had my second son and lost just about 35lbs in 17 months slow and steady .. I have finally hit a plateau and I have been in a deficit and I have taken maintenance breaks to help trick my metabolism but I can’t get my body fat lower than 28%.. I’m interested in seeing if 
I can move past my plateau with some fasting .. I am currently trying the dirty method cause I think for as active as I am it makes the most sense.. my last meal was Sunday around 5pm.. Monday morning at 5:30 I had black coffee and some oat milk.. then the rest of of day I kept it to water , some spindrift and one cup of beef bone broth at 6:30 that was it .. this morning at 5:30 had the same black coffee and oat milk hit the gym .. and thinking I’ll try to keep to the same stuff today .. I also had a stick of LMNT with my first water at the gym since it was a metabolic training lots of sweating .. how am I doing ? Could this work for my plateau? Will I lose fat or eat my muscle ?! I don’t know 🤷‍♀️help .. thoughts? I’m for it ",1,1762870923.0,DirtyFasting,0,1.0,False

One of the major symptoms for me was noticeable fatigue usually around mid day. But that went away about a month in and it had been great.

But now, the fatigue has come back…. It’s hard to wake up, it’s hard to get myself to go for work, I feel tired through the entire day and I don’t want to rely too much on coffee? Is this normal? I didn’t change the doze.",3,1762870877.0,prozac,4,1.0,False
1ouanoj,https://v.redd.it/zadn1co60n0g1,"Finally after so much trial and error, I got a decent shot","So, I have an Agaro imperial coffee machine and comes with a pressure basket. Coffee tasted pretty burnt with it. I kept searching for a bottomless porta filter which fits the machine but all them are loose and cause water leaks. So in the end I just went and cut open my stock porta filter and made it bottomless xD. 

Second problem was grinder, see I don't have money right now or I was not confident enough on it to invest so I went to blue tokai and got their Commercial grind. I think that works very well with these machines. 

Now enjoy the shot and lemme know what else can be improved. ",4,1762870875.0,IndiaCoffee,2,1.0,False
