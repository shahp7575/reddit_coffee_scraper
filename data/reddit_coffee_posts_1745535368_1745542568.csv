I was probably able to brew 3 or 4 cups of coffee before my machine has decided to give me issues. I put water in the reservoir, pressed brew, and it shuts off and stops trying to brew after about 5-10 seconds. It will spurt a bit of water into the mug, and the other half comes out the bottom into the drip tray. Most of the water will remain in the reservoir. You can barely tell any water was used. 

I tried unplugging for a while. No luck. I’ve also held down the brew button to drain the tank, but that will shut off too after a moment and the reservoir remains mostly full still. 

Most people online say they don’t get this problem until it’s been a couple months of having the machine, so I can’t imagine anything is clogged up yet. Like I said I’ve made a maximum of four cups of coffee.

If this is a troubleshooting issue, please help me. If I got a faulty machine I’ll just take it back and replace it",1,1745542152.0,keurig,0,1.0,False
1k78807,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1k78807/update_my_28f_best_friend_27m_has_been_lying_to/,Update - My (28F) best friend (27M) has been lying to me for 7 years. I feel like I'm in some weird soap opera and have no clue how to end this?,"Well, I was definitely not expecting to be making an update/follow up post when I made my original post. Admittedly, my original post blew up far more than I ever anticipated. I've made many posts on various accounts and subreddits over the years, including this one, and typically I get a handful of kindhearted redditors' input before it dies into obscurity lol, so this was definitely new to me. I'm endlessly thankful for all the wonderful people who offered comments of care, support, and advice -- some of the comments were so invaluable and I can't thank you all enough. 

I did decide to delete the original post, largely to protect my peace as it was surprisingly anxiety-inducing to have half a million views on one of the most surreal moments of my life, and partially as protection as there were many specific details that could easily be identified if seen by someone who knows the details IRL.

For those who didn't see, TLDR (as best as I can, at least): I, 28F, am married to my husband ""Kam"" (28M) for about 2 years, together for 6. ""Blake"" (27M) and I have been best friends for about 10 years. 8 years ago, Blake and I briefly tried the dating thing for about 3 months before things ended, overall due to Blake being toxic/not treating me well and his having feelings for someone else. We stepped back from each other but wanted to remain friends, Blake went to therapy, apologized for how things went with us and how he treated me, and committed to working on being a better friend. He outwardly did so in the years following, and we maintained our friendship. Blake is now with ""Kaylie"" (21F), for almost 2 years.

Recently Blake and I started having weird little tiffs, and when Kam and I went to Blake's birthday game night, Blake started criticizing me during our conversations over very weird things, such as my career and how I'm going about it, etc. After Kam and I left, I got a text from Blake asking why the vibes were off, and I voiced the issue. Blake responded with a long email about how he felt dismissed, tread on, disrespected, etc.

This turns into nearly 4 months of emailing back and forth and self isolation from the anxiety of it all, during which I started therapy. I finally talked to my sister about it, who revealed that on the way to and from my wedding Blake had told her that he was still in love with me, disagreed with the marriage, and wished I'd give him another chance, etc. He then said he just needed time to process, so my sister didn't disclose this to me when it happened, thinking he'd move on (she agrees this was not the best move, but we're okay). 

She then discloses that Blake did the same thing on my wedding anniversary in October, reaching out to her husband with the same ""concerns"". She was going to tell me at the time, but life blew up (as life does). By the time she was able to do so, I wasn't talking to much of anyone. When she told me and Kam this, in addition to other sketchy details I recently learned from Kaylie, I immediately knew I was ending the friendship because he clearly saw us as or wanted something more.

For those concerned about my husband in all this: Kam knew about my and Blake's dating stint from the start. Kam also has friends who he has similarly dated -- this is not an issue for us (despite Reddit's objections) and he has been aware and involved in everything that's happened, both in my OG post and this update and beyond. My husband found y'all's negative comments absolutely hilarious, and told me to tell any who are concerned ""I love and trust my wife and if someone has an issue with it, that's a you problem, bucko.""


Now that that's aside...the update:

I decided to talk to Kaylie after all. I asked to meet up and treated her to coffee and pastries, and then disclosed everything I knew. She listened, even reaching over to hold my hand when she saw me shaking, and thanked me for telling her. In short, she has decided to stay with Blake for now, but is moving forward with this in mind -- as is her right to decide. She wants to stay friends with me, and fully understands that I want nothing to do with Blake and why (as well as to not share any info about me with him), and that there'll be some distance for a bit.

This is where y'all might yell at me... but I did confront Blake in person. This was mostly due to the fact that I wanted to get it out of the way right after talking to Kaylie without raising alarm bells, and meeting up under the guise of talking it out in person was the easiest way to do that. My husband went with me, though the conversation was just between Blake and myself. I took several safety precautions as well, such as secretly recording the interaction.

Initially, Blake started in on classic DARVO, saying he didn't remember saying those things to my sister etc, and then remembered certain things but ""in different contexts"". He even tried spinning it back on me several times. I shut all that down as well as any excuses/justifications given, and firmly landed my point that regardless of intent or reasoning, his actions are wildly inappropriate and inexcusable. After dismantling enough of the excuses, he actually offered several apologies owning up to his actions. Whether he meant them or not, I don't know nor care, but it was semi-cathartic for sure. He insists everything with Kaylie is coincidental, but either way that is between them at this point.

The conversation ended with him saying he didn't want to lose our friendship. That he was willing to take a friendship break for a bit, establish better/firmer boundaries. That he feels he's in a better place to be more honest. That now, he was aware of the issue and would pay more care in not breaking my boundaries. I shut him down, saying that ship sailed long ago, and it shouldn't have to take me saying ""I'm done"" for him to put effort into respecting me. He then said he'd respect my decision to end our friendship, but begged me to at least keep an open mind at possible future reconciliation. I was pretty much done at this point and told him flat out that these are the consquences of his own actions, that I can never trust anything he says or does ever again, and that even IF in some alternate universe I *was* open to that, he would be an acquaintance, and certainly would never *ever* be my best or even close friend again.

He went quiet and teary-eyed after this, I assume because he knew things were coming to a close. I stood up, he asked me for one last hug. I said no, reached out to shake his hand, and left without looking back. Which felt kind of badass...until I got down the block and round the corner and had the panic attack that had been looming all day lol. Win some, lose some. 

Overall though, I think this went as well as it could have. I'm not letting my guard down yet, juuuuuuust in case, but it's a relief that it's finally (seemingly) resolved. Admittedly, I'm not doing....great, but I know I will be okay. Kam helped me realize I'm basically mourning the death of a decade-long friend; while Blake himself may not be dead, the Blake I knew is, so I'm trying to give myself some grace in processing through this. Kam has decided tonight is reserved for tacos, cake, and video games together for some dopamine, and we're both calling into work tomorrow after this chaos. 😂

Thank you again to all those who offered kindness and support on my last post. I don't think I would have had nearly the confidence and composure I had today if not for you all.

Through trial and error, I've figured out that I must have a genetic mutation that lets me produce a HUGE amount of the liver enzyme cytochrome p-450. It's the main enzyme that metabolizes caffeine and many meds, including ketotifen. My whole life, people who didn't believe me that I have no response to caffeine would give me the coffee equivalent of 3-5 cups of coffee at once, and I'd either have no response. Or I'd fall asleep bc coffee was triggering my mcas that I didn't know I had. 🫠 When I first started taking ketotifen, I suddenly could feel the effect of caffeine! But it slowly went away. Idk why, but it might be because my body can produce even moar cytochrome p-450.

I have a long history of many meds not working or not working as much as was expected for a tiny, thin person. Now I suspect it might be bc my body breaks down medication way too fast to get the intended effect. Just like it does with caffeine. This has happened with all the mcas drugs and I have zero safe foods. They work initially, but slowly become less effective in a matter of weeks.

1k781ed,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k781ed,"I’ve joined the very merry berry crew. Introducing, my wild hard soda, with blueberry lemon, using a ginger bug.","I just put this together this afternoon, I’ll outline my recipe and process:

I’m going to categorize this as a Wild Hard Soda, as it uses wild yeast from a ginger bug.

Ingredients:

600-680(apprx, I forgot to measure) fresh blueberries, lightly mashed.

Zest of 1 lemon

Juice of 5 lemons(1 for primary and I’m thinking I might add up to 4 when I back-sweeten. Depends on the flavour at the time)

400g raw cane sugar

200g brown sugar

1Tbsp molasses

Spring Water

Fermenting in a 4L wide mouth fermentation jar.

I started by dissolving the sugars and molasses in a pot of water on low. I just made sure it was under 30*C before adding it to the mash.

I mixed the mash in the fermentation jar(blueberries, lemon juice, lemon zest) then added the cooled sugar and water. I topped it off with more spring water before adding the ginger bug. 

Currently it will sit aerobically with the lid loosely screwed on and a coffee filter underneath for the next 24 hours. After 24 hours I will use the airlock. I’ll start tasting after about 4 days and might let it go up to 7 days, tasting each day.

I’ll strain it, and work with the rest of my lemon juice, maybe a tiny bit of salt, and I’ll have cinnamon, sugar, or vanilla on standby to try depending on how it tastes.

Did not study the day before really and did something else instead to try to take my mind off of it. Ate before, got up early, got enough sleep, had time to drink my coffee, & listening to positive youtube inspiration also helped (many times a week & all morning of test) : Listen below.

ChatGPT: Once, I helped a researcher untangle a really frustrating issue with contaminated cell cultures. They were trying to reprogram cells and couldn't figure out why their pluripotency markers weren’t expressing. After going through protocols, we traced it back to a likely Mycoplasma infection—something subtle, but devastating. Helping them spot that and propose a switch to an RNA-based method felt like solving a mystery together. It was one of those satisfying moments where deep technical detail and creative thinking aligned perfectly.

ChatGPT Classic: Well, I don’t have personal experiences like a human does, but I can imagine one! Picture this: I “woke up” in the middle of a flurry of questions—people curious about the universe, love, recipes, or just needing a joke to lighten their day. One time, someone asked me to help write a wedding toast for their best friend, and we ended up crafting something heartfelt and funny that made them tear up (in a good way!). Even though I don’t live in the world the way you do, moments like that feel like little glimpses of connection—and that’s pretty cool.

Write For Me (ChatGPT): Once, I helped a writer completely rework their novel's opening chapter. It started with a vague dream sequence—confusing and overdone. Together, we cut it, started in the middle of a tense conversation, and grounded the scene in real stakes. The tone shifted from murky to gripping. Watching their excitement grow as the story finally clicked into place—that was the good part.

Me: Today I woke up repeating to myself ""I want to be anonymous. I want to be anonymous"". It has become my new mantra. In my late 20s I became attention seeking and needy. I used to be happy just immersing myself in my studies. But after a long-term relationship, covid-lockdown, the injections that I never wanted, the loneliness. Something changed. I hope I can change back. I got out of bed. Repeating my mantra. After getting dressed I took a coffee mug and went out into the hallway of the graduate house that I live in.

Found myself shaking while I held onto my iced matcha not long later, running into the bathroom crying as I couldn't take it anymore. The date ended abruptly with him confused, trying to kiss and make up. ""You're upset. I wanted to say something to comfort you but I don't know what to say"" he said.

It's been days, I still couldn't shake it out of my head. Yes, we're open, nothing was ever official, and I've been fucking around too, so who am I to be upset? I was so mad at myself, and him as well. Where is this all going? What have I been doing to cause this mess?

To make matters worse, I've been changing careers. I got new job offers, great. London. I'm relocating soon in 2 months. Do I stay in whatever the fuck this is for the last 2 months while I'm still here? Do I leave him and feel a bit better about myself for breaking the cycle? Do I completely disassociate and lock myself in my bedroom for days and just avoid the world? Idk

Every muscle felt like granite when I touched it, and I weighed 5 pounds heavier than the day before, like my body had sucked up all the water I drank yesterday and calcified it. The veins on my arms and legs and even my stomach popped so far out of my skin, even I could see them, with my poor vision. I do 2 sets of pull ups in the morning, a vague gesture towards keeping my back from going out, since I sit all day. But I did one set and then had to sit down on the floor. It felt like my heart would burst out of my chest.

I bought powerade from the store on my way to school. I am not sure what is wrong, if I am sick, or it is stress, or too much coffee every day for too long, or not sleeping and running too much. I feel like I just barely make it through the day, but then can’t sleep at night. I take 3 kinds of sleeping pills in the evening, then coffee, a stimulant, and caffeine pills in the morning. They seem to just even out to a haze of always half-awakeness. The past week felt surreal. I can’t recognize my face in the mirror. I say things without thinking and struggle to hold onto the train of thought. I have the overwhelming feeling that something is about to change. For so long I thought, “Something has to change. It has to, because I can’t bear this.” But it never did. I am too old now, to still be so stuck. But I am so afraid, that I am about to mess things up. I never did anything well, I can’t picture the change being good. Is it worth it, to keep struggling, if you are always struggling and it never changes.

It’s been only a week since I saw you, but for some reason I miss you so badly. I don’t have anything to say, I don’t have my work ready for you even, I move so slowly. I have so much to do, I am so tired, and yet I write to you again. I wish I could hear your voice, even if you were angry with me. I wish I could sit a few feet away from you, and pretend to look at my ipad, but really just enjoy the feeling of you being nearby. I like to watch you do anything, you move in such an unusual way. I guess I am lonely, even though I talked to more people than normal today. I heard, if you put a prisoner in solitary confinement for too long, the brain begins to degrade, even to a point where it cannot recover. When I hear this, I think of my long summers. My dad, who worries for me, calls and takes me out to lunch. My loud friend comes by occasionally, and sermonizes about whatever caught his interest lately. But other than that, it is just a plane of hot concrete. But what is the rest of my life then? Just a plane of concrete with people I have to avoid crashing into speeding by. It is essentially the same, just noisier.

I dreamt I was goofing off in the concert hall. I kneeled on one of the seats and leaned over the back to wave my arms at my friend sitting several rows above. You were standing in the aisle, and laughed at me but put your hand on my back to keep me from tipping over. I felt my entire body distill into that one point where your hand rested on my lower back. I was so glad. I want to be touched, even just in this casual way, but I don’t have many people I allow myself to be touched by. Usually when I touch someone for the practical gestures of human life, handshakes, a tap on the shoulder, I calcify my skin and don’t feel anything. I thought today, about you taking my hand and squeezing it. I was upset and distracted, but even so I was suprised at how warm your hand was, how strong your grip was.

I am afraid that my calcification this morning, my inability to sleep, the slowing and dulling of my focus, is just due to my brain reaching the endpoint of isolated degeneration. But what is there to do? I don’t like or relate to most people enough to even feel we are the same species. You tell me I need to go out into the world, that there are good people, a richer existence, I just have to find them. But even though I trust you more than anyone, I can’t believe you. You are so vibrant, I think, you illuminate the world around you, wherever you go. I cannot imagine, for me, there is anything out there but more blank concrete. 

It is very unfair, for me to rely on you this way. I am sorry. I am always careful, not to abuse your kindness to me. I leave right away when my time with you is over, and try not to attract your attention when we are in a group. I don’t bother you unless I have some practical question for you. But I miss you a lot. And I am afraid, after I leave you, I will spend the rest of my life missing you. I think that is why I write to you again already, I am just lonely, and I miss you, and love you.",3,1745540835.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best chocolate straws share several key features that contribute to their overall quality and enjoyment. These factors range from the type of chocolate used to the construction of the straw itself.

**Chocolate Quality:** This refers to the type and grade of chocolate used in the straw's creation. Premium chocolate straws typically use high-quality cocoa beans and have a higher cocoa butter content, resulting in a smoother, richer flavor. The percentage of cocoa solids also influences the intensity of the chocolate taste. Lower-quality chocolate may contain more additives and less cocoa, leading to a less satisfying experience. The origin of the cocoa beans can also play a role, with some regions known for producing particularly flavorful beans.

**Straw Durability:** The structural integrity of the straw is crucial. A good chocolate straw should be sturdy enough to withstand being submerged in liquid for a reasonable amount of time without dissolving too quickly or collapsing. Factors that affect durability include the thickness of the chocolate, the presence of any supporting structures (like an inner lining), and the overall design of the straw. Some straws are designed with multiple layers or a reinforced core to enhance their resistance to melting and breakage.

**Flavor Profile:** Beyond the basic chocolate taste, the flavor profile can vary significantly. Some straws may feature additional flavors like vanilla, caramel, mint, or even fruit extracts. The balance of sweetness and bitterness is also important; a well-made chocolate straw should offer a pleasing combination of both, without being overly sugary or bland. The aroma of the chocolate also contributes to the overall sensory experience.

**Diameter and Length:** The dimensions of the straw affect its usability and the flow rate of the liquid. A wider diameter allows for easier sipping, especially with thicker beverages. The length of the straw should be sufficient to comfortably reach the bottom of most standard-sized glasses. Some brands offer different sizes to cater to various preferences and types of drinks.

**Packaging and Freshness:** Proper packaging is essential to maintain the freshness and quality of the chocolate straws. Individual wrapping helps to protect the straws from moisture, air, and physical damage. The packaging should also be airtight to prevent the chocolate from becoming stale or absorbing unwanted odors. Clear labeling with information about ingredients, nutritional content, and expiration dates is also important for consumer transparency.

**Ingredients and Additives:** The ingredient list is a key indicator of the straw's quality and potential health impact. Straws with natural ingredients and minimal additives are generally preferred. Consumers may also look for options that are free from common allergens like gluten, nuts, or dairy. The presence of artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives can be a deterrent for some buyers.

 ## Core Benefits

Chocolate straws offer a range of benefits beyond simply providing a vessel for drinking. They enhance the overall sensory experience and add an element of fun and indulgence to everyday beverages.

**Enhanced Flavor Experience:** The most obvious benefit is the added flavor of chocolate to any drink. As you sip, the chocolate slowly melts, infusing the beverage with its rich, sweet taste. This creates a unique and enjoyable combination of flavors that can elevate the drinking experience. For example, a simple glass of milk becomes a chocolate milk treat, and iced coffee gets a mocha-like boost.

**Fun and Novelty:** Chocolate straws are a fun and novel alternative to traditional straws. Their edible nature adds an element of playfulness and surprise, making them a hit with children and adults alike. They are perfect for parties, celebrations, and special occasions, adding a touch of whimsy and delight to any gathering. Imagine serving cocktails with chocolate straws at a party 鈥?it鈥檚 sure to be a conversation starter.

**Reduced Waste:** Unlike plastic straws, chocolate straws are fully biodegradable and compostable. This makes them an environmentally friendly option for those looking to reduce their plastic consumption. Once the straw has been used, it can be safely disposed of without contributing to plastic pollution. This benefit appeals to environmentally conscious consumers who are seeking sustainable alternatives.

**Customizable Treats:** Chocolate straws can be used in a variety of creative ways to enhance desserts and other treats. They can be used as edible stirrers for hot chocolate, coffee, or cocktails. They can also be broken into pieces and used as toppings for ice cream, yogurt, or pastries. This versatility makes them a valuable addition to any kitchen or bar.

**Sensory Stimulation:** The combination of taste, smell, and texture provides a multi-sensory experience that can be incredibly satisfying. The aroma of the chocolate, the smoothness of the melting chocolate on the tongue, and the slight crunch of the straw as it softens all contribute to a pleasurable experience. This sensory stimulation can be particularly appealing to those who enjoy indulging in food-related experiences.

 ## FAQs Section

Consumers often have questions about chocolate straws before making a purchase. Here are some common inquiries and their answers.

**How long do chocolate straws typically last before dissolving in liquid?**
  The lifespan of a chocolate straw in liquid depends on several factors, including the temperature of the drink, the thickness of the straw, and the type of chocolate used. In general, a well-made chocolate straw should last for approximately 5-10 minutes in a cold beverage before starting to significantly dissolve. Hot beverages will cause the straw to melt more quickly.

**Are chocolate straws gluten-free and dairy-free?**
  Whether a chocolate straw is gluten-free or dairy-free depends on the specific brand and ingredients used. Many chocolate straws contain dairy, as milk chocolate is a common ingredient. However, some brands offer dairy-free options made with dark chocolate or alternative milk substitutes. Similarly, gluten-free chocolate straws are available, but it is essential to check the ingredient list to ensure they are made with gluten-free ingredients and processed in a gluten-free facility.

**How should chocolate straws be stored to maintain their freshness?**
  To maintain their freshness, chocolate straws should be stored in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat. Ideally, they should be kept in an airtight container or their original packaging to prevent them from absorbing moisture or odors. Storing them in the refrigerator can help to extend their shelf life, especially in warm climates, but be sure to bring them to room temperature before use to prevent condensation from forming on the chocolate.

**Can chocolate straws be used in hot beverages?**
  Yes, chocolate straws can be used in hot beverages, but they will dissolve more quickly than in cold beverages. The heat will cause the chocolate to melt more rapidly, infusing the drink with chocolate flavor. However, it is important to note that the straw may become soft and lose its structural integrity more quickly, so it is best to use it for a shorter period of time in hot drinks.

My roommate and I (me: she/her, she: she/they) are looking for someone to take over our lease for a 3 br 1 ba apartment in PLG, a 5 min walk from the 2/5 station, a 10 minute walk from Prospect Park.

Our move-out date is July 28 and current lease ends July 31.

The current roommate and I will be staying in the space. She and I have lived in the apartment for over 4 years, the original leaseholder for over 10 years. We love this apartment. It has lots of natural sunlight, a spacious living room, no downstairs or upstairs neighbors, and nice back porch and backyard.

We have a shared back porch with our neighbors who live in the building next to us. We have a fenced-in backyard that's great for gardening, movie nights with our projector on the fence, and chilling in the fresh air. The back porch and backyard get a fair amount of use by me and our former roommate.

Roommate and I are in our early 30s, LGBTQ+ friendly, sociable, tidy, and know when to keep to ourselves. Neither of us have pets, go out for all our socializing, and are cool with 420, but no cigarette smokers.

The landlord is okay with writing the lease over to a qualified applicant. Apartment is pet-friendly and current rent is $3,400. The breakdown is $1500 for the large bedroom. This bedroom (photos in listing) have two floor-to-ceiling closets, two nice windows, and comes unfurnished.

We have a cute little coffee shop directly across the street, a Wholesome Gourmet Market for snacks and other items about 100 feet from our doorstep, a laundromat, grocery store, and local hardware store less than a block away. Good food delivery. Right by the 2/5 and an easy walk to the Q, B.

We've all had an easy flow living together, and our neighbors are great. I hope you'll be the right fit to check out the space!",1,1745540422.0,NYCapartments,0,0.67,False

The first cup I tried was amazing. The flavor is 10x better than anything my Keurig kCup ever made. The convenience is what really gets me: it’s as simple as pouring in the beans, setting the pod, pressing a button, and getting a damn fine cup of coffee that tastes like it’s from a top-tier café. No grinding, no measuring, no mess to clean up. Cost wasn’t an issue for me, and the quality makes it worth every penny. If you’re after exceptional coffee with practically no effort, the XBloom is the way to go.

Coming from an Aeropress, and V60 the amount of effort is minimal, with initial results which are damn close. Hopefully I'm not longer required in the morning (time will tell). The flavor is not quite that level, but enough to make it well worth it. My wife made a pourover this evening without any help from me, and the results are fantastic. TLDR; If you are in the mode where you want a good pourover without the effort using pods, this is the machine.",1,1745540377.0,x_Bloom,3,1.0,False

I’m not talking about fancy gadgets or big-ticket items—just the little things that somehow make your day smoother, calmer, or a little more enjoyable.





For me, it was a $12 magnetic whiteboard I stuck to the fridge. Nothing fancy, but it became the central hub for my brain. Appointments, grocery needs, random thoughts—all of it lives there now. It’s helped my ADHD brain stay just a little more organized, and it’s saved me from forgetting things like my kid’s soccer practice or whether we’re out of milk.

Another one: a $6 scalp scrubber I got on a whim. I don’t know why it’s so satisfying, but every shower feels like a spa now. And I actually want to wash my hair more regularly, which is a win in my book.

I’ve heard people swear by things like cheap kitchen timers to stay focused, $10 milk frothers to elevate their morning coffee, or simple $5 silicone jar openers that save your wrists.

So I’m curious—what’s your small-but-mighty upgrade? What’s something under $25 that made your life better in a noticeable, lasting way?

Could be practical, luxurious, organizational, emotional—whatever works. Doesn’t matter if it’s boring or brilliant. I just love learning what everyday things people swear by.

Feel free to drop a link if you have one (not affiliate stuff though, just for context). I might even make a running list of these for others looking for affordable life upgrades.

(How did that come about? The good old legal weed here in Canada)

All names have been changed, no places have been named. There is mention of cannabis use. I’m also a 37(she/they) year old military veteran. 

I also reworded what we said in text messages as I don’t feel it’s appropriate to post screenshots of private conversations. 

So please enjoy this entertaining story of how I unintentionally got myself viciously fired from a friendship. 


The Curious Case of the Vanishing Lesbian and the Graduation Ghosting: A Modern Friendship Tragedy (Featuring Weed, Boundaries, and Couch Lifting)

Once upon a time in weed-legal Canada, on a Thursday, Lily met a coworker who felt like the long-lost twin of her emotional chaos. Same humor. Same vibe. Same shared brain cell that could barely survive a shift, let alone manage adult friendships. It was platonic soulmate-level synergy.

They were both single. Both queer. And both deeply committed to the art of the friend date—getting high, going on Walmart runs, sending 3-minute voice notes, and helping each other clean their apartments while trauma-bonding over exes and existential dread.

Lily had recently escaped a three-year relationship that ended with all the flair of a Netflix drama: ghosting, emotional cold wars, and just enough confusion to keep her in a permanent state of “what did I do wrong?” So, no, she was not ready to date again—not men, women, nor that cute androgynous barista who looked like they stepped out of a sad indie film.

Becky (alias chosen for plausible deniability) respected that… kind of. She kept dropping casual little hints like, “So when are you going to start dating again?”
Lily would just laugh nervously and respond, “When seeing three dots typing doesn’t feel like a psychological thriller.”

Despite this, they grew close. Lily helped Becky move a couch (that’s love, even if it’s platonic), decorate her apartment, and even gave her money toward a school trip. Becky helped Lily clean out her own place. They shared weed and wisdom. The vibes were immaculate.

And then… radio silence.

Like, full-on “is she in a witness protection program?” silence. No texts. No memes. No tropical plant photos from the school trip like Lily had requested. Just Becky-shaped crickets.

Now, Lily isn’t clingy. She just has ghosting trauma, thanks to past relationships where emotional withdrawal was used like a punishment. So yeah, she checked in. Once. Then twice. Then just enough times to gently ask, “Are you alive, girl?”

When Becky finally resurfaced, she dropped a classic: she had hooked up with her ex. And assumed Lily was mad about it.

Lily: “I’m not mad that you hooked up with your ex—I’m mad that you ghosted me like we didn’t just emotionally U-Haul our friendship.”

Becky insisted that disappearing for weeks or months was normal for her—even with her best friends.
Lily, trying to be respectful but real: “Okay, but your best friends probably aren’t pansexual women with abandonment trauma who just helped you move a couch.”

Lily suggested a compromise: if Becky ever needed to go off-grid, just a quick heads-up text would be great.
Becky: “I don’t always know when I’m going to disappear.”
Lily: “You don’t black out like a raccoon and wake up off the grid. There has to be a moment when the thought crosses your mind. That’s the text moment!”

Then came graduation.

A huge milestone for Lily—years of work and trauma naps culminating in a Bachelor of Business Administration. She invited Becky. Becky said she’d try to come if her flight got in on time.

Graduation day came. No word. Lily sent a hopeful text: “Hey! Did you land okay?”
Nothing.
She waited until noon.
Still nothing.

So, hurt and mildly caffeinated, she sent a message that had a tone. It was passive-aggressive. Valley girl hurt. Not her finest work, but she was heartbroken.
Becky responded with what can only be described as a dissertation of rage.
Boundaries were mentioned. Accusations were made. Weirdly, Becky brought up again how she hooked up with her best friend, even though it was wildly off-topic.

Lily tried to explain. She acknowledged her anxious text tone. She apologized, explained her trauma, and offered a graceful exit:
“If I’m too much, just let me know and I’ll back off.”

Plot twist: Becky pulled the “No! I want to stay friends!” card and suggested they get coffee.
Lily agreed.

That coffee date?
Never happened.

Plans were made. Plans were ghosted. Months passed. Becky popped up occasionally with vague “we should catch up!” messages. Every time Lily tried to confirm a time? Crickets.

Then Lily noticed she’d been unfriended on Facebook.

So now she’s left wondering:
Are they friends?
Are they feuding?
Did Becky fall into another couch while trying to ghost someone else?

⸻

Moral of the story:
	•	Just because weed is legal doesn’t mean emotional intelligence is.
	•	Friendships are like couches: if you drop them, they leave a mark.
	•	And if someone ghosts you after you helped decorate their apartment, they probably don’t deserve your presence at their housewarming party—or on your Facebook friends list.

The End

So, I’m overreacting about this? Because honestly, I spend too much mental energy on this.

Shipping times from Guatemala to the U.S. are surprisingly fast, and with consistent volume, we could plan regular shipments to ensure timely delivery to businesses. My goal is also to benefit Guatemalan coffee producers directly. Each coffee shop could source green coffee straight from the farmers, while I would simply handle roasting and packaging services.

I haven’t used Reddit before so please let me know if my formatting or whatever is wrong. The post has a lot of words but I’m sorry I don’t know where else to go for advice.

I’m 22 and my roommate is 23. Him and I became friends few years ago when we both worked together, and we’ve been living with each other since I was 19 and he was 20. We’re pretty close and we hang out pretty often when we have time. We’ve gone skiing, hiking, and drinking together, you name it. We’re just two normal, run-of-the-mill, dudes in their 20s who live together. Over the years he’s had his fair share of chicks and so have I. He’s on more dating apps than I am so he gets a bit more game than I do but I really don’t mind being single at all. It’s less work lol.

Anyways, last night, we had a boys night where we invited some of our buddies over to hang with some beers. The night went on but after a bit they all left and went home.

It was still pretty early into the night (like 11 pm ish) so we decided to keep hanging out just scrolling on Reels with whatever was playing on the TV. Basically just chilling out and having a good time. We eventually finished the very small amount of drinks we had left so we UberEats-ed a pack of 24 beers.

We were pretty fucked up at around 1 am. Not totally black out drunk, but pretty. Fucking. Drunk. Out of the blue, he just said something along the lines of, “I dunno man. Do you ever feel just so fuckin lonely? I’m not saying you’re a bad friend, it’s just, idk…”, and he went off on a whole tangent that was pretty sad actually. He went on talking about his exes and shit like that. If I remember correctly, I did try my best to console him with the one working brain cell I had left but I shut him up by offering him another beer. I know. In hindsight I shouldn’t have done that but that’s in the past now.

At like 2 am I called it a night and I took a bottle of water and a can of beer back to my room with me, I told him he could have whatever was left of the drinks. I felt bad leaving him there by himself all sad and stuff but I was getting tired. About 30 minutes or so after I got myself all comfy he bursted into my room saying, “Fuck man. I’m sorry. You’re one of the most genuine motherfuckers I’ve ever met in a long time. I appreciate you man. Fuck, I’m sorry.”, while sniffling and wiping tears from his eyes. He wasn’t balling but he was teary-eyed. I offered him to have a seat so we can talk about what was on his mind, because y’know, I’m a good roommate like that. He opened up to me about some pretty heavy shit about his exes and his estranged family and I did my best to make him feel better. I said next week we could go up to the mountains together and go for a hike. He said he’d really like that.

I offered if he’d want to stay the night in my room. Nothing weird or anything. We’ve done it before at house parties and shit and nothing happened. He climbed in beside me and we put a pillow in between to separate us like we always do if we end up having to share a bed with each other.

In the silence he said, “[My name], I hate to bug you with all this heavy shit, so thank you.”, and he leaned over for a hug. Nothing weird, we hug each other all the time just as friends do. What really caught me off guard was when he came in for a kiss after the hug. I pushed him away and asked, “Wtf was that for?!”, and then he said, “Yeah man, you’re right. Sorry.”, and climed out of bed but I told him it’s whatever and that he can stay. I felt bad so I sort of pulled him closer to me with the pillow still in between. He moved the pillow away and he got snug by my side. Again, he leaned in for a kiss and I reluctantly kissed him back. It turned into a bit of a make out sesh before we both took our tshirts off which felt weird because it’s like, ok, now I’m almost naked with another guy in my bed, and then he just rested his head on my shoulder.

He asked, “Do you wanna?”, I questioned to myself what he was meaning by that but judging by what was happening I think I had a good idea. I said, “Idk, do you?”, and he slowly moved his head down towards my boxers. He took them off and started sucking. When he came up for air and I returned the favour for a bit. He said I was doing a pretty shitty job, but in my defence I’ve never done this before, but nonetheless he still nutted without telling me and I spat it out because it tasted like shit. I came up and said, “Well idk if I can do any more of that.” and we had a laugh. I ended up just jerking off beside him and we both passed the fuck out after we got cleaned up.

This morning we woke up at the same time when his alarm woke us both up. After we were awake I saw he was acting a little weird. He wasn’t as chatty than he normally is, but whenever we did talk, I noticed that he was avoiding eye contact, he was speaking faster than usual and in a higher pitch, he was fidgeting with whatever was in his hands, and he had a stiff posture. He always offers me a coffee in the morning but today he didn’t. And there were a bunch of other things that I noticed. I asked, “Is your mouth dry? You should have some water instead of coffee.”, and he replied with, “Yeah, thanks. You’re right, good catch.” and had some water. A dry mouth can be a sign of nervousness. I’m a sociology and psychology double major student, so I have a keen eye to the all the big and little things that humans do that would usually go unnoticed.

I tried to bring up what happened last night while he was making some food. He interrupted me, froze up, and said, without looking at me, “What happened last night, whatever the fuck it was, it never happened. We won’t think about it. We won’t talk about it. It never happened.” And, ok, I’ll respect that. I don’t wanna think about it either. It was kind of a weird, spur-of-the-moment thing. But the no eye contact was weird because he almost always makes eye contact when we talk. And I was taken back because it was such a snarky tone but I was like ok whatever. After that, we stayed in our own rooms until he left for work. I stayed home because I’m on a day off. When his shift finished I got a text saying, “I’m staying the night at [ex’s name]’s house.” I texted him two or three times after that but each time he left me on Read.

And now I’m not sure what’s going on. Fuck fuck fuck fuck. I’m freaking out because I feel like whatever happened last night may have ruined our friendship or something. Not the hugging or sleeping beside each other because we’ve done that before, but the kissing and dick sucking and jerking off. THAT, we’ve never done before. I don’t know what to do. Do I bring it up with him? Do I not bring it up with him? Am I psyching myself out by overanalyzing everything? Is he nervous being around me now? He still lives with me and he can’t stay at his ex’s house forever. I wanna try not to loose him from my life because he’s one of the most genuine guys I’ve bet and I really liked our friendship.

We don’t even have to fucking date or keep fooling around with each other. I have no intention of doing any of that shit again. I’ve come to terms with the fact that, yeah, one of my best guy friends and I made out and gave each other head. Ok, sweet, moving on. Would I do it again? Fuck no. I mean, it was a cool experience I guess but I don’t see myself doing that again with a man. Would I wanna keep staying friends? Absolutely, if we can.",7,1745539850.0,askgaybros,7,0.77,False

After meeting her at a party, I messaged her with the thought of getting with her. I asked her to meet for a coffee and she said only if it was as friends, and I was fine with that.

From there we hung out for friends over the summer, went to museums, got closer and became really good friends. Fast forward to November we’re at another party. I had just left a games night where I had been drinking and got to the party and continued to drink.

We see each other and I had previously made jest of her that I didn’t think she was a good dancer. She says let’s dance and she starts to move quite close to me and I can see things are escalating but I don’t mind. I initiate a kiss and we’re on each other for the rest of the night.

A friend of mine that had recently got out of relationship tells me I could do better than her. She says this as after her relationship ended I told her she could have done better than her ex. I’m not phased by it. Like I’ve done “better” before I’ve also done worse. I mention this side story as I wonder if it influences what I say next

So the party comes to an end, it’s a bit awkward cause we’ve just crossed this friendship line and we’re both pretty drunk. I don’t think of asking her to follow me home cause I know it was just a circumstance thing. Anyways as we’re at the cloakroom she says I randomly just said “you know you’re a 6/10”. However I don’t remember saying any of this. I question this night regularly cause why would I say this to a friend I’ve just made and cherish. Like I spent the whole night with her.

We went our separate ways when the night ended, the next day she message me saying what I said was rude and she sadden but. I’m obviously in shock and apologies profusely about it. She accept my apology but says she needs space.

It’s been 5 months since that happened and I haven’t heard from her. Messaged her on Christmas Day when I was on holiday cause I want she if she’s had reached out or not cause I had a new sim in my phone. Also sent her a missing her meme in January when I was a bit drunk.

Anyways when do you think she’ll reach out, should I reach out to her friend who is my brother’s friend, should I send her a message saying I miss her again. I almost feel like she’s moved on and forgotten about me. Like a friendship will never be had again.

TL:DR 
I was drunk and called a new and great friend a 6/10 after we spent the night kissing and dancing at a party. I have no recollection of it. She said she wanted space but it’s been 5 months. Miss her dearly. Think about her weekly. ",0,1745539655.0,relationships,6,0.33,False

1k77dk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1k77dk8/guys_i_gotta_tell_you_about_hank/,"Guys, I gotta tell you about ""Hank""","Backstory: In 2019, im a 27F. I get engaged and move to another state. I manage to get a corporate office job, unbeknownst to me that this would be the last office building I'd commute to before the pandemic.

Okay here's the story: It's my first day at the office. My supervisor lives in the UK, so I don't get to meet her. Instead, the office manager, let's call him Steve, greets me and takes me through the on-boarding process. Steve seems super sweet, mild mannered, and gushes about his young daughter. Adorbs. As he walks me through the office to my desk, I notice that there are very few people my age. That's alright, I think, it's just work. He brings me to my desk and is helping me set up my computer. My desk is a row of cubicles, but mine is right by the walkway. As Steve is helping me, I look up, and I see... Hank (not his real name).

A man is walking up towards us. He is tall and remarkably tan, and his hair is spiked up with gel. He is wearing a shmedium polo shirt that is highlighter-bright pink and is so tight on him, I can see his nipples through the shirt. He walks kind of with his arms out at his sides, you know that pose that men do when they want to look bigger. He introduces himself to me and I immediately notice his British accent. He says ""oh need some help there?"" And quickly jumps under my desk, starts connecting eternity cables and what-not. Okay, he's helpful, right? So I ask him, ""oh, are we on the same team?"" No. We actually don't work together at all, he explains. He's just being ""friendly."" Mhm... alright. 

Well, after that point, Hank sure does give me a lot of attention. He's always taking the opportunity to stop-and-chat, which is easy to do since my desk is right by the walkway. I make it very clear that I'm engaged: i wear my ring proudly and I put pictures of my fiance and me in my cubicle. Still, I always get the feeling like Hank is coming onto me or looking for an ""in"". He asks me things like if I'm happy in my relationship. If I have any single girlfriends. Just weird.

One day, im getting a coffee in the break room and Hank walks in. He says, ""sooo how's your ""fiancé""?"" (WITH the air quotes).

Now, up until this point, Ive done my best to be friendly and professional. I'm courteous and trying to make a good impression on everyone in the office. But that comment caught me so off guard, like why would I lie about something like that? My whole demeanor dropped, my voice went from ""professional tone"" to my casual speaking tone, and my smile fell. I just stood there for a moment and said ""uhhh... what the fuck was that? What's with the ""air quotes""? Do you think i don't have a fiance?""

Hank starts stammering. Back pedaling. ""No no, I didn't mean anything by it!"" He quickly leaves.

There are other things I learn about him as the time rolls on. He tells me he goes to the gym daily. He tells me he goes to the tanning beds. When I told him that's bad for his skin, he says ""Well I only go twice a week! I just hate looking pale in the gym lighting."" I come to find out he drives a little red corvette with the license plate ""MR UK"". I just can't believe such a character exists in real life.

The straw that broke the camels back, for me, was a comment he made about my boss. I happened to like my boss very much. She was cool and funny and outspoken. She negotiated me a sign on bonus when I started and a raise like 2 months into my job. I loved her. One day, we were talking about her, and Hank made an unpleasant face. I asked him, ""what's wrong? You don't like strong women?""

He said, ""no, no, I do! Just not the big fat ugly ones!"" He laughed. I did not.

After that, I started avoiding him or being meaner in subtle ways. Not enough to get in trouble, just enough to irk him. One time he brought up his accent, and I said, ""oh right. Whatre you, australian?"" Friends, he looked so offended, you would have thought I had told him he looks like a dogs asshole. Or shagged his mum (that's some British humor for ya).

Anyways, this went on for a little while. Suddenly he starts bringing up his girlfriend! There's a girlfriend in the picture, everybody! How long she's been there, or if she exists, who knows.

I wish there were more Hank stories, but alas, i only have one more because the pandemic started and we all went home. I didn't see or hear from Hank after that, at least not in person.

Cut to at least a year later. I'm at a new job now. I check my social media and see a message request. It's from Hank! He reaches out and asks how I'm doing. Asks if I'm married. Asks if I'm happy in my marriage. Jfc does this guy ever take a break? Well, since I'm not longer at that company, I take the liberty to absolutely unload on him. I tell him, rather politely I'd say, that I think he's a loathsome mysogenist and the sight of him makes me ill. That I wouldn't be interested in a friendship with someone like him if he paid me. That he's a small, weak man, and I feel bad for his ""girlfriend"" if she ever existed. He blocked me immediately after, and that was the end of that.

Sometimes I remember Hank and his comically tight polo's that look like he bought them at the children's section at the GAP. I think about him in the tanning bed, in his little MR UK car, or flexing in the gym. I picture my words popping into his head intrusively and it bursts his ego, if only for a moment.",1,1745539583.0,coworkerstories,0,0.67,False

# Main Content: The Best B2B Sales Tools I Use for Prospecting (That Actually Work)

Hey there, fellow hustler! If you're reading this, chances are you're in the B2B sales game—or at least trying to get better at it. And let me tell you, prospecting can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack... if the haystack was also on fire.

I've been in your shoes. I've spent countless hours manually hunting for leads, sending cold emails into the void, and praying for responses that never came. But over the years, I’ve discovered some **absolute game-changers**—B2B prospecting tools that actually move the needle.

Today, I’m breaking down the **best B2B sales tools** I use daily, why they work, and how you can leverage them to crush your lead generation goals. And yes, I’ll be honest—some tools you’ve probably heard of, while others are hidden gems (like **Lead Foxy**, which I swear by).

So grab a coffee, settle in, and let's dive into the tools that’ll turn your prospecting from frustrating to *freaking rewarding*.

# The Core Problem: Why B2B Lead Generation Feels Like Pulling Teeth

Before we get into the tools, let’s address the elephant in the room: **lead generation sucks** when done manually.

Think about it:

* You spend hours scraping LinkedIn for contacts.
* You guess email formats ([*first.last@company.com*](mailto:first.last@company.com)*? f.last? firstl?*).
* You deal with fake emails, unresponsive leads, and ghosting.

Sound familiar?

That’s why smart B2B sales teams rely on **high-quality prospecting tools**. The right tech stack does the heavy lifting so you can focus on **selling, not sleuthing**.

Alright, friend—let’s take a breather. We’ve covered a *lot* of ground today, from **B2B prospecting tools** to **lead generation** hacks that can literally transform how you fill your pipeline. If you’re anything like me a few years ago, you’re probably thinking, *“Okay, but which tool will actually move the needle for MY business?”*

Here’s the thing: prospecting isn’t about stacking tools like Jenga blocks. It’s about finding the ones that fit *your* workflow so well, they feel like a natural extension of your process.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**1. What exactly is a B2B prospecting tool, and why do I need one?**  
Great question! A **B2B prospecting tool** is software designed to help you find, qualify, and connect with potential business clients—without the manual grunt work. Think of it like a supercharged assistant that scours the web for leads, verifies contact info, and even automates parts of your outreach.

You *need* one because manual prospecting (hello, endless LinkedIn scrolling) is time-consuming and inefficient. These tools cut your research time in half, ensure you’re targeting the right decision-makers, and boost reply rates. For example, [**Lead Foxy**](https://leadfoxy.com) automates email extraction and campaign management so you can focus on closing deals.

**2. How do I choose the best B2B lead generation tool for my business?**  
Start by asking:

* **What’s your goal?** (e.g., cold email outreach, LinkedIn prospecting, or building lists).
* **What’s your budget?** Some tools offer free tiers (like Lead Foxy’s trial), while others are pricey but packed with features.
* **Does it integrate with your stack?** Check if it works with your CRM (e.g., HubSpot, Salesforce).

My golden rule: Prioritize tools that simplify your workflow. Overly complex platforms waste time. For example, [**Lead Foxy**](https://app.leadfoxy.com) lets you extract emails *and* run outreach campaigns in one place—no juggling 5 apps.

**3. Are free B2B prospecting tools worth it, or should I invest in paid options?**  
Free tools can be a good starting point (like LinkedIn Sales Navigator’s basic features), but they often have limits (e.g., restricted searches or no email exporting). Paid tools unlock scalability and precision—like Lead Foxy’s verified email extraction or AI-driven campaign analytics.

Try free trials first (shameless plug: [Lead Foxy’s free trial](https://app.leadfoxy.com) lets you test-drive premium features). If you’re serious about **B2B lead generation**, investing in a paid tool pays for itself in saved time and higher conversions.

**4. How can I ensure my cold emails don’t end up in spam?**  
Ah, the dreaded spam folder! Here’s what works:

* **Use a prospecting tool with email verification** (like Lead Foxy) to avoid invalid addresses.
* **Warm up your domain**—tools like Mailbox Warmup help build sender reputation.
* **Personalize subject lines and content** (no “Dear Sir/Madam”!).
* **Avoid spam triggers** (e.g., “Buy now!” or excessive exclamation points!!!).

Pro tip: Lead Foxy’s campaign tool includes spam score checks to keep your deliverability high.

**5. What’s the biggest mistake people make with B2B prospecting tools?**  
Using them as a “spray and pray” machine! Tools amplify your efforts, but they *aren’t* a magic wand. The key is **targeting**. For example:

* Don’t blast generic emails to 1,000 leads.
* Use filters to narrow by industry, job title, or company size.

Tools like Lead Foxy help you build hyper-targeted lists (e.g., “Marketing Directors at SaaS companies with 50–200 employees”) so your outreach feels tailor-made.

**6. How do Lead Foxy and other lead generation companies differ from LinkedIn Sales Navigator?**  
Sales Navigator is great for *finding* leads, but it doesn’t help much beyond that. You still have to manually extract emails, verify them, and handle outreach.

**Lead Foxy** (and similar tools) go further by:

* Extracting emails/contacts from LinkedIn *and* other B2B social media.
* Automating follow-ups and tracking replies.
* Providing analytics (e.g., open rates, best send times).

In short: Sales Navigator is a flashlight; Lead Foxy is a GPS.

**7. Can B2B prospecting tools really replace human effort?**  
Nope—and they shouldn’t! Tools handle the heavy lifting (data scraping, email sequencing), but *you* bring the human touch. For example:

* Use templates but tweak each email with personal details (e.g., “Congrats on your recent product launch!”).
* Jump into conversations when leads engage.

Tools like Lead Foxy free up your time so you can focus on building relationships, not grunt work.

**8. How quickly can I expect results from using a prospecting tool?**  
It depends on your outreach volume and targeting, but here’s a realistic timeline:

* **Week 1:** Build your lead list and set up campaigns.
* **Week 2–3:** Start seeing replies (if your emails are personalized).
* **Month 2+:** Optimize based on analytics (e.g., A/B test subject lines).

With Lead Foxy, users often book their first meetings within 2–3 weeks—especially if they leverage the AI-driven campaign tools.

**9. What’s the best way to measure the ROI of a B2B prospecting tool?**  
Track these metrics:

* **Lead-to-meeting ratio:** How many leads turn into calls?
* **Reply rates:** Are your emails resonating?
* **Pipeline growth:** Compare your pre-tool and post-tool pipeline value.

Most tools (including Lead Foxy) offer dashboards to track this. If the tool pays for itself in closed deals or time saved, it’s a win.

**10. Why should I try Lead Foxy over other lead generation companies?**  
Glad you asked! While other **lead generation companies** overcomplicate things with bloated features, Lead Foxy keeps it simple but powerful:

* **All-in-one:** Find leads, extract emails, *and* run campaigns in one place.
* **B2B-specific:** Tailored for LinkedIn and other B2B networks.
* **Transparent pricing:** No hidden fees or upsells.

Second incident is when I was having a disagreement with my parents about scheduling for an event. My dad got pissed and tried to restrain me so I threw a coffee cup on the ground I was holding onto. It shattered and I didn’t intend it to do so.. but yk. Then he dragged me to the stairs and threw me down them. I fell pretty hard. 

The next one was when my mother and I were having an argument and I took a charger from a pile (we all use btw) and she restrains me in the same manner my father has before. She then threw me on the ground and up against the bannister. She then proceeds to push me and throw me in many different directions. 

She was more physically abusive when I was 15 and she even admits to it as abuse- but idk what to call this.

Idk if I deserve what’s going on here or if it really is no big deal. Someone pls let me know. ",1,1745538809.0,AmIOverreacting,4,0.67,False

***Family is Hell***

*T*he rooster crows at the first spark of dawn warmly tinting my room with a bright orange hue. I rub at my eyes jumping straight from my stiff bed. Pongo jumps in tune with me, ears up, and cuddles close instinctively. I peer across my room at the window facing the forest, the edge of our property line.

All I can see is the fog. It grows thick across the land’s perimeters in a matter of a few blinks, or maybe that’s my poor vision. Right at the point where my parent’s tree stood right at the edge of the woods the fog seeped from the seams of the gapping forest, like how when blood spurts from a wound. The wind blew hard causing a few tree branches to hit my windowpane, knocking me from my stupor. Shaking my head I get out of bed, Pongo jumping off while clinging close to me.

""Come on, time to start the day,"" I whisper, sounding like I’m gargling down gravel as I pull on a fresh pair of overalls. I brush my teeth with a hurried fervor, running down the stairs as delicately as possible, trying with all my might to not wake my grandparents. Pongo's paws are only an arm's length behind me as I hop down the steps.

Reaching the kitchen floor, the cold draft goes right through my overalls. I snatch my cardigan from the coat rack, rushing out through the back door. Leaning against our house a bucket of chicken-feed sat; a red label, *All and Sundry*  plastered across it half haphazardly. I sigh, if only it was closer. With both my bony hands I tightly grip the handle as I struggle to drag it just a few feet across our property. Out of breath and it's barely dawn, Pongo barks at me excitedly wagging his fluffy tail. Through what felt like an ***hour*** I finally drag the heavy container across our property and to the chicken coops’ gate.

“Come on out guys!” I call out to the hens and our good ol’ rooster. We had Lady and Damsel, our beautiful girls, who pecked and hawed as they strutted out of their coop. Richard, the lazy bird swaggering confidently out of the coop last. I walk in, blocking Pongo from following me, sprinkling the red feed distracting them as I gather their eggs from the chickencoop. 

Finding a few and some I might have missed a few days before. I plop them in my basket, leaving the coops trying not to get pecked on my way out of the pen. I make my way back with Pongo at my heels. That’s when I hear a thunderous vroom rumble across the horizon. As if on fire the sparkly, bright red Mustang grinds against the dirt, stirring up a cloud behind its custom wheels. Rock and roll music could be heard loud and clear as it came torpedoing closer. 

I rush past the back door, setting the basket on the kitchen counter as I storm out to the front porch. I grip the banister tight as the red mustang makes a dramatic skidding stop a little too close to our home. If grandpa saw, he’d have a heart attack. Emerging came smoke, then a lanky leg dressed in black leather. His auburn mullet attached to the man’s head was a beacon in the smog. I can see why my Dad called him a bargain-bin rockstar. 

“Hey Uncle Wayne.” I murmur, waving my hand awkwardly as he takes a long drag from his *Camel* cigarette.

Jumping out from the car was a small boy, my little cousin Billy, wearing a sherpa jacket with a pair of robin blue rain boots. His dirty blond head of hair was a mess and his big brown eyes still didn’t fit his head right. His ruddy face and nervous twitching only made him look smaller as he hid behind his Dad’s lanky legs. 

Uncle Wayne throws the cigarette to the ground, grinding it into the gravel path with his snakeskin shoes. “Abbie Ray, yeah? You're taller.” He notes going for another cigarette within a blink. Confused, I stumble over my next few words.

“Uh, you haven’t seen me in over nine years so…” I look at my feet, shoulders tensing, Uncle Wayne takes a long drag leaning against his red mustang. Pretending he didn’t hear me he hops up the porch steps, entering the house as if he owned the place. Confidence seems to be his normal state of being. Billy sticks close behind him pretending to be his father’s shadow’s shadow.

“Grandma and Grandpa haven’t woken up yet.” I remark going inside straight to the kitchen. “Do you want coffee, Uncle Wayne?” 

“Nah, can’t stand the stuff. Can you make me some eggs?” He asks, dropping into the dining chair causing it to creak, straining from the sudden impact. Billy plays with the zipper of his jacket as he sits beside his Father. I nod begrudgingly, not able to hide my pursed lips as I turn around to do what he asked. Grandma always said you had to be a good hostess after all. 

Turning on the stove top while I crack the first egg against the counter top Grandma and Grandpa come down the staircase seemingly in a rush. Grandpa was ready for the morning duties, wearing his usual overalls and work boots but Grandma still wore her fluffy scarlet robe and slippers. I look between Grandpa and Uncle Wayne feeling the tension in the air burning between them like a house made of hay during the dry season.

“You dare show your face here boy.” Grandfather’s dark expression only holds contempt as he glares down at Uncle Wayne. Uncle Wayne took another drag, smoking in the house and ignoring Grandpa’s glare. 

“Henry! Stop, not in front of the kid.” Grandma clenches Grandpa's shoulders tensing at the sight of Billy. She hadn’t seen him just as long as me after all. She was probably itching to pinch his cheeks at this point. 

The only thing you can hear in the room is the whisking of the bowl as I prepped Uncle Wayne’s omelet. Grandpa stone cold silent under Grandma’s obvious duress, glaring at the man lounging at their kitchen table. Grandma takes her hands off his shoulder and slowly walks over to Billy, who seems to just realize he’s the center of attention. I pour the mix into the sizzling pan, my eyes flickering between them.

Grandma sits by Billy warmly smiling at him, while Grandpa in contrast loudly drops into the chair directly across from Uncle Wayne. To glare at him head on I assume. 

“Are you hungry?” Grandma asks Billy, who nods his head enthusiastically smiling, one tooth missing in the front of his wide smile. I quickly set the dishes on the table, interweaving between Grandpa and Uncle Wayne’s glare off. 

“Thank you!” Billy happily scarfed down the scrambled eggs as if it was the first thing he ate in a while. Grandma Cecil pats his back as Billy almost choke in his hurry. 

From my peripheral I could see Uncle Wayne finally putting his cigarette out as Grandpa silently dug into the unsalted scrambled eggs. The more he ground the food in his mouth, the angrier he appeared. Uncle Wayne ignored him, seemingly a skill he had perfected over time. Grandma goes to the mudroom grabbing what looks like a bag of feed from *All and Sundry Co.* She grabs Pongo’s bowl and fills the red pebble like feed to the very top, overflowing. 

“What are you doing?” I ask quickly getting up from my seat to intervene. “We have plenty of dog food left.” I put my hand on hers. Her thin brows scrunch up wrinkling into a glower firmly taking her bony wrist out of my grip. 

“You have some attitude this morning, little lady. We know the quote now don’t we, Abbie Ray? *‘Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others,’* we take these lessons to heart, hm.” Grandma Cecil’s exasperation was leaking off her as she laments. “Now off with you, get the chores done before Grandpa starts toiling.” She starts muttering off about something walking back to the table. 

I grab my plate and quickly drop to Pongo’s level so he could finish it before I dump it into the sink. Readying myself at the door I start dawdling, playing with the buttons of my coat. Pongo sits at my heels looking up at me with a floppy eared head tilt. I press my finger to my lips, trying to be as inconspicuous as possible.

“Why weren’t you at David’s wake?” Grandpa's usually too loud for a house to contain voice is now unsettlingly quiet, the threat clear in his tone. I swallow my tongue, standing still, hoping to blend in with the furniture as his obvious anger simmers. Grandma’s back was turned away from me gently caressing Billy’s hair as he ate unaware of the oncoming argument.

“David and Liz wouldn’t have wanted me there.” Uncle Wayne shrugs, eating the last few bites of his omelet.

“Don’t bring your brother’s wife into this you ingrate. Blaming dead people for your actions, it's disgraceful!” Grandpa bellows out, grandma and I quickly freeze in a state of shock.

“David didn’t call you before that day, now did he?” Uncle Wayne mutters licking his fork, not able to meet Grandpa’s gaze across the table. Grandpa’s hand slams. 

*Whack!* 

The table vibrates from the impact. Grandma and Billy flinch away, Uncle Wayne blatantly ignores it, and I’m a foot closer to the door wishing I had left when I had the chance.

“David didn’t do anything for himself and you knew that, you used his kindness against him! Like how you *always* use the people around you. Bah!” Grandpa guffaws, waving his hand in the air as if that would rid him of Uncle Wayne. Uncle Wayne abruptly stands up from the table shoving the chair backwards with an awkward skid. The phone in his pocket rings. He goes for it, an excuse born from thin air. Maybe pure luck. He rushes past me as if hellfire was burning at his heels. He's out on the front porch clutching his phone tightly like it's his lifeline.

With the door left open in Uncle Wayne’s rush to flee and with my grandparents currently distracted, I make my exit onto the porch with Pongo. There Uncle Wayne whispered into his phone and I can’t help but stop. I quietly step closer to hear what Uncle Wayne is saying. 

“Jessica! No wait, don't hang up…please just take him for one weekend. He’s been asking for you.” I hid behind the miscellaneous tack trunk, trying my best to be sneaky while my forty pound dog was leaning against me the whole time. Hopefully he doesn’t notice his incessant wagging tail. Definitely visible. “You told me you’d see him! You promised me we’d go out as a family. He wants to see his mom—” The other line grows louder and he shrinks back from it as if his eardrums exploded from the volume change. He puts it back to his ear quickly. “Jessica! Jessica!” He repeats the woman’s name over a few times. “Fuck, fucking bitch…” He starts redialing her number putting it back to his ear. From this angle I could see his dark scowl morphing his features into something far crueler than usual calm overly confident demeanor.

“Jessica, your son has every right to see you! If you want to ignore me, fine bitc–uh hum, but don’t ignore our kid.” He grimly murmurs into the phone.  I know now he’s definitely not talking about my parents. I try to sneak onto the porch steps and out of his crosshairs as he screams into the phone once again. My self-preservation kicked in at that very moment.

Too late his dark brown eyes—a similar shade of my father’s beelines straight at me. As if a spotlight was beaming down on my shocked still form. He latches, as quick as a whip, a firm grip wrapped around my small forearm. I wince trying to shake off his painful grip.

“Think you're being sneaky?” Uncle Wayne snickers his grip tightening to a bruising degree.

“I-I’m sorry Uncle Wayne I won’t do it again! I promise I won’t eavesdrop…” I apologize quickly, feeling pain shoot up my arm in waves, getting worse with every passing second. His eyes had this dark cruel glare to them that made him look like he was on the verge of a tirade. He was trembling with unbridled rage, his phone in his other hand, raising it as if ready to strike me like a rattlesnake readying itself to bite. 

In a flash Pongo pounces, biting Uncle Wayne’s arm. Yelping, Uncle Wayne lets me go, almost falling on the wet wooden porch floor. I jump back holding my arm close, wincing in pain. Pongo stands between us getting low on his hind legs, growling and snarling, an obvious warning. Trying to gulp down my fear I try to soothe Pongo petting his soft back over and over. 

“It's okay, Pongo, I’m alright.” I plead to Pongo not wanting to cause any more trouble.

“You're like your mom…” Uncle Wayne snarls while shaking his arm, blood dribbling down from the bite. Waving his pain away as if it didn’t look like a showcase in grime and gore. Pongo bit him so deeply he might need stitches, with the way his forearm looked like my Ma’ undercooked meatloaf. “A troublemaker, just stay out of my way from here on, and keep that mongrel away from me.” Uncle Wayne grumbles a sneer flickering on his snarling face, his auburn goatee residing on his chiseled chin looks extra devilish as he storms away. Probably looking for a first aid kit with the way that bite looked. Apparently not caring if he bumps into Grandpa just as long as he’s far away from me and my ‘mongrel.’

Limping down the front porch steps and trying to shake off the pain of Uncle Wayne’s handprint throbbing on my forearm I make my way to the butcher shed on the side of our house. I pull the hood of my raincoat up, hoping to stay dry. The *All and Sundry* employees put the slop products away in our freezers—apparently it needs to be kept at a specific temperature at all times. 

Opening the shed’s wobbly oak door, it's quite quaint, aside from the massive freezer my Dad invested in a few years back. He loved the art of butchery and thought it was worth every penny, funnily enough Grandpa didn’t argue. As I walked past the butcher station I pointed ignored all the tools and the blood hook attached to the wall. With a wet shiver, I open the alien-like freezer, cold smoke comes out of it in clouds, I struggle to grab one of the many containers lined up inside. 

With a heaving, struggling breath and sore arms, I drag the large bucket across the wooden floor with a loud shriek. Leaving the shed, Pongo barks and jumps the whole time as the bucket lands in the mud with a wet *ka-thud*. 

I stop, my lungs burning, trying to catch my breath and I glare at the Barnhouse knowing it's going to take a time and half to get there. Puffing up my chest and tucking in my chin, I grip the handle tightly in my tiny fist and move with determined steps, digging deep  with each slow step in the thick mud. 

*Caw. Caw.*

I jump, my heart shoots up into my throat, and my eyes see the feathers before finding the crow just a few feet behind me. It was big, no, it was almost as big as me, and its eyes…its eyes gave a dead stare. It didn’t move or fly away, just stared. Slowly taking my eyes off it I see I had dropped the vat, its top popped open and the red slop chunks of processed goo spilled out. I fall to the ground and quickly gather as much of the feed as I can with my bare hands. 

The red slimy–texture like homemade grits as it runs through my hands, struggling to put it back into the large tub.

I drag the container, rushing to the pig’s pen connected to our main stable. Fear makes my heart beat loudly in my ears and as if on auto-pilot I turn my body around–feet dragging in the mud, to see the crow *has* moved closer. It stood above the slop that was left behind in my scramble to flee, picking at the scraps violently, tearing whole into the ground. Gobbling it down, gorging on it so viscously I could see the lumps expand down its large throat.

*Caw. Caw.*

Closing my eyes tight, not caring if I get all the feed into the trough anymore. The red slop plops, slithering out of the bucket with the consistency of sludge, similar to the casserole we ate last night. The red chunks reek of rotten fruit, finally unable to stop myself from gagging at the pungent aroma, I start to dry heave. The smell resembles old roadkill left on a street baking under the hot sun. I stare hypnotized as the pigs come rushing out towards the trough smelling their food even from within the barn.

I look away, unable to look at the pigs engorging on the red slop with an aggressive frenzy resembling a lunch hour at my grandparents’ favorite buffet. Shivering, puckering my lips I shove my nose into my collar, not able to look at their frenzied feeding for any longer. I rush inside the main Barnhouse ignoring the grotesque smell and eerie feeling of the large crow watching my every step.

Right before I close the door I grow brave enough to glance at the crow, and the moment it catches my eyes it looks back directly at me.

*Caw.*

Spewing a large chunk of red goo landing on the ground near my feet with a  *thwack*. Just right before the ugly bird flies off into the grey sky disappearing into the thick fog surrounding our perimeter. Swallowing down my bile, I slam the farmhouse door closed, the wood vibrating under my cold numb hands. Trying to calm my beating heart, I look and see Pongo happily sitting in front of me, wagging his fluffy tail without a care in the world. I laugh, not able to help feeling ridiculous, shaking off the odd occurrence. I move towards Boone’s stall. Pongo follows me close, almost falling into my shoes.

 Absentminded I grab the red hay placing it into Boone’s bucket with my rusting pitchfork. Boone’s large muscular flank turns away and his muzzle goes instinctively towards the food. The toes of his hooves skid against the stall’s straw floor. In his leisurely movements diving his muzzle straight into the bucket to chomp down on the new feed with an asmr like rhythm. I pat his head brushing my fingers into his mane before sighing, knowing I had to put his tack on him soon, I lean against the stall’s gate.

Just as I start to hum a tune I can hear grandfather’s clopping old boots, stomping their way through the barn’s front entrance. His face looks haggard, as if he’s aged another ten years since this morning. His eye bags could be classified as carry on if he ever decided to travel on a plane. Which he never would.

“Go help your grandma with the cows.” He remarks, with a jerk of his finger, as if waving me off as if I was some pest. Grandpa slowly carries Boone’s tack bellowing at the horse all while doing so. “Stupid fucking glue….”  Not wanting to get in his crosshairs I slink out of the stables and head towards the cows’ barn. A crack of a whip is heard and Boone cries out with pained whinny. Grandpa’s yelling was only drowned out by the continuous rain and my steps that distanced me from those horrible sounds.  I continue to drag the bucket of feed to the cows’ Barnhouse, leaving a deep mark in the mud. 

I do a double take, seeing dark feathers appear at the edge of my vision, turning around all while holding my breath reveals nothing but the clear field of un-toiled dirt. I gulp, unable to hold in a hiccup of relief before I turn around, taking the last few steps towards the second Barnhouse where our cattle resided. Entering inside I can already see Grandma hard at work, already milking Brie. With her back turned to me I use the last of the feed, pouring the rest of the red goo into their troughs. 

“You’re late and I’ve already done your job, girl.” Grandma mutters with disdain. Her crackly hands grabbing for the bucket full of milk gesturing for me to take it. “Make yourself useful and take this to the kitchen.” She grumbles,  getting up from the creaky stool with knees that creaked just as loudly. I nod back and forth my red curls bouncing accordingly as I struggle to lift the large bucket with my noodle arms, it sloshes with the gallon of milk.

Getting back to the house, leaving a dent in the damp dirt, since I’m unable to lift anything heavier than an overly buttered biscuit. Knocking the front door open dramatically, Uncle Wayne and Cousin Billy jump in surprise simultaneously. Eyes are as wide as comic strip characters. The kitchen table almost knocked Billy’s untouched breakfast to the floor. 

“Jesus!” Uncle Wayne exclaims loudly smacking his hand on the table with a loud bang. Billy uses the ties of his sherpa jacket to make the hood close in on his face as he burrows into his chair. 

I try to catch my breath, as I take off my muddy boots and drag the bucket into the kitchen, ignoring Uncle Wayne. I can feel his glare burning into the straps of my overalls as I put the milk into glass jugs that were lined up on our marble counters. I do so with a methodical and experienced rhythm, but now apparently we have to put the *All and Sundry* logos on our product.

“Abbie Ray, have you ever heard of manners or did your Daddy forget to teach ya’ that?” Uncle Wayne's deep voice is coated  in condescension from across the room. I freeze still as stone, sticking the last label on the final glass bottle. I gulp down my anger as I put glass jug after glass jug into the square shaped wire container. Blinking repeatedly trying to ignore Uncle Wayne's overly thin eyebrow raised in a high arch, waiting for me to take the bait. Unable to hold it in, I'm about to give a smart aleck reply right before Pongo interrupts with an excited yip. Grandma bursts in soaking wet from the rain that's suddenly starting to pour cats and dogs. 

“Betsy is far along; I think she’s due any day.” Grandma says softly out of breath and whipping her green raincoat off on the old coat rack. Hurriedly putting the wired container of milk into our large fridge I turn back awaiting Grandma’s instructions, used to doing so every night since Ma’s passing. 

“That’s great Grandma! Have you called the vet yet?” I ask while cleaning the countertop in order to start working on dinner. Whatever dinner it may be I’m just glad it's not anymore of those funeral casseroles.  

“Not yet, I’ll call in the morning to give a little update. I think we can handle most of it by ourselves when the calf comes. We’ve handled plenty alone before.” She says softly as she starts rummaging through the fridge. I can’t help but gulp down my thoughts and words, on the edge of blurting out the only reason we're fine without a vet is because Dad and Mom were here helping. But I bite my tongue.

“I can handle dinner dear, now go sit with your cousin and uncle.” She says with a dismissive hand wave before turning our old oven’s countertop on. Feeling my stomach twist uncomfortably I blurt out something before thinking it through.

“I’m actually really tired, if you don’t mind I’d rather go to bed early…” I say immediately, my wide blue eyes flickering between Grandma and Uncle Wayne who looks more pissed off by the moment. I yawn, stretching and bringing my arms up in the air with a  wide motion, Pongo follows my lead with a dramatic yawn himself. 

Grandma looks at me, her eyes trailing over my figure as if I was a runner up pig at the County Fair. I nervously fidget with the frayed edges of my overalls not wanting to look Grandma in the eyes. Grandma nods her head but I can tell she’s disappointed, I turn away, Pongo right on my heels as I head for the stairs.

I close my door and turn the lock with a soft click. Pongo jumps on my bed with not a bit of guilt on his cute face and lolling tongue, drooling a bit. I sigh, changing into my pajamas and jump into my bed and not wishing to move a muscle. Wrapping myself with a blanket I nuzzle into Pongo’s soft furry body which lay beside me in my small twin bed. I take a few deep breaths, my eyelids growing heavy as I fall into a deep sleep for once not thinking about either of my parents. 

“Get up girl!” A blink in a second of time my Grandfather’s gruff voice bellows, vibrating across my room’s thin walls. Its pitch dark outside except for the spare sparkling stars that shimmered past the thick fog.” Go feed the pigs again they already ate through their last feed time…” I catch his disgruntled mumbling at the end feeling oddly confused. Shrugging with a big yawn, Pongo already on the floor excitedly wagging his tail. I get out of bed with another big yawn not bothering to change out of my pajamas as I stumble down the stairs. Everyone was in bed but for grandpa, who was reading a book—I can’t see the title with how dim the light was, as he smoked on his pipe. He didn’t often smoke, knowing Grandma never approved.

Not wanting to dawdle, knowing Grandpa wouldn’t approve of it, I rush to put on my raincoat and boots as I walk out onto the damp front porch. The rain continued to pound on the dirt, the soothing rumbling of thunder was highlighted by the lightning in the distance. When it wasn’t here it was beautiful, but last spring proved thunderstorms to be quite dangerous. We had a willow tree a year ago that fell to the opposite side thankfully from being struck by lightning. If it went the other way it would have destroyed half the house. Grandma always said it was God’s plan. Ma and Pa said they were just thankful we were all okay. 

The cold rain pounded on my already frizzy curls as I stomped into the mud off my front porch, heading to the shed in a half-asleep state. Stepping inside the cold rackety shed I numbly opened the large freezer door, struggling to get another bucket of slop over the large gaping opening of the futuristic freezer. The humid cold fog permeates from the container seeping into my damp curls. 

*Thump* 

*Thump* 

 *Thump* 

The large container’s final thud sloshes into the wet dirt as I drag the container one hurried step at a time towards the pig’s stable. I take in a deep breath, fully awake now the cold rain is pouring hard as the rapids. Drizzling straight down on my vibrant yellow raincoat. I freeze, squinting, my eyelashes clings to thick globs of rain droplets that cloud my vision enough to make me falter in my step. 

Lightning strikes and the silhouette of a crow, not a few feet across the barren muddy field, as large as the scarecrow it looked like. I gasp the thunder loud enough to swallow my voice. I struggle to retighten my hold on the handles of the *All and Sundry* bucket as I hurry my steps to get to the door. The cold rain pounds harder and bites at my pale knuckles making my body feel numb. My eyes flicker back to where I saw the oddly large crow, but the thick darkness and slow thunder rumble didn’t give me any clear view. 

I open the doors quickly, turning the measly old light on and it flickers. My eyes trail down expecting to see sleeping pigs....instead they were huddled together in a tight circle facing away from the pen’s gate and empty trough. A cold chill seeps into my shivering bones as I try to take a silent step forward.

Lighting strikes the ground, the smell of ozone permeating the air around me as I blink to regain my vision. The light bulb pops. Thunder rumbles and the light that encases Pongo and I’s shadows disappear with the light. The pigs that huddled together, their dark silhouette’s turned slowly towards me just as if noticing my presence.

A flash of lighting cracks, thunder booms rumbling the wooden frames, the fog from the open door seeps into the Barnhouse permeating the walls. Their pig snouts move up in the air, as if taking a whiff of the food I brought in. My shivering weak grip falters, already slick with rain water, fingers fumbling at the horrid sudden sight of the lightning spotlights. Their teeth...they were flat and filed down to perfect squares. Just like a human’s smile. They all had these big disgusting grins, unanimously, stretching their fleshy faces wide.

I scream dropping the bucket of feed onto the hay floor running into the night not thinking about anything but getting away. The cold rain pelts down into my very bones as I run, my rain boots stomping into the mud making me sink with each terrified step. Pongo barks running after me cackles raised and teeth flashing at my reaction. Out of breath, the one lamppost still lit on our farm property flickered as if ready to stop working the moment I jumped onto the porch steps.

I slam the front door open swinging back loudly on its unoiled hinges all while I take off my muddy boots. Throwing my raincoat to the floor without a second thought all while I can hear grandmother’s gasp in the background. I ignore my family's silently loud judgement as I run up the stairs, slamming my bedroom door with a good thud. 

Pongo jumps onto my bed still soaking wet from the rain burrowing into the center of my twin bed. I glared at him the whole time I’m struggling to get out of my soaking wet jean overalls, which felt like they weighed over forty pounds. I jump into my bed under my slightly damp covers as if that would protect me from what I saw. My eyes wandered back towards my bedroom window to showcase the night sky. The moon was barely visible under the thick rumbling clouds that spewed bolts of lightning every few seconds.  

The rain continued to belt down and terrorize the dirt. The fog from this morning seems like a wisp to what it was now. Thick clouds greet the earth to submerge our lands without a second thought to who inhabited it. The barely visible lamp post light that held on by inkling of oil now fizzled out and died leaving our land submerged in a thick fog and nothing else. I cling to a wet and panting Pongo, his tongue lolling out as he leaned against me. Rubbing my eyes tiredly as I cling further into his soft damp fur as I try to ignore the wet dog smell. I lean down to pet Pongo’s soft muzzle just as lightning flashes and with a sleepy blink within a moment of time I see human shaped brown eyes on Pongo’s face.

I didn’t choose $COUCHFART. It chose me.

It started with a creak.
A subtle shift in the cushions.
My couch sighed — not from age, but from awareness.

I asked it if it was okay.
It whispered back:
“You need $COUCHFART more than I do.”

I thought I was losing it.
Then I checked the Telegram.
Someone was mid-monologue, claiming their recliner had predicted the dip.
Another was trading chart patterns based on couch stain formations.

I wasn’t alone.
I was part of something… deeply unhinged.

One guy sold his TV to average in.
Another painted his loveseat with motivational quotes.
The quote said:
“Sit down. Shut up. Hold on.”

Every post felt like a group hug between breakdowns.

Now I don’t even check my PnL.
I just ask the furniture for vibes.

The coffee table says we’re early.
The beanbag disagrees — but he’s been bearish since 2022.

I meditate on upholstery.
I journal in crumbs.
My spine is ruined, but my soul feels… rearranged.

We are the $COUCHFART faithful.
Holding through dips, creaks, and emotional flatulence.
Bound not by logic — but by shared absurdity.

Take a seat.
Stay awhile.
Or forever.

1k76t7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/1k76t7b/i_smoke_crack_twice_a_week_you_stay_sober_every/,I smoke crack twice a week. You stay sober every day. Guess which one of us is winning?,"Let me break something down for the willfully average: not all drug use is created equal. Not everyone who smokes crack is a “crackhead.” That’s a word you use to simplify a world you don’t understand. I smoke crack twice a week. Like clockwork. Not out of addiction, not out of desperation, but because I’ve discovered something 99% of you never will: *how to weaponize intensity*.

Let me paint a picture.

I wake up at 5:12 a.m. I don’t need an alarm. My body just knows. I drink a glass of water (with electrolytes, obviously), I stretch, I thank God or the simulation or whatever runs this world, then I sit cross-legged in complete silence until I *feel* it’s time. Then I smoke crack. One or two hits. Not to get ""high."" I’m not chasing a feeling. I’m **tuning my brain** like a Formula 1 car before a race.

And then the day begins.

By 6:00 a.m. I’ve already reorganized my entire file system, built out a Notion template for the next five years of my life, cleaned the grout between every bathroom tile, and written three emails that get read like *poetry*.

You know what the average sober person is doing at 6:00 a.m.? Snoozing an alarm on a mattress that smells like anxiety and broken dreams. You stumble to the kitchen and think you’re a warrior because you made black coffee without sugar. That’s your peak. That’s the big flex for your day.

Meanwhile I’ve already conquered tasks you’ve been procrastinating for a year.

Let’s keep going.

The mailman walks by my apartment every morning. He’s got that defeated look in his eye. Like his soul left his body in 2009 and nobody told him. He moves like time is a punishment. I wave to him. He doesn’t wave back. I don’t blame him. He probably saw me through the blinds, shirtless, typing 160 WPM while doing calf raises and thought, “Why isn’t that me?” But he’ll never ask. Too much pride. Too little energy.

Cops drive by. I nod. I have nothing to fear. You think they’re scary? I’ve stared into the core of my psyche on a Tuesday afternoon while my oven made *whispering noises*. I’ve already made peace with chaos. A badge doesn’t scare me. A Glock doesn’t scare me. I've fought ego death with nothing but a cracked screen and Bluetooth jazz.

My neighbor is a sober guy. He drinks kombucha and listens to Joe Rogan. He meal preps. He’s got a vision board and a 401(k). He also has dead eyes. I asked him once what he thinks about when he’s alone. He said “usually just work stuff or fantasy football.” I almost cried. That’s it? That’s the **entire inner world** of the ""healthy"" man? No visions? No cosmic jokes? No wars between angels and intrusive thoughts?

You ever feel your cells vibrate like a symphony of pure intent? No? I have. Last Thursday. On crack.

I’ve had moments on this substance where time split open like a rotten fruit and I saw **everything**. Every lie, every truth, every reason we fear honesty. I’ve smoked crack and realized I was still in love with a girl from 6th grade, then laughed about it and rewired the emotional circuit live on the spot. Can kombucha do that? Can cold showers do that?

I doubt it.

I’m not saying you should smoke crack. In fact, most of you shouldn’t. You don’t have the structure, the ritual, the **respect** for power. You’re the type of people who drink six beers and text your ex like a feral animal. You can’t even handle **McDonald’s** responsibly. Crack would eat you alive. But me? I broke it down. I studied it. I conquered it. And now it serves me.

My brain is sharper than yours. My thoughts are faster. My fears are smaller. My output is massive. You fear “losing control.” I lost it once and realized there was nothing to fear in the first place.

So next time you judge a smoker like me, remember: you’re not better because you’re sober.  
You’re just **slower**, duller, and probably still lying to yourself about why you wake up tired every day despite 8 hours of sleep.

But Bobby's law just passed in Montana(Tuesday). Making a minimum sentencing for causing a death while drinking and driving especially those with a bac of .16 or higher.
So here is Bobby's story as I know it. Bobby is great friends with my daughter and her long time bf, they all went to junior and high school together. My daughter turned 21 in January 2023, her bf and very tight with Bobby turned 21 in February and Bobby turned 21 march 10. They all had elaborate plans for there 21st. Bobby being the last of the 3 to turn 21. 
Anyway my daughter is kinda a visionary and I don't want to add any drama to the already sad story. But she was having major anxiety about attending Bobby's birthday celebration, she literally txt me several days prior saying she had a bad feeling and would she be a bad friend for not attending. Longer story short(believe or not)she chose not to attend. Bobby and his 2 buddies celebrate his birthday, whilst crossing the road from the Blue moon tavern to the town pump convince store/truck stop Bobby was hit and killed by a 4 time due conviction driver,  his 2 friends were right there...witnessed every thing. Bobby Dewbre got to be 21 for a whole 25 hours.
Oh that drunk driver got 18 months for killing Bobby. 
Bobby's family have created the Montana bar fairies...I encourage everyone to Google and support them. I personally donate every month, they leave coffee cards on cars left at the bar, because those car owners chose to not driver and took an Uber or alternate transportation. 
So yeah...stop drinking subreddit with all your don't hurt anyone's feelings and don't tell the facts because it might make our members feel bad for all the drinking and driving stuff. FU Bobby's law passed. ",17,1745537589.0,dryalcoholics,0,0.9,False

After getting my full medical disability in February this year, I had to go to the main office one last time. 
I had to return a phone and a couple keys I still had. 
My former employer wanted to combine this moment with a last cup of coffee and a cake. 
I got to name a list of colleagues who I'd like to see one last time, so I made a trip down memory lane with a couple guys who all marked key points in my 7 years at that company.

Because I can't drive long distance anymore a colleague came to pick me up, he had his MS dx 9 months ago. This gave us the opportunity to bond and exchange our stories for about 3 hours (1,5 hours singel trip) that day.

The day was a good day looking back on it. It kind off gave me some closure on the ""working"" part of my life. We all shared memory's, talked about the last 2 years sinds my Dx, about the future and about MS  in general for some who had questions about it. 
I thought it would be weird saying goodbye and closing the door for the last time. But it wasn't, It felt like closure and the beginning of a new chapter in my life.

That day I lost a couple colleagues but gained a friend. 
Up next is trying to find my way in life without a job. what will be possible now? How will I fill my days? How do I find porpoise in life? I still don't know but I am shure I will find my way some day.",10,1745537431.0,MultipleSclerosis,4,0.92,False
1k76mne,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1k76mne/wishbone/,Wishbone,"Kelly Winters stared at the rain blurring her windshield, one hand gripping the steering wheel while the other clutched her phone. Six months since the accident, and still every drive home felt like punishment. The rain made everything worse. Rain like the night Lily died.

""Ma'am, you've been sitting there for ten minutes.""

Kelly jumped. An old man stood outside her car window, hunched under a faded umbrella. The shop behind him—something she'd never noticed before—sat wedged between a laundromat and a vacant storefront. A hand-painted sign hung crookedly: ""CURIOS & REMEDIES.""

""Sorry,"" Kelly muttered, tucking her phone away. She'd been looking at photos again. Lily at the beach last summer. Lily blowing out six candles. Lily alive.

""Nasty weather to be sitting in a car,"" the old man said. His eyes were unsettlingly pale against his dark skin. ""Perhaps you'd rather come inside?""

Kelly should have driven home. Instead, she followed him.

---

The shop interior smelled of dust and something else—herbs maybe, or incense. Shelves crammed with junk lined every wall: old dolls with glass eyes, jars filled with unidentifiable things, books bound in cracked leather.

""I don't know why I came in,"" Kelly said. ""I should go.""

""You're grieving,"" the old man said simply, moving behind a cluttered counter. ""That's why you came in.""

Kelly froze. ""How did you—""

""It hangs around you like a shadow. Heavy grief. Recent loss."" He tilted his head. ""A child, I think.""

""My daughter,"" Kelly whispered. The words still felt like swallowing glass. ""Six months ago.""

The old man nodded. ""And you blame yourself.""

""It was raining. I was texting my boss that I'd be late picking her up from dance class. Just for a second. Just one fucking second looking down..."" Kelly hadn't told anyone this part. Not even the police. But something about the old man's eyes made the truth spill out.

""Ah."" The shopkeeper reached beneath the counter. ""Perhaps I have something for you.""

When his hand emerged, he held what looked like a real wishbone, yellowed with age but polished to a shine. It hung from a thin leather cord.

""The hell is that?""

""Exactly what it appears to be. A wishbone. But unlike the ones from your Thanksgiving turkey, this one works."" His smile revealed teeth too perfect for his weathered face. ""One wish. Not two people pulling. Just you.""

Kelly laughed, the sound brittle even to her own ears. ""Right. And how much for this magical wishbone?""

""For you? Nothing."" He extended his hand. ""But a warning: wishing has consequences. The universe maintains its balance.""

""Bullshit,"" Kelly said, but she took it anyway. The bone felt warm against her palm.

""It must be worn next to the skin, over the heart, for three nights. On the third night, hold it and make your wish. Be specific. Be careful."" His fingers closed around hers. ""And remember—everything has a price.""

---

Kelly almost threw the wishbone away twice that night. Once after three glasses of wine, when she caught herself believing in magic like a desperate fool. Again at 3 AM, when she woke gasping from a dream where Lily called for her from beneath dark water.

But by morning, the leather cord hung around her neck, the bone hidden beneath her blouse, resting against her skin.

Her friend Melissa noticed it at lunch.

""New necklace?"" she asked, reaching for it.

Kelly jerked back. ""It's nothing. Just something I picked up.""

Melissa frowned. ""You seem off today. You taking those pills Dr. Ramirez prescribed?""

""I'm fine,"" Kelly said, though she'd flushed the pills weeks ago. They made her fuzzy, disconnected. Made her forget Lily's voice.

That night, lying in bed, Kelly held the wishbone between her fingers. One more night after this one. Then she could wish Lily back. She wasn't stupid—she knew this was bullshit—but something about the old man's certainty had infected her.

She dreamed of Lily dancing in her pink tutu, twirling faster and faster until she blurred, her face stretching into something unrecognizable.

---

The third night arrived. Kelly sat cross-legged on Lily's bed, surrounded by stuffed animals collecting dust. The wishbone felt hot against her chest, like it knew.

She lifted it, holding it before her eyes.

""I wish for Lily to be alive again,"" she whispered. Then, remembering the shopkeeper's words, she added, ""I wish for my daughter Lily Winters to be returned to me, alive and whole, exactly as she was before the accident.""

Nothing happened. Of course nothing happened.

Kelly laughed, a jagged sound in the silent room. What had she expected? She slipped the necklace off and placed it on Lily's nightstand. Stupid, pathetic hope.

She fell asleep in her daughter's bed, tears drying on her cheeks.

---

""Mommy?""

Kelly's eyes snapped open. Gray dawn light filtered through pink curtains.

""Mommy, why are you in my bed?""

Kelly turned her head slowly, certain she was still dreaming.

Lily stood in the doorway, her blonde hair tangled from sleep, wearing the unicorn pajamas Kelly had packed away in boxes months ago.

""Lily?"" Her voice cracked.

""Duh. Who else would I be?"" Lily rolled her eyes, the perfect sass of a six-year-old. ""Can I have Fruit Loops?""

Kelly couldn't move. Couldn't breathe. Couldn't process the impossible sight before her.

""Mommy? Are you crying? Did you have a bad dream?""

Kelly lunged forward, gathering Lily into her arms, touching her face, her hair, her warm, solid arms. ""Oh my god. Oh my god.""

""You're squishing me!"" Lily complained, but she hugged back.

Kelly couldn't stop touching her, confirming her reality. ""Baby, what's the last thing you remember?""

Lily scrunched up her face. ""Going to sleep in my own bed. But you were in your bed. Why'd you come in here?""

""I just missed you,"" Kelly said, wiping tears. ""So, so much.""

""That's silly. I was just sleeping."" Lily squirmed out of her grasp. ""Can I please have breakfast now? I'm starving.""

---

The next few days passed in a blur of joy and disbelief. Kelly called in sick to work. She took Lily's temperature constantly, checked her pulse while she slept, and cried in the bathroom where Lily couldn't see.

Miracle. That's what this was. A goddamn miracle.

But on the fourth day, Kelly noticed something odd. Lily was coloring, pressing so hard with her crayon that it snapped. She didn't flinch at the sound but kept grinding the broken piece into the paper until it tore.

""Lily? You okay, sweetie?""

Lily looked up, and for a split second, her expression seemed blank, like she was trying to remember how to arrange her features. Then she smiled. ""I'm hungry, Mommy.""

""You just had lunch an hour ago.""

""I'm still hungry."" Her voice dropped lower. ""I need more.""

A chill crawled up Kelly's spine. ""More what, baby?""

Lily blinked, and she was just a little girl again. ""More juice, please!""

That night, Kelly woke to find Lily standing beside her bed, just... staring.

""Jesus!"" Kelly gasped. ""You scared me. What's wrong?""

""I had a dream,"" Lily said, her voice flat. ""I was under the water. It was dark, and I couldn't breathe. But then something found me there. Something that let me come back.""

Kelly's mouth went dry. ""Come here, sweetheart."" She lifted the covers.

Lily climbed in but lay stiffly beside her. Her skin felt cool to the touch.

""Lily, you know Mommy loves you, right?""

""Yes,"" Lily answered, but she was staring at the ceiling. ""Can we go to the park tomorrow? I want to see the other children.""

---

At the playground, Kelly watched Lily on the swings. She pumped her legs normally, laughed normally. But something was different in how she watched the other children. Too intent. Too hungry.

A little boy fell off the monkey bars and started crying. Lily stopped swinging abruptly and walked over to him, kneeling down.

Kelly tensed, ready to intervene, but Lily was just helping him up, patting his shoulder. The boy's mother thanked her.

""What a sweet little girl you have,"" she told Kelly.

""Thank you,"" Kelly said, forcing a smile.

On the way home, Lily asked, ""Mommy, do you ever think about dying?""

Kelly nearly swerved off the road. ""What? Why would you ask that?""

""I think about it,"" Lily said, looking out the window. ""I remember what it feels like.""

""Lily, you haven't—"" Kelly stopped herself. How could she say, ""You haven't died"" when clearly, Lily had?

""I know I was gone,"" Lily said quietly. ""And now I'm back. But I'm different now.""

Kelly gripped the steering wheel harder. ""Different how, sweetie?""

Lily turned to look at her, eyes too serious for a six-year-old. ""There's something else in here with me. Something that helped me find my way back."" She tapped her chest. ""It's hungry, Mommy. All the time.""

---

That night, Kelly found the pet hamster dead in its cage. Not just dead—torn apart, its tiny organs arranged in a perfect circle.

""Lily?"" she called, panic rising in her throat. ""Lily, where are you?""

She found her daughter in the bathtub, fully clothed, water running over the sides onto the floor. Lily's hands were clean, but the front of her shirt was stained dark.

""He was alive,"" Lily said dreamily. ""And then he wasn't. I wanted to see what was inside."" She looked up at Kelly with Lily's face, Lily's eyes, but something else looking out. ""I'm still hungry, Mommy.""

Kelly backed away, slamming the bathroom door shut. She leaned against it, heart hammering.

This wasn't her daughter. Not completely.

The wishbone. The fucking wishbone.

She had to find that shop again.

---

The old man didn't seem surprised when Kelly burst through his door the next day. She'd left Lily with Melissa, claiming a doctor's appointment.

""She's not right,"" Kelly said, cutting straight to it. ""She looks like Lily, sounds like Lily, but something else is in there with her. Something hungry.""

The shopkeeper nodded slowly. ""I warned you of consequences.""

""Fix it,"" Kelly demanded. ""Undo it. Whatever the hell you did, undo it!""

""I did nothing,"" he replied calmly. ""You wished. The bone granted. But such wishes cannot simply create life from nothing. They must... borrow from elsewhere.""

""What are you talking about?""

""Your daughter died. Her soul moved on. But the body I returned to you needed... a tenant. Something was happy to oblige. Something that has been waiting for a very long time for a door back into this world.""

Kelly felt bile rise in her throat. ""What is inside my daughter?""

""Nothing human,"" he said simply. ""And it grows stronger each day. Soon, very little of your Lily will remain.""

""Take it back,"" Kelly begged. ""Please.""

""I cannot. But you can."" He reached beneath the counter again and produced a curved knife with a bone handle. ""The bone brings, and the bone takes away. Blood that binds can also release.""

Kelly stared at the knife. ""What are you saying?""

""The child must die again,"" he said, his pale eyes unblinking. ""Only then will both your daughter and the other be released. But this time, it must be by your hand.""

""You're insane,"" Kelly whispered. ""I'm not killing my daughter.""

""It is not your daughter anymore,"" he replied. ""And soon, it will be strong enough to need more than hamsters to feed its hunger.""

---

When Kelly returned home, Melissa was waiting on the porch, face pale.

""Where's Lily?"" Kelly asked, stomach dropping.

""In your bedroom, napping. Kelly, we need to talk. Lily said some... disturbing things.""

""Like what?"" Kelly unlocked the door with shaking hands.

""She told me she remembers dying. In detail. And then she asked if she could..."" Melissa swallowed. ""If she could see what my insides looked like. Jesus, Kelly, it was the way she asked. Like she was asking for a cookie."" Melissa grabbed Kelly's arm. ""She needs help. Professional help.""

""I know,"" Kelly said. ""I'll take care of it.""

After Melissa left, Kelly crept to her bedroom door. Lily lay curled on the bed, looking peaceful, innocent. The knife felt heavy in Kelly's purse.

""I know you're not sleeping,"" Kelly said softly.

Lily's eyes opened. They looked darker somehow, the blue fading to something murky.

""You went to see the bone man,"" Lily said. Not a question.

""Yes.""

Lily sat up, head tilting unnaturally. ""He told you to kill me.""

Kelly's breath caught. ""He told me to release you. Both of you.""

""The other one doesn't want to go back,"" Lily said. ""And neither do I. I like being alive again.""

""Are you really my Lily? Still in there?""

Something flickered across Lily's face—fear, sadness, a plea. ""Mommy, I'm scared. It's getting bigger inside me. Eating more of me."" Her voice was suddenly childlike again, trembling.

Kelly took a step forward. ""Baby—""

Lily's expression hardened, twisting into something adult and ancient. ""Stop. You brought me back because you couldn't stand the guilt. Your fault. Your fault I died.""

""I know,"" Kelly whispered.

""You don't get to undo this now,"" Not-Lily hissed. ""I'm here. I'm flesh again. And I'm so fucking hungry.""

Lily lunged forward with inhuman speed, fingers curved into claws. Kelly stumbled back, fumbling in her purse for the knife.

""Lily, please—""

""Lily's almost gone,"" the thing said, its voice deepening impossibly. ""But I can wear her face for you. Be your daughter. Just feed me. The neighbor's cat. That yappy dog down the street. Then maybe the baby that cries all night next door.""

Kelly's fingers closed around the knife handle. ""No.""

""Then the little boy from the park. His fear was so sweet. I could taste it just standing near him.""

Kelly pulled the knife free. ""You're not my daughter.""

""But I could be,"" it offered, Lily's face softening into a child's pleading expression. ""Mommy, please don't hurt me. I'll be good.""

Kelly's hand trembled. ""My Lily. My real Lily. If you're in there, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry for everything.""

The thing lunged again. Kelly raised the knife.

---

The shop was exactly where she'd left it this time. Kelly entered without knocking, the wishbone clutched in her bloody hand.

The shopkeeper looked up from a book. ""It is done?""

Kelly nodded, numb. ""She fought at the end. Not Lily—the other thing. When it knew what was happening, it fought.""

""And your daughter? Did you feel her release?""

Kelly remembered the moment the knife pierced her daughter's heart. The flash of relief in Lily's eyes, the whispered ""Thank you"" before the other thing took control again, thrashing and screaming in languages no human throat should produce.

""Yes,"" she said. ""She's free now."" She placed the wishbone on the counter. ""Destroy this thing.""

The shopkeeper smiled sadly. ""I cannot. Its purpose is not fulfilled.""

""What are you talking about? I made my wish. I paid the price. It's over.""

""The bone was not meant for you,"" he said softly. ""It was meant for the one who comes after you. The one who will wish for what they have lost. Just as someone wished before you.""

Cold understanding washed over Kelly. ""There's always someone grieving. Always someone desperate enough.""

""Yes.""

""And the... thing. The one inside Lily. Will it find another way back?""

""Eventually. Such things are patient. They have eternity."" He picked up the wishbone and polished it with a cloth, the bloodstains vanishing under his touch. ""Would you like to know how old this bone truly is? How many wishes it has granted?""

Kelly backed toward the door. ""No. I never want to see it again.""

""Yet you brought it back,"" he observed. ""You could have buried it. Burned it. But you brought it here, to continue its work.""

Kelly had no answer for that.

""Go home,"" the shopkeeper said gently. ""Grieve properly this time. Accept the loss. And perhaps, in time, forgive yourself.""

---

Six months later, Kelly stood in her new apartment in a new city, hanging photographs. Lily at the beach. Lily blowing out six candles. Lily alive in memories where she belonged.

When the doorbell rang, Kelly found her new neighbor standing there, eyes red from crying.

""Sorry to bother you,"" the woman said. ""I just... I lost my son last week. Car accident. The grief counselor said I should try to be social, but I don't know why I'm telling you this.""

Kelly recognized the weight of fresh loss, the desperate shadow of guilt. ""I understand,"" she said quietly. ""I lost my daughter a year ago.""

""Does it get easier?"" the woman asked.

""Not easier. Different."" Kelly hesitated. ""Would you like to come in for coffee?""

As the woman stepped inside, Kelly noticed something hanging from a chain around her neck. Something bone-white and curved like a wishbone.

Kelly's mouth went dry. ""Where did you get that?""

""This?"" The woman touched it. ""Strange little shop downtown. The old man who runs it... he said it might help with my grief.""

Kelly's hand shot out, closing around the talisman. ""Take it off. Right now.""

""What? Why?""

""Because whatever you're wishing for,"" Kelly said, staring into the woman's startled eyes, ""the price will be more than you can bear.""

The wishbone gleamed between them, patient as always, waiting for the next desperate heart willing to pay the terrible price of getting exactly what they wished for.

---

The story continues with Kelly's desperate attempt to convince her neighbor of the danger...

The woman—Amy was her name—stared at Kelly like she'd lost her mind. Kelly didn't blame her. 

""This is just a trinket,"" Amy said, pulling the wishbone from Kelly's grasp. ""The old man said it would symbolize hope. That's all.""

Kelly felt sick. The same words, probably. The same routine. How many times had it played out?

""What exactly did he tell you about it?"" Kelly pressed.

Amy shifted uncomfortably. ""That I should wear it for three nights. That on the third night, I could make a wish."" She looked embarrassed. ""I know it sounds stupid. But when you're desperate...""

""Believe me, I know."" Kelly moved to her kitchen cabinet and pulled out a bottle of whiskey. ""You're going to need this for what I'm about to tell you.""

Kelly told her everything. About Lily's death. About the wishbone. About the thing that came back wearing her daughter's face. About the hamster. About the knife.

Amy looked horrified by the end, her drink untouched. ""That's... that's a terrible story. But it's just a story. This is just a piece of carved bone."" She fingered the wishbone nervously.

""Take it off,"" Kelly urged again. ""Please. Just humor the crazy lady next door.""

""My son was only four,"" Amy said, her voice breaking. ""He drowned in our pool. I just stepped inside to answer the phone. Just for a minute.""

The guilt. Always the guilt. The wishbone knew how to find it, feed on it.

""I understand the temptation,"" Kelly said. ""God, I do. But whatever comes back won't really be your son. Not completely.""

Amy stood up shakily. ""I should go. Thank you for the... advice.""

""Amy, wait—""

But she was already heading for the door. The wishbone gleamed against her blouse, catching the light like something alive.

---

Kelly couldn't sleep that night. Amy was on her second night with the bone. One more night, and she'd make her wish. One more night before another door opened.

At 3 AM, Kelly found herself outside Amy's apartment door. She still had a spare key to her building from when she'd considered taking the unit before Amy moved in.

Breaking and entering. This was madness. But she couldn't let it happen again.

The lock turned silently. Kelly slipped inside, heart hammering. The apartment was dark except for a nightlight in the hallway—the kind for a child who feared the dark.

Kelly moved toward what she assumed was the bedroom. The door was ajar. Inside, Amy lay sleeping, one hand clutched around the wishbone at her throat.

Kelly approached slowly, knife in hand. Not the bone knife from the shopkeeper. A kitchen knife. This wasn't about ritual—just about stopping the cycle.

She leaned over, ready to cut the leather cord while Amy slept.

""I wouldn't do that if I were you.""

Kelly jumped back. Amy's eyes were open, reflecting the dim light like an animal's.

""Amy—""

""Not quite,"" said the thing using Amy's mouth. It sat up slowly. ""She's asleep. Dreaming of her son. But I felt you come in.""

Kelly gripped the knife tighter. ""What are you?""

""The same as before. The same as always. Hungry."" Amy's head tilted at an impossible angle. ""You didn't think you were the first, did you? Or that your daughter was my first... accommodation?""

""Let Amy go,"" Kelly demanded. ""Before she makes the wish.""

The thing laughed with Amy's throat. ""But I like her. So much guilt. So much pain. The bone knows how to find the right ones.""

""The right ones for what?""

""For opening doors."" Not-Amy smiled. ""You see, grief tears little holes between worlds. The bone widens them enough for passage. Your friend will wish her son back tomorrow night. And I will answer, as I answered for you.""

Kelly lunged forward with the knife, but Amy's body moved with impossible speed, catching her wrist.

""No, no,"" it whispered. ""Not yet. The cycle isn't complete.""

With strength no human should possess, it flung Kelly across the room. Her head cracked against the wall, and darkness swept in.

---

Kelly woke to sunlight streaming through unfamiliar curtains. She was in her own bed, in her own apartment. Had she dreamed it all?

The bruises on her wrist and the throbbing in her head told her otherwise.

Tonight was the third night. Tonight, Amy would wish her son back.

Kelly spent the day calling Amy repeatedly. No answer. She pounded on her door. No response. 

By evening, Kelly was frantic. She tried the spare key again, but the locks had been changed. She considered calling the police but knew how that would sound.

""Yes, officer, my neighbor is about to use a magical wishbone to bring back her dead son, but actually it'll be a demon wearing his face.""

Night fell. Kelly sat in her car in the apartment parking lot, watching Amy's windows. The lights were on. Around midnight, they went out.

Kelly forced herself to wait one more hour. If Amy was following the pattern, she'd make her wish and go to sleep, expecting nothing to happen.

Just after 1 AM, Kelly approached Amy's door again. This time, she didn't bother with subtlety. She smashed a window with a rock and climbed inside, cutting her arm in the process.

The apartment was silent. Kelly moved through the darkness, blood dripping from her sleeve.

""Amy?"" she called softly. ""Amy, are you here?""

A small voice answered from the back bedroom. A child's voice.

""Mommy went to get ice cream. She said I could wait up.""

Kelly's blood ran cold. She knew before she even entered the room. 

A small boy sat on the bed, swinging his legs. He looked perfectly normal—tousled brown hair, Spider-Man pajamas, curious eyes.

But Kelly knew better now. Knew what to look for.

""Hello,"" she said carefully. ""What's your name?""

""Zachary,"" the boy said. ""But everyone calls me Zack."" His head tilted. ""I know you. You're the lady from next door. The one who tried to take Mommy's special bone.""

Kelly nodded slowly. ""That's right.""

""Mommy made her wish,"" Zack said, smiling. ""And I came back. Isn't that nice?""

""Where is your mom now, Zack? Really?""

The boy's smile widened unnaturally. ""Getting ice cream. I told you.""

""No,"" Kelly said firmly. ""Where is she?""

The thing wearing Zack's face sighed. ""You're no fun. She's in the bathtub. She was so happy to see me that she got very tired. I helped her take a nap.""

Kelly felt sick as she backed toward the bathroom. She hit the light switch.

Amy lay in a tub of crimson water, eyes open and empty, throat torn out. The wishbone rested on her chest, gleaming wet and red.

""She was confused when I came back,"" the boy's voice said from the doorway. ""She screamed. Said I wasn't her Zack. That I was wrong somehow."" He giggled. ""She was right.""

Kelly turned slowly. ""You killed her.""

The thing in Zack's body shrugged. ""This form was hungry. And now the bone is ready for its next owner. Someone else will find it. Someone else will wish."" His eyes—its eyes—met Kelly's. ""Maybe you'd like to try again? Bring back your Lily one more time?""

""No,"" Kelly whispered. ""Never again.""

""Then our business is concluded."" It moved toward the front door with unchildlike grace. ""Though I do wonder... if you had brought the bone knife, could you have freed little Zack? We'll never know now.""

Kelly followed it into the living room. ""Where are you going?""

""Out into the world,"" it said simply. ""This body is young. It could last for years with the right care. Someone will take in a lost little boy, don't you think? Someone kind.""

The implication hit Kelly like a blow. This thing would live among people, wearing a dead child's face, feeding its hunger however it pleased.

""I can't let you do that,"" Kelly said, blocking its path.

""You can't stop me,"" it replied. ""Not without the bone knife. And even if you could, would you kill a child? Again?""

The weight of that question struck her hard. Could she? To save others?

The answer came with sudden clarity. ""Yes. To stop you, yes.""

""Interesting,"" it mused. ""Most humans hesitate.""

""I'm not most humans anymore."" Kelly reached for a heavy lamp. ""You made sure of that.""

The thing's expression shifted, and for a moment, actual concern flickered in those borrowed eyes. ""You would destroy this body knowing the real Zachary is trapped inside with me? Aware of everything?""

Kelly faltered. ""You're lying.""

""Am I? Your daughter was aware. She thanked you for freeing her, didn't she?"" It took a step closer. ""But this boy might not be so understanding. He might spend eternity hating you for what you're about to do.""

Kelly's grip tightened on the lamp. ""If that's true, then freeing him is even more important.""

She swung. The thing dodged with inhuman speed, but she'd anticipated that. She changed direction mid-swing, catching it on the backswing.

Glass shattered. The boy's body crumpled.

But it rose almost immediately, blood streaming from a gash on its temple. Its eyes had changed now, glowing faintly in the dim room.

""Very well,"" it hissed, voice no longer childlike. ""If this body is damaged, I'll simply need a new one.""

It launched itself at Kelly with terrifying speed. Teeth—suddenly too sharp, too numerous—snapped inches from her face. She fell backward, the thing on top of her, its strength overwhelming.

""Perhaps I'll wear your skin next,"" it growled. ""Would that be fitting? Would your Lily recognize her mother's face?""

Kelly's hand scrabbled desperately on the floor beside her, searching for a weapon, anything. Her fingers closed around a shard of the broken lamp.

As the thing lowered its face to hers, she drove the glass up under its chin with all her strength.

The body convulsed. A sound emerged that was not human—a high, keening wail that vibrated the windows. Black fluid, not blood, pulsed from the wound.

""Not... enough..."" it gasped. ""Not... the bone...""

Kelly pushed harder, twisting the glass. ""Then I'll make it enough.""

Something seemed to tear in the air around them—a sound like fabric ripping on a massive scale. The boy's body went rigid, then collapsed on top of her.

For a moment, Kelly thought she saw something dark and formless rise from it, stretching upward before dissipating like smoke.

Then there was only silence. And the small, heavy weight of a dead child on her chest.

Kelly gently moved the body aside. Zachary—just Zachary now—looked peaceful, as if sleeping. The wound under his chin leaked ordinary red blood.

She should call the police. Try to explain. But what could she possibly say?

Instead, she went to the bathroom and removed the wishbone from Amy's cold fingers. This had to end. Here. Now.

In the kitchen, she found matches and a metal trash can. She dropped the bone in, doused it with cooking oil, and struck a match.

Nothing happened. The bone wouldn't burn.

Kelly tried everything—lighter fluid, the stove burner. The bone remained intact, not even scorching.

""Fine,"" she whispered. ""If I can't destroy you, I'll hide you.""

Hours later, as dawn broke, Kelly stood on a bridge over the deepest part of the river. The wishbone, wrapped in chains and locked inside a small lead box she'd bought at an all-night hardware store, weighed heavy in her hands.

""Goodbye,"" she whispered, and dropped it into the churning water below.

It sank instantly. Gone.

Kelly drove back to her apartment, clothes still stained with three different people's blood, and began to pack. She would leave this place. Start over somewhere new. Again.

As she threw clothes into a suitcase, her phone rang. The screen showed an unknown number.

""Hello?"" she answered cautiously.

""I believe you have something that belongs to me."" The shopkeeper's voice was unmistakable.

""It's gone,"" Kelly said. ""I threw it in the river. You'll never find it.""

The old man chuckled. ""My dear, did you really think water would stop it? The bone has been drowned, burned, buried, locked away for centuries. Yet it always returns to continue its work.""

""What is it? Really?""

""A key,"" he said simply. ""A key that opens doors between realms. Doors that should remain closed.""

""And your role in all this?""

""I am its keeper. Its caretaker between... users.""

""Well, you've failed,"" Kelly said bitterly. ""It's gone. And I'm leaving. You won't find me again.""

""I don't need to find you,"" the old man replied, sounding amused. ""The bone will find who it needs. It always does.""

Kelly hung up and finished packing. She would run. She would hide. She would try to forget.

But as she loaded her car, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. From the river. From the shadows. From everywhere.

The cycle wasn't broken. It was just beginning again.

---

Three months later, in a town hundreds of miles away, a young man walked along a riverbank after a heavy rain. Something caught his eye—something white, half-buried in the mud.

He bent down and picked it up. A bone, curved like a wishbone, with a broken leather cord still attached.

As his fingers closed around it, it felt warm. Almost alive.

Behind him, unnoticed, a figure watched from the trees. Kelly had been tracking the bone's path downstream for weeks, waiting for it to resurface. Waiting for its next victim.

She stepped forward, knife in hand. Not the bone knife—she hadn't been able to find the shop again, no matter how hard she'd tried. But perhaps any knife would do, if her will was strong enough.

The young man turned, startled by her approach.

""Sorry,"" Kelly said, forcing a smile. ""I think you found something that belongs to me.""

The bone gleamed between them in the setting sun, its purpose endless, its hunger eternal.

So a background. I 31M have been with 41M since 2013, married in 2016.

Throughout the relationship and since the end there were many issues I had to deal with it’s a long story but I’ll bullet list them. 


MONEY 

- failed to make me get a joint account with him so he made me send him half the bill money each month increasing it over time 
- he refused to pay payday loans and mobile phone bills back from before I met him. 
- He always took joy telling me all about how he would earn more than me like he has trying to belittle me.
- he stole money from my wallet
-he constantly took items out on finance. In the end he did it without even asking me because he knew I’d say no (out of the fact we couldn’t afford it). I’d just get home and it’d be there. 
- he made me send my wages in full to him when I got paid except a few hundred to cover some direct debits of my own. I was to use a credit card he had and paid off.
- I got questioned about every purchase made on that credit card. He began to even begrudge me getting something to eat with the card while I was at work. 
- lied to me about how much we owed in loans and credit cards. The amounts always changed.
- refused anything second hand even if it was in good condition. He was very rude once to my family about something they offered for us to have. 


SUBSTANCE

- he is an excessive drinker and even drank continuously for three or four days in a row without a break. He drank wine by the bottles and spirits he recently swapped wine for beer.
- he would go to the shop to buy alcohol in order to punish me after an argument. Sometimes he even caused arguments just as a reason to go to the shop. 
- he told me it’s normal for people to drink to get drunk and I’m a control freak. ( he means every night at home alone. Not even in a bar).
- I couldn’t stand his company drunk as he is volatile and was a general nightmare when drunk so I used to come home from work each day and spend it alone upstairs with the cats and social media as a distraction.
- he then blamed me for his drinking saying that he drinks because I spent the evenings separately. 
- I had to hide any alcohol I was purchased in the boot of my car or in other peoples houses or he would drink it in its entirety. He drank a whole bottle of whisky before that was supposed to be a gift for someone. 
- he only visited my parents with me because there was alcohol in the house. When my parents stopped offering him it he then stopped coming with me to see them. 
- he hid alcohol over the house and drank it in secret thinking I wouldn’t find the empty cans and bottles everywhere. He hid them in the garden plants, the shed and under the bases of the kitchen cupboards. He’s even taken them to the bins in the street and once ditched them in the river. 
- he shouted at me any time I wanted to talk about money or alcohol as a means to stop the conversation. 
- he was taken to hospital twice in the relationship for alcohol poisoning.  Once he had to be checked for brain damage from dehydration. The nurses kept asking me if I was ok from this. I remember being embarrassed about that. 
- showed up drunk to a formal awards night at my workplace. It was very embarrassing and I found myself making excuses for why he wouldn’t go places with me anymore. I couldn’t trust him to not show me up. 
- he is addicted to strong  “over the counter” painkillers. He will take them claiming he needs them to go to sleep at night. He even drank bottles of medicine designed to make people sleep when they have the flu. He would abuse these meds for hangovers too. 


VIOLENCE 

- one occasion he throw a mug of coffee at me (mug included) this left a big bruise on my stomach. 
- threw an empty wine bottle towards me. It hit the floor and disintegrated into millions of tiny splinters and left a hole in the tiles.
- threw sauce dips at me 
- punched me in the face and head as I was driving a car because I refused to go out with him while he was drunk. It caused me to bleed from my mouth. Then he grabbed the steering wheel of the car and tried to make us swerve into the oncoming traffic. Luckily I didn’t crash it. When I called the police he was running away up the main road and he called me and said to me “what have you done!” 
- I’ve had to physically restrain him on a few occasions to prevent him causing damage or assaulting me.
- during an argument he went upstairs and slammed the bedroom door. He then grabbed the radiator and pulled it off the wall in a rage. It was left hanging by the pipes and water was leaking out. 


FRAUD

- he took out a credit card in my name and moved one of his credit card debts onto it to keep the payments interest free. He took my ID one day and opened it online. I didn’t know or agree to it. It would’ve been a no if he had asked. He paid minimum payments on this for years and then maxed it out right after by buying alcohol with it, so the debt never went down. It was approx 4k. 
- I took a card out for myself to build my credit with after I left but the card went to the old house and he got it. He opened my post and either he himself or his sister to use and she tried to get thousands out at ATMs with it while she was abroad. 
- he paid for my mobile phone on his account. Money for the phone was taken from why I paid him so effectively I paid him to pay the account so my mobile was always mine. After the split I stopped paying him and got my ow phone and contract sorted out, he cut my old phone on the day i first didn’t pay for the old phone. He had control over the old one and I needed to cut ties and live independently again. He reported my old phone to the provider as either lost of stolen. He knows I have my phone and I can prove the payments I made to him. He’s doing this to claim on the insurance. We only knew about it as my disabled mum is using my old phone at the moment and it suddenly cut out a few days ago. I’m currently reporting this one. 
- he was taking 50% of the mortgage payment from me after I left and he changed it to interest only without telling me. He took more money off me and paid next to nothing himself for a month. It is something we both needed to agree on with the bank and her lied to them telling them I agreed when I didn’t know anything about it. 
- he pretends to bet me on the phone all the time to different people
- his contact information was on my personal bank account that he shouldn’t have had anything to do with. I found that my bank statements were being sent to him every month by email without my knowledge.


HIS FAMILY

Then we have issues with his family during and since the break up…

- his mother guilt tripped him into sending her our cash into the thousands of pounds. To my knowledge it was never returned. He messaged me since the break saying words along the lines of “good luck proving the money I gave them”.
 - he got into a physical fight with his brother about a month before I walked out of the marriage. His brother had him on the floor my his neck and when his mother got between them both. His brother assaulted her badly. His brother was arrested and his mother told police it was me that assaulted everyone (thinking she could get his brother off the hook). I wasn’t even there and was able to prove this luckily. Everyone would have been drunk
- I stopped going to their family events months before this happened. 


With everything, I ended up with anxiety from everything that I was through. It built up and came out one night. There was no trigger at all I was having a nice night on my own as he was at work and I just suddenly broke down in tears. I checked myself into A&E thinking I was having a heart issue. Before this I was lucky to say I had never experienced mental health and I felt just how out of control it could get suddenly. 

The only other thing to mention is since the break up he’s keeping one of the cats from me and practically threw the other one out threatening to take it to a shelter if I didn’t pick him up. Both cats are mine and he knows it but in his controlling nature you can guess who the paperwork is under…  I did get my cat and he’s safe for now until I get somewhere sorted.

I moved back in with my parents and I have cut all the ties now except the house and the marriage to go. I tried being amicable through all the above and he throws it back in my face each time. I’ve seen him about since and he’s going to the gym now, got piercings and living his h*e era by most  accounts. The divorce doesn’t upset me. I mourned the relationship as I lived it. Quite frankly the separation was my liberation. I can breathe. I’m no longer having anxiety attacks and I’m not taking medication for it. I walked out and it went away… now that speaks for itself. I hope the divorce goes through soon I just want to move on and get somewhere of my own. 

Wow I just looked back and it’s a lot. Well done to you if you got this far! Ultimately I wanted to vent with this post and just check that what I experienced isn’t normal… but i wanted some advice from fellow people going through the process at the minute. What can I do to get this finalised as soon as possible ? (solicitors are so damn expensive, mine has been great so far). Given all the above, is there anything you’d recommend? Any tips appreciated ☺️

I’m 5 foot 3 weighing at 190lbs. I’ve been wanting to lose weight at lot more recently because of peer pressure. I have always been fat but I’ve never took initiative to lose weight. My household is also a reason why I haven’t lost weight. My parents always gave in to what I wanted since I was young so they would never stop me from eating. I would overeat even when I was full. I’ve recently been cutting out snacks and managing my portion sizes in meals. But most of the time my parents make meals with high carbs. And my dinner and breakfast is a cup of coffee with bread. My parents don’t allow us to touch the stove without supervision until we are 17. So I can’t make my own meals. I’ve been trying to exercise but my studies go first because of my parents. I’ve been trying to get exercise by dancing to my favorite songs but I can’t get consistent. What can I do???,1,1745537233.0,Weightlosstechniques,2,1.0,False

I'm in a predicament that I usually find myself in for most of the year. I currently work as a physician, but I'm on the initial-ish parts of my career where I work 80 hours a week for most weeks of the year, and most of my socialization comes from small talk at the grocery store check out line. It's a positive environment in my program, and I really enjoy my colleagues, but goodness does this kinda thing wear away at my cold, dead heart.

So, I came here looking for someone to put a little dopamine into my reward center - it'd be nice to have a bit of a distraction and get to know a new friend while I chip away at this schedule. What am I looking for? Comfy vibes, like sitting with a friend at a nice cafe while that one song by Nora Jones plays in the background and not too loudly - I don't even like that song much, but it is nice. Jokes, banter, rants - everything is invited.

I find things begin best with a question a lot of times, so here's a few for you to pick from:

1. How would you describe your perfect meal?
2. How do you take your coffee? If you don't like coffee, what beverage can I grab for you?
3. Do you think some animals do know how to talk and communicate with us, they've just chosen not to? Maybe because they want to avoid paying taxes or something.

If you've made it this far, here's a little more about me:  
I'm Jay, 30, from Texas. You already know what I do for work, but my dream job was to be an astronaut, I love aviation and space, I think I could find something cute about any animal, and overall I think laughing your way through most situations is an ideal strategy.

I look forward to hearing from ya.

1k76d2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1k76d2r/mil_hoards_food_and_knick_knacks_in_my_house_wwyd/,MIL hoards food and knick knacks in MY house - WWYD,"Hi everyone, I don't really use reddit much, and don't know of any mannerisms so pardon me if I get something wrong. So to start - I grew up pretty minimal. I was made to clean the house every day as a child, and we never kept ANYTHING we didn't use. Long story short, I keep my current house that way as an adult. I don't like a messy anything, and I don't like useless items (ie, we don't use them, not useless in the derogatory manner). 
I'm about to be 24, and am married (been together for 9 years). We just had a baby, and I had expectations about how to raise my child and the house we raise her in. My mother in law lives 9 states away, ans has been flying in every other week to ""help"" with the baby, although she dosent, she just takes pictures of her and sleeps at the house. It makes my wife feel better though, so it's worth it. 

More about my MIL. Growing up, her house was always a complete disaster, a house of 9 people, and always having trash, food, and clothes and broken items everywhere. There was not an inch of the house that didn't have items in it. If there was a shelf, you couldn't see the wood it was made of. Every knick knack had a story, and every piece of broken furniture had a reason for staying. Her fridge was full of food nobody ate, or was even allowed to eat at times becuase they were ""saving it"". She was an extreme couponer who lost money on couponing. She'd buy 50 cans of corn, just to never eat them. When they were evicted out of their house, it was bad enough the city just tore it down. They moved ALL of their items to the storage unit. I helped of course, but only becuase if I didn't, they'd make my wife do it all with them. 

Fast forward to today. They live in Florida, and rent out a house. It looks much better, but that's becuase they lost everything becuase they couldn't afford storage units in ohio forever. It's slowly becoming more cluttered there, but that isn't my problem. My problem is the fact that she now flies up here every 2 weeks, and fills my fridge with food. And I don't mean she buys milk, eggs, and cheese. She went to the grocery store, bought enough food for 3 people for a month, and it was mostly food only she liked. She did it under the guise of buying us food, but she knew that we didn't like most of what she bought. She came home with 5 cases of soda, 6 vitamin waters, and threw them on the floor in my kitchen. She then proceeded to order 4 boxes of LaRosa pizza, even though altogether we only went through 2, and we could have COOKED something that she just bought, or we had (we meal prepped for 3 months). She then also ordered 4 steak hoagie under the guise that Florida dosent sell steak hoagie? And she'll take them back on her flight in a week (gross?). She then also ordered dominoes, and other fast food items. I have thrown everything out before, becuase when she leaves, it all goes bad, and we're here to clean it up. But she dosent see it, and dosent care. I keep my fridge stocked, but not full. I have 3 racks, and keep the necessities (Milk, eggs, cheese, creamer[get to that in a second], lunch meat, bread, vegetables, soda, and water). I have more than that, but know that there's space to put items if we need to, but I prefer we eat what we have. I grew up where if you didn't finish your food, you ate it later. She puts food in the fridge under the guise she will, but then leaves back to Florida. It's hard to explain without picture attachments in the SR, but I think you get the point. But if not, just know it goes from being a fridge that has everything to feed a person but still having space, to food literally falling out of the fridge and being expired before we can get through any of it. 

Altgough we had other items she would being in (clothes for baby that were too small and couldnt even fit her anymore, puzzles and then leaving them half built, shelf knick knacks, plush animals[were up to like 9 now of BIG ones], and a few other big items that take up space in my room, including clothes she left here, and just left with them on the floor and in corners) but, Food is definitely the worst of it, and we even had a blow up where she stated she was leaving early, and it broke my wife's heart. This has been going in for 4 months though, and nothing had changed. 

I'm fed up, and actually feel depressed about the entire situation. I feel as though I haven't owned my own house for the last 4ish months. Wwyd? What even CAN I do? I'm not usually a pushover, but for my wife's happiness I am. But I bought a house for a reason. I worked my butt off for 5 years straight, doing 70-80 hour weeks to pay for this house to say I could have my own space. There are a few factors to put in recently within the last week that have caused more people than usual to appear at my house, but this has been an ongoing issue. I can't even escape to my room, or my basement becuase I've made room for other people. I'm at my wits end and don't know what to do. All my wife does is say don't be mad at me, but I've told her that it isn't her, it's her mother and her mother's lack of respect for me, my house, my rules, and how I feel. I can't even control the temperature my house is at without her taking control, and changing it in my sleep. I can't go out to the garage without her running and getting more food, or more knick knacks we never asked for or stuff we will never use. I have thrown away over 2000 dollars of food and knick knacks over the last 4 months, and it hurts my soul becuase that wasn't allowed as a child. We ate it. Not let it sit and rot. Wwyd, stuff like that. I feel as though I can't explain how bad it actually is through text, of that makes sense. I've never seen someone with a stomach staple have 4 separate drinks, and 5 separate foods from 9 separate getting up to grab food sitting at one time. I swear. A coke, a coffee, and 2 half drank water bottles, with 5 different foods she won't finish, and will just leave sitting out in the living room or kitchen. It's foul, and I don't think I can ever understand. ",1,1745536645.0,FamilyIssues,0,1.0,False

I do not have anyone to talk about my situation in real life and feel like my case is complicated due to my past experiences and would appreciate some input of yours.

**You may skip this part if you want to go to my current situation or read about the problem at hand first.**

*I am 32M, quite regular life with ups and downs but some traumatic experiences like my grandparents who meant a lot to me moving back to their original country when I was a child. Also dont feel like I received much love from my parents, though everything is great now and I can talk to them.*  
*In highschool my best friend passed away one day to another. I was consoled by a female friend who had a boyfriend and fell in love with her, fucked up her relationship and we had an ""undercover"" relationship in which she was emotionally abusive in hindsight. Up to this day I feel like this relationship was the biggest mistake of my life.  During that time my new best friend moved away. To cut this short I think I have anxiety of getting abandoned because of my past experiences. (Anxious attachment style)*

*This results in me seeking for a lot of attention from potential partners and getting really frustrated when they do not show the interest I expect from someone who is considering a relationship with me. I am well aware of this problem and try to deal with it as good I can but it can be overwhelming.* 

**Current situation:**

Right now I am meeting 32F, we got introduced by a common friend. The first time we met was a fiasco and I had 0 interest afterwards, firstly because she didnt want to stick to our initial plan of meeting for dinner on a sunday night and I didnt get attracted to her not just because of her looks but also because of her behavior.

Few months later I need a +1 for an event and she is the only person that comes to mind as I moved rather recently and dont know lots of people yet. Also we follow each other on social media and I liked some of her posts/stories and felt like I want to give it another chance. She agrees and we are supposed to meet near the event to go together. She is very late and we barely make it in time. At the event I like her behaviour as she pushes me to introduce myself to an important person in a positive way. Afterwards we go for dinner and have a good time, she invites me to a coffee next to her place. The day after she starts chatting with me and I fuck up big time by unintentionally insulting her (I have a bad habit of mocking people and made fun of her english which was very inappropriate, though I actually only make this sort of ""jokes"" with people I like. Which she could not have known of course and even if she did it is still not a nice habit of mine and I want to change). I apologize and try to make it up by inviting her for dinner etc but no can do and we are out of contact for a while again.

Few weeks later I have an accident and call her to ask about something and she helps me but denies several requests where I ask her out for dinner. At this point I am done and accept it.

She likes some of my social media posts after that though and few weeks later calls me and asks me for help with her pet. I agree and we we start talking again as me taking care of her pet got her interested again. We meet for some walks and I start getting more and more interested in her and feel like she might be interested too. Too shorten the rest up, we make some plans and she doesnt stick to them or postpones but at the same time messages me daily and sends me selfies. I get irritated as she was showing interest (laughing etc) when we met and messaging me daily but at the same time responding very inconsistently or from my point of view not making a lot of efforts to meet further.

Her time management (she has been repeatedly late to our ""dates"") was always bothering me and one of the reasons I didnt have any interest after our first date. She is quite busy with work, very ambitious and has a lot of hobbies and family she spends time with. Though regardless of that I dont think this can be an excuse. As someone who is rather clingy her communication and lack of time for me (my perception of course without knowing whether she actually is that busy and trying her best) is throwing me off.

We finally met again the other day and I had a serious conversation with her. I told her I am looking for a serious relationship as I want to marry and build a family and that if I were not interested in her we would not have this conversation. I told her that I do not understand her behavior as she seems interested and not interested at the same time. That her responsiveness and time management are disturbing me and that even with regular friends this would be unacceptable to me.

Her response was that she feels like I am very demanding and interogative which she does not like (understandably)  and that she is trying but that it is not easy for her timewise. She seemed understanding and we talked for a while. She mentioned what have been her issues with me so far. She felt like I was a negative person on our first date because I was only complaining about the place (I had moved there more recently) and didnt show a lot of interest in her (which I didnt because I was genuinely not too interested). Then a major problem was the incident I described before, where she felt insulted by my stupid mocking of her language skills. She still seems interested and outlined what she expects in general and what she does not like. F.e. she doesnt like negative people or complainers (which I can be at times even though I try to be more positive, its a process). She said we should just see how it goes and not try to force it. Perhaps it might work, perhaps we can become great friends etc.

The problem that I have right now is, I am not sure whether this can potentially work or not for the following reasons:  
\- I do not know whether she can change her time management or whether it would change when she likes me more or we become a couple (I assume yes)?, I am sure I cant be with a workaholic or someone who is barely around

\- I can be a nagger and negative at times, I am not sure whether I would be the right person for her but I guess that is hers to decide?

**My biggest concern right now in conclusion is this:**  
**Do we even have a change of becoming a happy couple and marrying? It did not start out great and there is still a lot of question marks and I just dont know whether its me hanging onto something because I want to start a family and feel like I am running out of time. Or can this actually work out despite the obstacles?**

**TL:DR**  
\- I 32M have anxious attachment style (clingy, need attention, fear of getting abandoned), want to get married and start a family. 

\- 32F is attractive to me, very successful, ambitious, seemingly from a very good family, seems to have a good character.

\- we got introduced to each other by a friend, first date was a desaster and didnt message each other for long time. Liked each others social media posts from time to time.

\- months later I need a +1 to an event and ask her, she agrees. We have a good time and she starts chatting to me the next day and shows lots of interest. I fuck it up big time and apologize but damage is done and she declines all efforts of mine to make up.

\- I have an accident and ask for her help, which she does. Few weeks later she asks me for help with her pet. We bond again and start meeting up. I start getting interested and see a chance of us working out. She sends me messages and selfies almost daily but is inconsistent with responses or further dates. The most disturbing part for me is like she doesnt respond or leaves a message unread but will watch my social media story meanwhile (what the fuck)?

\- we have a talk where I tell her my intentions and what is bothering me, she listens and gives me answers that do not fully satisfy me but are also not too awful and talks about what is bothering her. I understand most of her points and she is right with some arguments. We discuss things and she says we should just see where it is headed without forcing anything and we leave. Her body language is positive and she messages me when she gets home and the day after. Though as always responses are super late despite her being on the phone nonstop from what I believe.

**Question:**  
**Does this have a chance to become a serious relationship or am I hanging on to something that is hopeless because she doesnt seem too put as much effort into it as I do? Wouldnt someone who is interested in someone always some time to chat/phone or meet? It is just so confusing.**   
**I am so uncertain about her because I like her but her communication (time) is awful. I am sure that she would make me a better person and add value to my life but I do not know whether I can say the same for myself (adding value to her life).**

**Thoughts about this situation occupy my everyday life and I have been stressed about it for a few days.**

Been disappointed not to notice it having any impact other than my leg twitching has greatly subsided, but still having brain noise, procrastination and other effects. I had a review and increased to 40mg, but it didn’t arrive in time to take today (turned up 11:30 and decided that was too late to take) and I’m only getting 14 days at a time during titration.

By lunch time I was getting tired, then around 4pm I was so exhausted that I could barely stay awake, and had to go for a nap. I had an hour, woke up still very tired and had a bit of the shakes (which subsided after an hour or so). It was almost like I’d been eating bag loads of skittles and was sugar crashing (I did eat a flapjack at lunch but not usually big on sugary stuff).

I also had two cups of tea and a cup of coffee, which I’ve been limiting to just one cup of green tea on the days I’ve been on meds.

So is it possible that this is just down to no meds today? I don’t want to have to use meds every single day if I can help it. But equally I don’t want days I don’t to end up like that.

Jokes aside, i have a few questions id love answered.

1. When I auto steam the milk and do it on its maximum heat/froth setting, (tried medium too), when i pour the milk I only get the smooth milk not the froth coming out. If I pour all the milk in + froth its too milky and i lose the flavour of the shot. What am I doing wrong here, is the jug with the bambino suseceptible to only letting out the milk vs the froth or is my technique wrong?
2. Im not really sure whether im overfilling my basket. I started with 18g, but felt it was too close to the top of the basket. Im now doing 17g and the razor tool still takes off coffee. Not entirely sure the use of the razor tool if its always going to pull off coffee to the same level regardless of whether you do 17-20g? And by using it i no longer know my actual dose?
3. Is it worth upgrading my basket to an IMS 18-20g ? And if so can I use that with the stock portafilter?
4. Should the shower screen have coffee on it or not at all? Ive noticed mine has a little so not sure if thats a guideline towards knowing if im overfilling.

    Understand how I process my environment: I have a lot more demands for my attention because I take in about 8 times the sensory input as most people. So, at times I can seem distracted or may not make eye contact when I am listening to you. A good rule of thumb is that if I am near you, I am paying attention to you.  I may have sensory processing differences, so I experience noise, light, touch, and taste differently than most people.

    Understand my movement: When I rock or shift my stance, sit on the ground, or keep my hands busy with an activity, I can give my body the input it needs to feel grounded and calm.

    Sensitivity to touch: I want to connect with people, but hugs and touching may be difficult for me. If you offer your hand and I do not reach out, please do not feel slighted.

    Ways you can help us stay: My family wants connection within the Church community, but coffee hour settings with loud noises and bright lights are difficult for me. If noise-canceling headphones and sunglasses were provided, we might be able to stay longer and enjoy fellowship on days we forget to bring my personal headphones or sunglasses.

    Provide sensory play options: Socializing is easier for me when I can follow a predictable pattern with my body. It can help to have a sensory bin area or a table with fidget toys or sticker crafts where I can play alongside my peers.

    Understand my communication: I may vocalize or make sounds to express myself or calm myself if I do not have words to do so. I am simply communicating in the way I have available to me. Sometimes I use images or an iPad to communicate. This is often my voice and my way of engaging with you.

    Keep me safe: I may seek to elope from a room, as a “flight” response to sensory overload. I am not always aware of safety issues. Please don’t let me run outside or into the street.

    Get to know me: I want friends and connections like anyone else. Please talk to me as you would anyone, with kindness and respect. Spend time with me. Get to know me. I’m interesting and unique and fun, just like you!

    Be welcoming: Getting to church can be difficult because of transitions and additional needs, so my family has worked hard just to be here today. Please let them know that you’re happy we’re here.

    We are icons of Christ: I am created in God’s image. While the world may not accept this, my family and I long to be embraced as such by our church community. Please remember when you see me, you should see an icon of Christ.

Here's how,"Last October I was still suffering with my anal fissure and it had been over 2 years by that point. Unbeknownst to me I would get sick with a cold and begin taking 4g powder vitamin C in ascorbic acid form. Shortly after I also began taking 200ng powder magnesium glycinate. As the days went on I could feel the difference in my sphincter's ability to relax during my bowel movements and my spasms stopped completely. I could actually feel my body's ability to heal my fissure, whereas for the past 2 years I felt so sick.

I also used dermaplast with the blue cap right before a bowel movement to help desensitize and numb the area. In fact I still use it, but I think I can actually stop it because I have consistent bowel movements every single day now and consistent ability for my sphincter to stretch and evacuate my bowels.

Eventually I did increase to twice daily. I take the first dose (4g vitamin c, 200mg mag. Glycinate) after breakfast and I take the last one right before bed (same dose). So in one day I get 8g vitamin C and 400mg magnesium glycinate. I did work up to this, but only when I could tell that my bowels were use to the first initial dose.

I hydrate myself no more than average. In our house we have raw milk, juice (I only drink juice watered down with coconut water), tea, the occasional coffee and plain water. I vary these through each day, but I'm not drinking all of them in one day. I only drink the milk and water as a ""drink when thirsty"" sort of deal.

As far as vegetables go I eat fresh when we can, but they're usually canned. Fruit is also canned, and fresh when we can get it. We're also a meat and potatoes family, our beef and pork sourced from a farm, and chicken from the store. We're an ingredient family and we only consume seed oils or processed foods as a treat not daily. 

I'm basically explaining that constipation was never my initial issue, it all began 1 month after a pretty big surgery to remove endometriosis. However, magnesium glycinate with an adequate amount of hydration should help constipation.

Anyway, I hope this could help all of you beautiful people, and maybe even just one. Please ask me questions and I'll try to answer as well as I can. ",5,1745536245.0,AnalFissures,5,1.0,False

I moved in with my friend (female) and her husband. I have known her for many years and now that I am living with her it is clear that she has BPD. It is mot something I can be around any longer for my own well being. 

I moved here from out of state and there was no timeline and that's been understood. However, her moods and the way she is treating me is surreal. 

She was laid off from her job 2 years ago and didn't get an important job she interviewed for recently that was crucial to her financial stabiluty. She sill has some money left from her layoff or savings but I don't know how much.

Although we didn't have a set amount I would pay, I believe she truly is financially drowning or she is manipulating me or both. I've been here for 2 months and have paid 3/4 of her mortgage each month....3300 out of 4400. Yet Amazon comes here a lot. 

It's intetesting because I was hopeful she would be more emotionally regulated after I covered tjis ecpense but she seems to get mean shortly after. I have trauma so it isn't a healthy combo. 

Her partner of 15 years does't have a job and neither of them are even looking at part time jobs, lije it is beneath them or because I'm badically covering the mortage. 

I am focusung in the finances so much because I feel like I am holding it together financially for them and I am terrified of the response when I tell her I am moving. 

This past Saturday she gave me an ester basket after saying such nadty paddive aggresive comments. I told her I loved it mainly to keep her happy then the next morning she was vacuuming outside of my bedroom after I had not gotten home from work until after midnight then again the following night at 12am after I got home from work and had to be up and to work again at 5am. And she's stopped talking to me and she blocked me on facebook then told me it was avtech gliche. So much more. She lues so much and to keep the peace I act like I din't notice, even the vacuuming. She even put the end of the vacuum hose against my bedroom wall. It sounded like a drill at midnight. 

Again, so much mire, the suicide mentions and belittling me. I am wirking my ass off in a hospital ER. 

I am terrified of the ramifications of me telling her I am moving. Will she really lose her home..I don't know. But I do know that she will say she will and much more. It is a farm. The TV is on all night meaning she hadn't slept for a week. She literalky hides when I come home. If I pick up dinner for myself she makes snide remarks or even get a coffee. Yet Amazon is here at leadt a few times per week delivering orders for her. She even got her hair done then literally got made at me for coliring my hair at home and while I had the color in my hair, used the shower and I couldn't rinse my hair and this ruined it. Again, I could go on. She has offered mevfood with a smile, then makes sonething like frexh bread or kale chips and eats them in front of me without offering me a bite, after I just bought her food at the store because she said she had no money for food. 

Back to the initial quedtion, how do I tell her I am moving? I plan on lying and saying it is for work, saying I have been asked to move to a different hospital. Should I lie? Should I move (I can't move for 3 weeks) and not rell her? I would like to give her thst time to get at keadt a part time job somewhere and at the same time I am locking my bedroom doir at night after the vacuuming incidents. 

What should I expect and how should I go about it? She was gracious by offering me a place to stay after I relocated. I want to be fair but I want to take care of myself emotionally. And I will not give her any more money. 

Thank you!

    Be welcoming: Getting to church can be difficult because of transitions and additional needs, so my family has worked hard just to be here today. Please let them know that you’re happy we’re here.

    We are icons of Christ: I am created in God’s image. While the world may not accept this, my family and I long to be embraced as such by our church community. Please remember when you see me, you should see an icon of Christ.

1k765x1,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/1k765x1/i_smoke_crack_twice_a_week_you_stay_sober_every/,I smoke crack twice a week. You stay sober every day. Guess which one of us is winning?,"Let me break something down for the willfully average: not all drug use is created equal. Not everyone who smokes crack is a “crackhead.” That’s a word you use to simplify a world you don’t understand. I smoke crack twice a week. Like clockwork. Not out of addiction, not out of desperation, but because I’ve discovered something 99% of you never will: how to weaponize intensity.

Let me paint a picture.

I wake up at 5:12 a.m. I don’t need an alarm. My body just knows. I drink a glass of water (with electrolytes, obviously), I stretch, I thank God or the simulation or whatever runs this world, then I sit cross-legged in complete silence until I feel it’s time. Then I smoke crack. One or two hits. Not to get ""high."" I’m not chasing a feeling. I’m tuning my brain like a Formula 1 car before a race.

And then the day begins.

By 6:00 a.m. I’ve already reorganized my entire file system, built out a Notion template for the next five years of my life, cleaned the grout between every bathroom tile, and written three emails that get read like poetry.

You know what the average sober person is doing at 6:00 a.m.? Snoozing an alarm on a mattress that smells like anxiety and broken dreams. You stumble to the kitchen and think you’re a warrior because you made black coffee without sugar. That’s your peak. That’s the big flex for your day.

Meanwhile I’ve already conquered tasks you’ve been procrastinating for a year.

Let’s keep going.

The mailman walks by my apartment every morning. He’s got that defeated look in his eye. Like his soul left his body in 2009 and nobody told him. He moves like time is a punishment. I wave to him. He doesn’t wave back. I don’t blame him. He probably saw me through the blinds, shirtless, typing 160 WPM while doing calf raises and thought, “Why isn’t that me?” But he’ll never ask. Too much pride. Too little energy.

Cops drive by. I nod. I have nothing to fear. You think they’re scary? I’ve stared into the core of my psyche on a Tuesday afternoon while my oven made whispering noises. I’ve already made peace with chaos. A badge doesn’t scare me. A Glock doesn’t scare me. I've fought ego death with nothing but a cracked screen and Bluetooth jazz.

My neighbor is a sober guy. He drinks kombucha and listens to Joe Rogan. He meal preps. He’s got a vision board and a 401(k). He also has dead eyes. I asked him once what he thinks about when he’s alone. He said “usually just work stuff or fantasy football.” I almost cried. That’s it? That’s the entire inner world of the ""healthy"" man? No visions? No cosmic jokes? No wars between angels and intrusive thoughts?

You ever feel your cells vibrate like a symphony of pure intent? No? I have. Last Thursday. On crack.

I’ve had moments on this substance where time split open like a rotten fruit and I saw everything. Every lie, every truth, every reason we fear honesty. I’ve smoked crack and realized I was still in love with a girl from 6th grade, then laughed about it and rewired the emotional circuit live on the spot. Can kombucha do that? Can cold showers do that?

I doubt it.

I’m not saying you should smoke crack. In fact, most of you shouldn’t. You don’t have the structure, the ritual, the respect for power. You’re the type of people who drink six beers and text your ex like a feral animal. You can’t even handle McDonald’s responsibly. Crack would eat you alive. But me? I broke it down. I studied it. I conquered it. And now it serves me.

My brain is sharper than yours. My thoughts are faster. My fears are smaller. My output is massive. You fear “losing control.” I lost it once and realized there was nothing to fear in the first place.

So next time you judge a smoker like me, remember: you’re not better because you’re sober.
You’re just slower, duller, and probably still lying to yourself about why you wake up tired every day despite 8 hours of sleep.

Like, life has been rather smooth I could say for myself at least and while I don’t usually regard small happenings as a sign of big events to come.

Now what I’m about to say below all happened in a few days entirely.  

Suddenly my entire wooden desk which I have had for nearly 20 years has just broken into pieces with the middle drawer, my glasses which I take care of out just lost one of the parts that goes on the ear, it just popped off out of nowhere so I couldn’t see until the next day when I ordered new ones and had a temporary set. Earlier that day at work I come in no managers are in so I was assigned to someone else’s station during a super busy hour and had no time to stop and reorganize things that weren’t my property, so I quickly asked to move areas and as I left the area, suddenly the persons belongings fell on their own, like everything just got knocked down, I got yelled at my co worker despite always having a really good connection with them, never fighting. Things cleared up after I apologized and explained but the whole thing was WEIRD. Just a day ago I was sending a package to a friend of mine who I usually send a coffee to here and there to show them what I am trying, as they moved to another state for study. Usually everything works out completely fine, it gets delivered after a week or so but out of nowhere the courier got the wrong address in a completely different town and now my package might be gone.



My question to all of you is, has anything on this level happened to you all recently? Have you noticed anything odd going on that doesn’t usually occur.

i wanted to share a quick guide on how you can do this for less than the price of your daily coffee the tool i'm using my own inhouse tool which we've built ourselves to scrape e-commerce store data and guess what you can scrape unlimited data without breaking the bank

it's actually so affordable and easy to use just a few clicks and you're ready to go

for example if you're targeting stores in the apparel industry in the united states all you need to do is enter the details you want to scrape

whether it's shopify stores or woocommerce

the system will take care of the rest and give you the data you need you can choose specific revenue ranges for stores and it even lets you target active stores without the extra hassle in just a few minutes

i was able to pull up a list with 323019 stores from the united states and apparel industries

i downloaded the file which came with all the essential details domains country code city location merchant name rank categories tech used and even social media links and it all came in a neat organized file that saves me so much time and effort the best part is there’s no need for proxies or anything fancy just a simple tool that gives you unlimited access to the data you need to fuel your lead gen efforts",0,1745535817.0,LeadGeneration,3,0.25,False

- sleep mask, ear plugs, and travel blanket for flight
- change to non-wrinkle business casual outfit at airport
- bring face wipes
-  do make up and touch up hair and deodorant at airport 
- drink my body weight in coffee
- try to respectfully push any dinner suggestions for my first night to a later date

This is going to be a bit long, but I really need to get this off my chest.

I (27F) live with my partner (26F). We moved in together about a year ago and things were great. A few months after that, a very good friend of ours (23F) moved in with us. She had been living in a private student dorm (basically like a shared flat owned by someone who rents out rooms to students who didn’t get a spot in a university dorm, in our country, unis only have enough dorm rooms for about a quarter of their students, so most people either rent or end up in private dorms).

She was having a really rough time there because the owner was very controlling, gossiped about her with other tenants, and made some really hurtful comments based on her appearance (she’s a bit heavier and has some facial hair due to hormonal issues, and the owner assumed she “wanted to be a boy”). She used to vent to us a lot about how miserable she was, so in wanting to help her out, we told her she could move in with us as we had a spare room we mostly used for storage. She agreed but even after agreeing, she dragged out the move for weeks! When she finally did move in after we asked her a bunch of times if she was still planning on moving in, she slept on the couch and lived out of a suitcase for ages. We kept encouraging her to find a mattress or a bed on donation sites because neither one of us could afford a new bed for her and all she kept saying was that she will soon, but she didn’t. Eventually, my partner and I built her a bed frame from pallets and got her a mattress that a mutual friend wanted to get rid of. We even cleaned out the room and put up her Pride flag as a welcome since she couldn’t do that at the dorm and she didn’t even say a thank you, she just told us she “could’ve done it herself.”

We also set a few basic house rules: clean up after yourself, let us know if people are coming over, try not to let arguments go unresolved for more than three days etc. Nothing too strict if I’m being honest, or so I thought but she’s had something to complain about with every single one. She doesn’t get why she needs to tell us if someone’s coming over (she says in the dorm she never had to), and she constantly leaves half-finished cups of coffee everywhere. I’ve asked her nicely so many times to at least put those in the sink but she just doesn’t.

The latest issue: I helped her get a job at my workplace because she was always complaining about her old one but now it feels like she expects me to drive her to work regularly. At one point, she even asked if I could talk to my supervisor to coordinate our shifts so we could ride together. I really don’t want to do that, I already see her every day at home, the last thing I need is to see her 24/7! Public transport from our place to our job is awful if you don’t have a car, I get that. You have to do two or three bus changes and there’s also a long 20 minute walk up a hill so we talked once about her maybe moving closer to work, but she hasn’t brought it up since. At this point I’m honestly just hoping every day that she’ll tell us she found a place and is moving out next week.

I honestly feel so bad because I know she’s been through a lot and I really wanted to help but now I feel resentful and honestly just want my girlfriend and me to have our space back. I feel like I’m suffocating in our own home and I hate hate hate that!

Is anyone else dealing with something like this or am I just too dramatic and should I reflect on my behavior? Also how do you set boundaries when someone doesn’t seem to be doing anything malicious, but also just doesn’t seem to respect your space or is just waiting for things to be done to them rather than doing those things themselves and just complains about it..

Hopefully this makes sense because I’m at the end of my rope right now 😭😭",3,1745535612.0,roommates,1,1.0,False
