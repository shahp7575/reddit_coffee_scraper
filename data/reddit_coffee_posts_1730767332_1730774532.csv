I don’t know if sharing this will help me, but I need to get it off my chest. So here it goes.

A few weeks ago, I was searching for a part-time job during my summer in Croatia, just looking to make some extra cash without too much commitment. That’s when my friend David hit me up about an opening at a small, local museum tucked away in the old part of the city. He sounded way too excited, which made me wary.

“Come on, just give it a shot,” he urged. “It’s easy money. Last week, I made an extra grand just for staying an hour late!”

I shot back, “Great, but if this paycheck feels like cartel blood money, I’m out.”

David laughed, brushing off my sarcasm. “Stop being dramatic! Just meet me at the museum tonight at 8. Don’t be late, bozo!”

When I walked into the museum that evening, I felt a chill run down my spine. The dimly lit rooms had an eerie stillness, the air thick with the smell of dust and old wood. In the reception area, I found David slumped over, fast asleep in a chair.

“David!” I called, shaking his arm.

He jolted awake, groggy. “What? Who—?”

“Seriously? You’re sleeping on the job?”

“Chill out,” he grumbled, rubbing his eyes. “I was up late.”

“David, you need to get it together. Put your phone down before bed or something!”

“Okay, Dad,” he smirked, stretching. “But this place is... odd. The boss, Mr. Boris? He’s... well, he keeps to himself.”

I glanced around the reception area. “Mysterious, huh? What’s with all that caution tape on the first floor?”

David’s face turned serious. “Don’t mess with that. Just leave it alone.”

“Why? What’s behind it?”

“Trust me. It’s not worth it.”

I rolled my eyes, feeling a tingle of curiosity. “Doesn’t this all feel off to you?”

He sighed, running a hand through his hair. “Dude, it’s a museum. They’re all kind of weird.”

“Yeah, but this is different,” I insisted. “What’s behind the tape? What’s Mr. Boris hiding?”

David shrugged, trying to laugh it off. “Maybe he’s just protecting the good stuff.”

We both chuckled, but I felt a creeping unease settle over me.

“Alright, what’s next?” I asked, trying to shake off the feeling.

David cleared his throat, putting on a mock-serious face. “Now, we practice some security protocols.” He winked, but the humor felt forced.

“Sure, but first—coffee?” he said, glancing towards the coffee machine.

I raised an eyebrow. “You’re seriously thinking about coffee right now?”

“Hey, a guard needs his caffeine,” he replied, heading down the hall.

As his footsteps faded, an unsettling silence filled the room. I sat down in a nearby chair, feeling the tension tighten around me. I couldn’t shake the sensation that I was being watched.

The air felt thick, and then I heard it—a soft, almost liquid sound echoing from the back of the gallery. I turned, heart racing. “Just the roof leaking,” I muttered to myself, but doubt crept in.

As I stood to investigate, I noticed something strange behind the caution tape: an exact replica of the Mona Lisa. It was bizarre, almost out of place. The cloth covering it lay crumpled on the ground, smeared with a dark, inky substance.

“What the hell?” I whispered, creeping closer. My pulse quickened as I reached out to touch the damp cloth. A chill shot through me, like a ghostly breath of wind.

I stepped back, my breath hitching in my throat. The painting’s smile... it wasn’t right. It stretched unnaturally wide, her eyes glinting with an unsettling awareness. I blinked, trying to convince myself it was just a trick of the light.

But then, the smile morphed. It twisted into a grotesque grin that shouldn’t exist in a Renaissance painting. Her hair shifted, strands flowing like fire, her face becoming angular and twisted.

“What is happening?” I screamed silently in my mind. I staggered back, feeling my foot slide on the inky residue beneath me. I tore my gaze away, desperately trying to catch my breath.

And then, a slithering sound echoed behind me, breaking the oppressive silence. My heart raced as I spun around, half-expecting to see David. But the hall was empty, the shadows swallowing every trace of light.

I turned back to the painting. She was gone.

In her place was only the darkened canvas, the smile lingering in my mind. Something was very wrong, and I was utterly alone.",1,1730774344.0,u_NocturnKeeper_Offic,0,1.0,False

About 1 week ago I put a lock on my locker and never had problems with it until today. A couple of the staff know I'm houseless and have never once mentioned to me about the stupid 24 hour locker policy. Apparently even if you have a lock on your locker, they will still cut it and empty it out along with all other lockers every 24 hours. Never once anyone said that to me. 

I come in later than normal today to my surprise my cut lock in half and empty locker. I go to the front desk and they told me they kept the towel and shoes but threw away my shampoo and body wash :( they were brand new full bottles too

My mom has been living with relatives, namely her brother and his wife. Their daughter just got married, and they have been kinda twisting her arm to sell the house as soon as possible. They used to respond to my texts and she did too more frequently but since I voiced my opinion that my mother keep her disgusting but beloved home to finally fix it up and sell it at a worthy price (invest ~250k, home is worth easily .5mil if sold in good condition), it has basically been radio silence. 

Don't get me wrong. It's weirdly vindicating to watch this unfold. I have an inkling they want any money faster so they can take it to pay for my cousin's wedding. They can vilify us and sit on the high horse while my mom's memory and free agancy wanes further. She doesn't even remember much for more than a few minutes and has been struggling with the concept that she can no longer control the situation. The city has seen it and it is either sell it to someone who will fix it, fix it ourselves, or condemnation, seizure and probably fines. I have a feeling they don't want to hear my opinion especially because it is the same as my dad's, and they despise him. Just for him divorcing my mom... But she made us grow up in squalor! and now all those precious belongings she cared about more than us will go to making my cousin's sweet life even sweeter!! My dad brought me some of my residual belongings from my spaces in the house. I think of stuff everynday I want to reclaim from the mess. I think of all the times I tried to clean or offered financial assistance for services to fix the many problems in the house (it is condemnable and everything that was there REEKED of mold for weeks after removal...heck, when my fiancé and I first left our stay in that house our coffee maker looked like a petri dish when we brought it into the heat and light of day from the basement!). I live states away from all that and have kids of my own now that I honestly don't care if my mom ever gets to meet. Some days I want to forgive her and then I remember that I actually laughed out loud when I heard the house had burnt. Apparently 1 in every 3 deaths from fire in America are in/result of hoarded homes. 

I mean, it IS a fitting end. It's bittersweet, and ironic in a million ways. I guess I am just glad that house won't cast a shadow over us any longer by physical presence and maybe we can all move on and forget how this XL sized token of neglect mouldered away our souls as children.

Hey fellow devs! I just wanted to share my experience of building the game with AI, along with some brutal honesty about indie dev life.

It all started with me procrastinating by listening to Antoine van der Lee's podcast (anyone else learning Swift from his blog since forever?). They were discussing this 2-2-2 approach: validate in 2 hours, prototype in 2 days, release in 2 weeks. In my infinite wisdom, since I have a bit of free time I decided ""Hey, why not build 5 apps by the end of 2024?"" Yeah, I know, I know...

# The Idea

Was binging Netflix's ""Devil's Plan"" - a show where contestants compete in various mental challenges (great show btw), and there was this word association game that looked fun. Couldn't find anything similar on the App Store, so classic dev move - ""I'll build it myself!""

# The AI Experiment

Decided to go all-in with AI. Although I've been using an unofficial Copilot extension for XCode for quite a while, for this project, I decided to use primarily Cursor with Claude Sonnet model and Sweetpad extension, and holy - it actually worked decently well. Gave it the game rules, and 15 minutes later had a working prototype with all the views, models, game logic separated into different files. Sure, it looked like it was designed by a backend developer (first screenshot), but it worked...kinda. It took me the remaining 7 days to iterate, adjust, tweak and build on top of it to bring it to a production level.

# The Reality Check

Current user base:

1. Me
2. Also me (on simulator)
3. My partner (bless her)
4. My mom (who's still trying to figure out how to sign in)
5. Probably the App Store reviewer

But hey, that's 5 users more than yesterday! 😅

# The Tech Side

* SwiftUI + MVVM + semi-clean architecture (because we're all proper developers here)
* Firebase: Authentication, FireStore, RemoteConfigs (because what's an indie app without Firebase?)
* Mixpanel (to track those massive user numbers)
* RevenueCat (I know, overkill for my 0 purchases so far)

# Working with AI - The Good, Bad, and Weird

Think of AI as that junior dev who sometimes has brilliant ideas and sometimes makes you question everything. It's like pair programming, but your partner doesn't drink your coffee or judge your variable names.

Good stuff:

* Built a prototype in 15 minutes (would've taken me 2 days of overthinking)
* Created a tag cloud view in seconds (saved me from a StackOverflow deep dive)
* Actually decent UI suggestions (I kept most of the initial UI)

The ""interesting"" parts:

* Jumping between Xcode and Cursor like a caffeinated kangaroo
* AI: ""Here's your feature!"" Me: ""Cool, but can you make it... actually work?""
* Made a huge backlog of ""nice-to-have"" features (that I'll totally get to...someday)

# Honest Lessons Learned

1. Building with AI is surprisingly fun. It's like having a very eager intern who occasionally writes better code than you.
2. Shipped in 7 days (about 40-60 hours). Could I have done it faster without AI? Maybe, but would I have enjoyed it as much? Nope!
3. The app icon is... well, it's a devil created in Midjourney with ""WORDS"" slapped on in Photoshop. Design is my passion™️

# The App Itself

* No ads, no subs (because I don't expect any profit, it's just for fun)
* Just pure, simple word gaming with minimal UI design
* Available now on the App Store. You can search **Devil's Words Association Game**. Or here is a [link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/devils-words-association-game/id6737246063?pt=2248795&ct=reddit.iosprogramming.05112024&mt=8)

# What's Next?

If I somehow hit 1000 downloads (currently at 5, so... getting there!), I'll add some fancy animations and features from my massive backlog. Until then, I'm moving on to app #2 of my 5-app challenge. So stay tuned.

Would love your feedback:

* How far did you get before rage quitting or getting dead bored and deleting the app?
* How does the UI/UX fill? Is the UI too minimal or just minimal enough?
* Any features you'd want to see?
* Should I give up and do web dev instead? 😅... Nah, I've been an iOS developer since iOS4, I may think about quiting on iOS49.

# The Philosophical Bit

Is AI replacing developers? Nah...or maybe... NAAAH! Is it making development more fun and slightly less painful? Absolutely. It's like having a rubber duck that actually talks back and sometimes writes code better and faster than you do.

Let me know if you want to hear more about specific parts of the development process, or try the app and tell me where you got stuck. Also accepting suggestions for a less terrible app icon! 🙏",3,1730773933.0,iOSProgramming,0,0.8,False

","Below is an article I wrote in which I explained where in Greece I think you should visit, how much time I think you should spend at each of these recommended destinations and the order in which to visit these destinations. Feel free to direct message me if you need help.



Formally introduced as the “Cradle of Western Civilization,’ yet commonly known for its incredibly alluring and diverse islands, Greece offers a healthy balance between history and heritage on one hand and Mediterranean-style leisure and partying on the other. Greece is home of architectural jewels such as Corfu Town, Chania in Crete, Rhodes Town and the Cycladic Islands. The country also features a seemingly endless array of archeological treasures (e.g. the Acropolis and Parthenon), striking monasteries (especially Meteora and Mount Athos), plenty of hiking (e.g. Samaria Gorge), and even skiing (especially Arachova) opportunities.



As for those who simply want to vacation, Greece has long been a favorite among families and revelers alike. Greece has the twelfth longest shoreline in the world and neither tourists nor locals waste an opportunity to have some fun in the sun. Of course, there are plenty of islands as well as areas along the mainland’s coast that provide for a quiet stay. However, if looking for some of Southern Europe’s most vibrant beach bars and nightlife, then Greece will be an ideal destination for you. To describe Greece in only one sentence, it is a country that cherishes its past, lives for the present, and plans as if only to party.



Days 1-3: Start your trip to Greece in Rhodes. 3 days suffice, including the early morning arrival from abroad, ideally from Fethiye, Turkey. Fethiye is only a 1.5-hour boat ride away. Rhodes Town is a great base from which to explore the island. Renting a car is necessary.



A medieval town protected by fortification and graced by a maze of streets featuring inviting restaurants, cafés and shops, the UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the beautiful island capital that is Rhodes Town - an architectural gem of the Aegean Sea. Other treasures of this fairly populace and self-sustaining island include the village of Lindos and its acropolis, castles, archeological remains, rocky and scenic mountains, exotic beaches, and clear and calm waters along the southern coast.



Taken as a whole, Rhodes successfully balances its heritage with being a tourist-friendly and relatively well-organized destination. Noteworthy, however, is that the northern coast has given way to package tourism. At least in July, and especially August when tourists pack the island, this area is best known for its resorts, windsurfing activities, and hot-and-heavy nightlife. Ultimately, Rhodes is what you want it to be: a paradise for partygoers, a retreat for families, and/or an island home of rich culture and well-preserved traditions.



Day 4: Make a daytrip via a 1.5-hour boat ride to Symi. This island has become a haven for tourists from abroad, especially from the United Kingdom and Italy. The influx of tourists has led to the restoration of a great number of homes, many of which were destroyed during World War II.





Day 5: Take a quick and early-morning flight from Rhodes to the town of Heraklion, Crete. Renting a car is necessary. Heraklion is home of an archeological site called Knossos. Next, take a 1.5-hour drive to the village of Matala, home of great beaches and caves. Lastly, take a 1-hour and 45-minute drive to the charming town of Rethymno. There you can do a little sightseeing, have a nice dinner and enjoy some evening entertainment. The ride to the town of Chania from Rethymno takes about 1 hour. While on Crete Island, base yourself in Chania.



Missing from today’s itinerary is a stop in Plakias, also home of some great beaches. If you really want to squeeze Plakias in, then from Matala you could take a 1.5-hour drive to reach it. You could then go from Plakias to Rethymno via a 45-minute drive.



Day 6: As a daytrip, take a 1.5-hour drive to Samaria Gorge. There you can do some hiking. Afterwards, return to Chania and do an evening stroll around town.



Day 7: Make a daytrip to the western side of Crete. Take a 45-minute drive to Kissamos, followed by a 1-hour boat ride to Imeri Gramvousa. This small island hosts the remains of a Venetian fort as well as of buildings left behind by Cretan insurgents who were compelled to live as pirates during the Greek War of Independence. After exploring the sites, relaxing at the beach, and returning to the mainland, take a 1-hour drive to the island of Elafonisi. When the weather is fine it is possible to walk from the mainland to the island through the shallow water. The drive from Elafonisi back to Chania takes about 1.5 hours.



Day 8: Explore the charming town of Chania.



Perhaps most atmospheric at night when the many bars and romantic restaurants light up along the shores and under the stars, Chania is home of a charming port that serves some of the tastiest food in all of Greece. Surrounding this historic town are streets containing boutique hotels, as well as shops that commonly illustrate Crete’s fascination with artisanship. Venetian in style yet complimented by Ottoman features, Chania is not only Crete’s most architecturally attractive destination but it is also the ideal location in Crete to use as a base from which to explore the central and western parts of the island. If you seek an authentic experience, then you should lodge in the nightlife-rich old town rather than the outlying beach areas where the package tourists tend to stay.



Days 9-11: Take a 2-hour speed boat ride from Heraklion, Crete to Santorini. 3 days of exploring the island suffice, including the afternoon arrival from Heraklion. Renting a car or motorbike is necessary. On the third day make sure to include a visit via a quick ferry ride to the volcanic island of Nea Kameni.



Whitewashed and pastel-colored cubic buildings and blue-domed churches seemingly pile onto one another, cling onto the cliff-side caves of a caldera to form a dramatic landscape and striking views in what is one of the most unique destinations on earth. Especially in the villages of Thira and Oia, one can wander through a labyrinth of narrow and stone-paved alleyways filled with seasonally vibrant taverns and cafes as well as boutique shops and hotels. In these very same alleyways, you can find some pretty vibrant nightlife in the summertime.



Cycladic in style yet complimented by some neoclassical elements, Santorini is every photographer’s fantasy. With its villages perched several hundreds of feet above water, adding to this volcanic island’s allure is a stunning and world renowned-sunset, best viewed from Oia. Now throw into the mix locally produced and internationally acclaimed wines, scuba diving activities, archeological remains, and beaches with sand or pebbles made of solidified lava of various colors (e.g. Red Beach). Suddenly you have what is one of the most romanticized - and unsurprisingly visited - islands in all the Mediterranean.



Days 12-13: Take a 2-hour speed boat ride from Santorini to Paros. 2 days of exploring the island suffice, including the early morning arrival from Santorini. Renting a car or motorbike is necessary.



Paros looks and feels exactly like a quintessential Greek island: a maze of blue and white buildings packed with all kinds of shops, romantic restaurants dotted along the calm and clear sea, stars shining from far above, and music that makes reality temporarily forgotten – and that’s just a description of the old town. Perhaps even more of a draw is the beach scene. Although not as world renowned as nearby Mykonos, Paros is no less enticing. Whether you seek rest and relaxation or whether you enjoy wondering aimlessly, this relatively small island would be a great choice for you.



Days 14-15: Take a 1-hour speed boat ride from Paros to Mykonos. 2 days of exploring the island suffice, including the early morning arrival from Paros. Renting a car or motorbike is necessary. If you have extra time on your hand, then consider visiting via a 30-minute boat ride the ruins in the island of Delos.



Now famed for seasonally hosting some of the best beach parties and nightlife in all the Mediterranean as well as featuring an exciting fashion scene combined with stylish bars, restaurants and shops, what initially put Mykonos under the international spotlight is its clear and calm waters and quintessential Cycladic architecture: whitewashed cubic buildings, a labyrinth of narrow and stone-paved alleyways, and numerous little churches dotted around town. Although Mykonos is one of Greece’s chicest and most visited destinations, the island usually only feels overcrowded in July, especially in August, and sometimes in September. Visit Mykonos virtually any other time of the year and experience an island as authentically Greek as anywhere “off the beaten path.”



Day 16: Make a daytrip via a 1-hour boat ride to the island of Syros.



The town of Ermoupoli stands on a naturally amphi-theatrical site, with neo-classical buildings, old mansions and white houses cascading down to the harbor. The City Hall is where Miaoulis Square lies, ringed with cafes and with seating areas under palm trees. Ano Syros is the second town of Syros and was built by the Venetians at the beginning of the 13th century. Ano Syros maintains a medieval atmosphere. Innumerable steps between narrow streets and houses with colored doors lead to the top of the town. The Catholic cathedral of Saint George dominates Ano Syros. From the cathedral visitors have a panoramic view of the neighboring islands of Tinos, Delos, Mykonos, Paros, Andros and Naxos.



Day 17: Take an early morning, 4-hour speed boat ride from Mykonos to Athens. Only spend that same day exploring the capital, with the key attractions being the ancient citadel of Acropolis and its museum, the Hellenic Parliament building, a flea market called ‘Monastiraki’ and the Plaka neighborhood.



Day 18: Make an early morning daytrip from Athens to an archeological site called Delphi via a 3-hour drive or an organized bus tour. The trip is a bit fatiguing but is still the best option. Ideally, it would be nice to relocate to Delphi and a couple of days later head north. In reality, this is complicated, that is, unless you rent a car.



Days 19-20: Take a 5-hour bus or preferably train ride from Athens to Kalabaka, home of an Eastern Orthodox monastery complex site called Meteora. 2 days suffice, including the afternoon arrival from Athens.



One of the largest and most impressive Eastern Orthodox complexes in all of Greece, Meteora is home of stunning monasteries perched onto surreal-looking and seemingly unapproachable sandstone rock pillars (there are steps).  You will need a full day to visit all six monasteries. Note: some of them may be closed depending on when you go. Make sure to begin your day bright and early. Majestic Meteora is a place known to put visitors in touch with both nature and spirituality. Those who wish to stay near to the complex commonly base themselves in Kalabaka.



Days 21-23: Although you could use public buses, it is best to rent a car and take a 2.5-hour drive to Igoumenitsa. From this port town take a 1.5-hour boat ride to the island of Corfu. Including the afternoon arrival from Igoumenitsa, 3 days suffice, one of which to do some sightseeing in the town itself and the rest to explore the island. Renting a car is necessary.



Venetian in appearance yet mostly dating from the neoclassical British period, the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Corfu Town is characterized by its palaces, churches, maze of narrow and stone-paved streets, squares, seashore promenade, trendy restaurants and cafes, and its two imposing castles that provide clear views of it all. What’s more, the town is the capital of a small and mountainous island that features verdant scenery, exotic beaches, and clear waters. Seasonally popular Corfu is otherwise known for exceptional nightlife.



Corfu became one of the first-visited islands during Greece’s tourism boom in the 1960s. Although areas of Corfu fell to mass commercialism and overdevelopment, fortunately the island still provides many natural and unspoiled charms. Package tourists tend to lodge outside of the capital. If you are seeking an authentic experience, then you should find accommodation in the old town. Here is where you are likely to meet some of the most cultured and friendly islanders in all of Greece.



Day 24: Make a daytrip from Corfu to the islands of Paxos and nearby Antipaxos via a 1.5-hour boat ride. The west coast of Paxos is dominated by steep white, chalky cliffs that are greatly eroded at sea level. Paxos harbors many 'blue caves', which can be explored on launches departing from Gaios. Antipaxos is famous for its wine as well as for two of the finest sand beaches in the Ionian Sea.



Day 25: Take a quick flight to Thessaloniki. 1 day suffices as long as you arrive early enough from Corfu. Rent a car at the airport. Thessaloniki isn’t as popular for its architecture as it is for its distinct culture, local cuisine, and incredible nightlife scene. If you want to experience big city Greece at its most authentic, then head to the country’s second largest city.



Day 26: Make a daytrip to popular beaches located less than 25 kilometers south of Thessaloniki: Perea, Agia Triada, and Asprovalta.



Day 27: Make a daytrip via a 2.5-hour drive to Mount Athos, a mountainous peninsula that is home of twenty striking Eastern Orthodox monasteries. Head for Ouranoupolis, from where early morning boat trips depart. Many tourists simply do a one-day boat trip excursion because a permit is needed to enter the area. How quickly the permit is granted varies greatly from days to months. The other thing to consider is while men are allowed onto the land with a permit, women are denied access altogether.



My girlfriend at the time and I decided to relocate to a village closer to Ouranoupolis rather than make a daytrip from Thessaloniki. The day we had arrived, most hotels and bed & breakfast establishments were fully booked. We had not booked a room in advance. I went to a travel agency to seek help. An agent linked me up with a local who showed me a photo of his hotel. My girlfriend and I went to his place and were unpleasantly surprised. It was his mom’s home. The place had absolutely nothing to do with the photo this guy showed me. I don’t know why I went inside to have a look at his place, but I just did. He showed us both his personal room and his sister’s. He said that my girlfriend and I could sleep in the bed with him or his sister. The guy was nuts - but hilarious in his own bizarre way. My girlfriend and I finally found a family bed & breakfast.



The next problem, the next day, involved a boat cruising along Mount Athos’ coastline also being full. We tried to get on, hoping for a last-minute cancellation. Not only did we not get on, but even people who had paid for tickets were denied entry. The company had overbooked. Since we still wanted to do the tour that same day, our only option was to embark upon another boat from a port approximately 1 hour away.



Taxis were too expensive. A travel agent I met had an acquaintance drive us for a lower amount. This guy was nuts, even worse than the guy who wanted me to sleep with his sister. He kept smoking, drinking coffee, and directly looking at us rather than on the road as he was talking nonstop. I almost begged him to stay focused. He said that he had a drunk-driving accident some years prior, as if that would make me feel like we weren’t going to crash. He told me not to worry, as he knew the roads using his eyes, ears, and heart. He made absolutely no sense whatsoever. Thank God we made it to the port safely. We got onto the boat and did a great tour.



Not Included in the Greece Itinerary



Solely due to logistics, not included in the itinerary is a visit to Monemvasia.



Uninterrupted by modern structures, Peloponnese’s own Monemvasia is a partially fortified and charming village that clings onto a relatively high and rocky mountain. This natural landmark is sprinkled with rather colorful and diverse flowers, is romantically illuminated at night, and offers great views of the old medieval town. No less attractive are the clean, clear, and calm waters running along Monemvasia and far beyond. If all that isn’t enough, thanks to its location within the agricultural heartland of this historic nation, Monemvasia is home of some of the Mediterranean's richest cuisine - wines, seafood, vegetables, and fruits. Near the rocky mountain, and right across the bridge, is a “new town,” where local dishes are best enjoyed while dining along the pebbly beaches. Almost anyone who visits this underrated destination will quickly discover that it ranks among Greece’s finest.



Also not included in the itinerary is the island of Milos, which boasts the most beautiful beaches in the region. It is highly recommended you visit Milos after Santorini and before Paros. Milos is a 2.5-hour boat ride away from Santorini and a 3.5-hour boat ride away from Paros. It is recommended you spend 2 full days in Milos. Rent a car. Sleep at a hotel near to the port.



First head to a beach called Paliochori. There you should start a boat ride along the southern coastline. Highlights include the beaches at Agia Kiriaki, Tsigrado, Firiplaka, Provatas, Kleftiko and Sikia. After the boat ride, head to a beach called Thiorichia. There you can have breathtaking views of the coastline. The following day, the first destination should be the village of Klima. There you can see cute homes built right along the coastline. Next, take a 5-minute drive to a catacombs archeological site. The guided tour there takes around 15 minutes. After this tour, go by foot to the nearby ancient amphitheater followed by foot to the nearby church overlooking the town.



Next, take a 10-minute drive to a beach called Firopotamos. It is recommended you simply have a look and do not go swimming yet. Next, take a 5-minute drive to a beach called Mantrakia. It is recommended you purchase lunch at the restaurant there. After your meal, take a 10-minute drive to a beach called Papafragas. There you have a great viewpoint of the coastline. Next, take a 5-minute drive to a beach called Alogomandra. It is recommended you swim there for about 15 minutes. Next, drive to a beach called Sarakiniko. This is the greatest beach of them all in Milos. It is recommended you spend a couple of hours there. After Sarakiniko, take a 10-minute drive to the village of Plaka. There you should take a 15-minute hike to a viewpoint overlooking the village. It is from this viewpoint you are to watch the sunset.



Also not included in the itinerary are the islands of Lefkada and Zakynthos. If you wish to add them, it is recommended to do so after visiting Corfu and before visiting Thessaloniki. From Corfu, take a 6-hour boat ride to Lefkada. After Lefkada, take a 7-hour boat ride to Zakynthos. After Zakynthos, take a flight to Thessaloniki. Lefkada and Zakynthos are both known for their beaches, which may be the nicest in all of Greece. You will need to rent a car to explore both of these islands.



For exploring Zakynthos, visit the island in this specific order:



1. Banana Beach (have a quick look)

2. Keri Beach Viewpoint

3. Shipwreck Beach Viewpoint (near to Saint George Monastery)

1gjwdtg,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1gjwdtg/zoologist_perfumes_34_samples_and_short_reviews/,Zoologist Perfumes: 34 samples and short reviews,"I love Zoologist for its intentions and its vision. They make beautiful, thoughtful, unique and interesting fragrances. There is something for everyone in this house, and I can’t recommend enough that you seize the opportunity to sample as many of their fragrances that you can. One thing that I needed to adjust to was the use of incense in many of these fragrances. Be prepared for that and you might fall in love with these!
Performance key: weak < acceptable (4-6hrs) < adequate (6-7hrs) < strong (8 hrs) < godly (9+hrs)

Beaver (maple)
Solid opening with a pronounced maple note on the top. Dry down is green, grassy and earthy. The vetiver is pronounced with this one. A bit mossy as well. No sweetness nor ozonic notes to balance out this green and earthy fragrance. Performance is adequate. It’s a 6.5/10 for me.

Snowy owl
Light, airy, slightly floral (lily of the valley), not very animalic. Pronounced mint note on top. Also a green vegetal note in there, reminiscent of nautica voyage (cucumber?). Very balanced and interesting. Unisex. Dry down is a bit ozonic and sunscreeny, somewhat like sailing day replica by Margiela. Performance is adequate. Artful in its execution, although it’s not really for me. 6.5/10

Panda
Top 5 of the house for me. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful dirty jasmine note that smells intoxicating on my skin. Slightly sweet, floral and very strong performer. It radiates and lasts 8+ hours. Artfully balanced, floral and unisex. I guess some would call it a well-made “oriental” style fragrance. 9/10 for me. Highly considering a bottle.

Hyrax
By far the most challenging of the entire house for me. It’s the strongest of the animalic frags. It smells strongly of civet and barnyard notes, with a dry, stony note that heightens the strength of the funkiness. I can’t really see anybody pulling this one off. I’ll keep the sample as a gag scent for the homies to sniff because it’s so unique. 10/10 for its unmitigated gall, but a 1/10 in terms of overall desirability and wearability. The performance is godly. I’ll smell remnants of this on my arm after 30+ hours. 

Rabbit
A delightful and artistic gourmand. Beautifully nutty, sweet and delicious though not in a conventional sense. Most gourmands smell cakey, vanilic and sickeningly sweet, but this is very nutty, not too sweet, and also has a faint carrot note. It’s very versatile and I like it a lot. It leans feminine. Performance is adequate. 7.5/10 

Camel
Another one of my favorites. Strong animalic barn notes in the mid, with warm, dry spices in the base that are seductive and beautiful. The oud accentuates the barn smell but it works so well with the bold spices. Dry down is gorgeous and feels altogether different from the top and mid. It combines a traditional, more middle Eastern-feeling fragrance with some more animalic notes. Performance is strong. 9/10 contemplating a bottle since I have nothing like this in my collection.

Bat
Probably my favorite. It’s a funky fruity top that smells like hot berries starting to go bad. It’s a little leathery and dark, perfect for an evening fragrance. Somehow it’s masculine but flirty and seductive. It’s not too sweet either. Dry down is somehow fougere and undeniably masculine. Performance is acceptable, less than I like, maybe lasts 6 hours. 9/10 might have to get a bottle of this.

Rhinocerous
Deeply masculine, leathery and boozy (whiskey) with a green, grassy vetiver note. Dry down does not fit my skin chemistry, but I can see some people really liking it. It’s odd, the leather and booze make it feel evening, but the grassy makes it feel spring and daytime. This is the opposite of a light freshy. Performance is strong. 5/10

Penguin
This one is really fascinating from the sensory aspect. It smells like snowy air. Not as cooling as snowy owl, but I can’t describe it any other way than that it just smells like melting snowy air. I’m not sure about how this performs, I feel like it is somewhat weak on performance. 8/10 how did they do this?

T-Rex
Really well done and deeply true to its name. Smoke, ash, leather, metallic blood. Deeply spiced with frankincense, masculine, spicy, mysterious yet dominating. Ideal for evenings and cool weather. Not super date night worthy unless you’re naturally bold and not flirty. Performance is godly. 8/10 very cool frag.

Sloth 
This is an interesting one. It’s deeply green, and somewhat…medicinal? It’s very non-linear and the dry down smells like a clean and somewhat fresh frag, oddly enough. I like this one a lot. Performance is acceptable. 8/10

Bee
Everyone loves this one but it’s so not for me. Deeply incensey, floral honey and sweet. Drydown smells like Catholic Church service and old ladies and fermenting sugar. This is one of those examples of how some of the zoologist fragrances have too much incense in some of their fragrances for my taste. Performance is godly. 4/10 

Moth
This one is so interesting, and, to me, so unlikable. It’s got all the qualities of old moth balls and dust. The clove, nutmeg and cumin with iris is such a strange and unique combo. It smells like a musty suit found at the bottom of an estate sale with some sweetness on top. It’s really cool though. Performance is strong. It doesn’t smell nearly as sweet as I’ve heard other reviewers say of it. 3/10

Squid
Oddly warm spicy to my nose. I’m not sure I can really detect a squid ink note. Almost like an unsweetened angels share? It’s nice and I see the appeal, but the dry down is a bit one note for me. It doesn’t make me think of squid at all if I’m being honest. Performance is strong. 5.5/10

Seahorse
This one is nice. It’s somehow watery yet also airy/ozonic. It’s also floral with an unmistakable neroli note. It reminds me a little bit of sailing day by Margiela with a twist of Tom Ford Neroli Portofino. If you like snowy owl, you might enjoy this one as well. Dry down becomes a bit powdery which is not my favorite. The floral accord is lovely though. Performance is adequate. 7.5/10

Tiger
This one is interesting. It’s kind of similar to Terre dhermes in my opinion, but grassier and greener with less citrus, with a sweeter and more floral opening. I love the vetiver and jasmine in this one, but performance was weak on my skin. If I didn’t already have Terre dhermes, I’d consider a bottle. 8/10

Macaque (yuzu)
This is a beautiful, soft fougere, barbershop fragrance. The fuzzy and soft, relaxing hinoki wood note is gorgeous and a relaxing touch to a traditional oakmoss and hydrocarbonic aerosol fragrance. The yuzu is short lived, unfortunately. Dry down is masculine and safe smelling. Performance is acceptable. 7/10

Macaque (Apple)
Virtually identical to macaque yuzu, but with a yummy, sweet apple note right on top. It lasts for about an hour on my skin as well before it dries down to another classic barbershop, shaving cream fougere. I love fougeres but I have a ton of them and can buy them for super cheap. This is a little more flirty though with the fruity top note. Performance is acceptable. 7.5/10

Dodo (jackfruit edition)
This is exactly what a classic fougere smells like. Shaving cream, through and through, but with a tiny hint of baby powder. Similar to macaque yuzu but it projects more and is a little bit spicier. The fermenty jackfruit top note is awesome but short lived. Clean and masculine. Very likable and unobjectionable. Dare I say…somewhat uninteresting for a niche frag? I might catch heat for that. It’s still beautiful and well made. Performance is adequate. 7.5/10 as a fougere lover, I just have way too many fougeres and fougere-adjacent fragrances to buy this one.

Northern cardinal
This is beautiful. It’s fruity, floral and cedar all in one delightful fragrance. The oakmossy, cedar finish with the more feminine, fruity top makes this unique and unisex. I haven’t smelled anything with this profile before. My wife and I both really like this one. It’s very versatile and could be used throughout all seasons. Performance is acceptable. 8.5/10 you could twist my arm to get a bottle of this

Elephant
Very green and unisex. Grassy, leafy on the top with a smooth, slightly sweet coconut dry down. This one is likeable, not too animalic of any, and is also very versatile. The incense is pronounced in this one and can be jarring at first if you’re not familiar with fragrances with incense. Performance is acceptable and the dry down is smooth. 7/10 

King cobra
This one smells like another masculine, barbershop fougere. It smells a bit like arrid xx aerosol and a little bit of Armani code, but without the overt sweetness and a hearty note of vetiver to make it interesting. I can see an older gentleman (45+) feeling nostalgic and liking this one. Very middle of the road for me. As a man, I think I could wear it and get through the day without turning too many heads. It’s well-made and longevity is there. Performance is adequate. 7/10

Koala 
Holy eucalyptus! This borders on medicinal with the strength of green eucalyptus in the opening. It’s only amplified by the menthol notes as well. I like this one as it’s really interesting, yet I feel somewhat confused by it. It has traditional fougere (oakmoss) and traditional “oriental” notes (vanilla), yet somehow it works out better than I imagined it would. The dry down is smooth and creamy with the vanilla. Performance is acceptable, and it’s very non linear. Solid 7.5/10 someone will love this one.

Dragonfly
Absolutely gorgeous and interesting. To me it smells like a dewdrop in a fantasy movie. Deeply aquatic, floral, green and fresh. Somewhat melon-ey as well. Performance is adequate. I love this one and want my wife to love it so that I can smell it on her. 9/10

Chameleon
It’s a HARD NO for me. It’s triggering. You might love this if you love Tom Ford F*cking Fabulous, but to me it’s a deeply unlikeable smell of baby wipes with funky diaper bin on top. I didn’t dislike it as much the first time I tried it, but the 2nd time, it resonated very poorly with me. This is a deeply opinionated take. It’s probably not as bad or as divisive as I find it, but I can’t get past my emotional reaction toward it. I like some more animalic fragrances but the fresh florals mixed with this one are so unsettling. Performance is adequate. 2/10 no no no.

Nightingale
Oooooooo, this is pretty. I normally am not a rose/oud enjoyer, but this is nice on the opening. Floral and dark with the oud touch. Some might find this one objectionable as it is retro feeling and oud can be divisive. Dry down is a little mothbally or dry and musty. This feels ideal for evenings. It has a mysteriousness to it that I find enjoyable. Performance is adequate and nonlinear.  7.5/10

Hummingbird
This is beautiful. It’s like diving into a bowl of fruit punch. Super fruity and sweet on the top. I grew up in a place where honeysuckle grows wild in the spring, and this has a GORGEOUS honeysuckle note in there that I’m in love with. It’s nothing revolutionary, but I also have a soft spot for hummingbirds, so the marketing is working on me. Performance is acceptable, suitable for day/spring.  8/10 really enjoy this.

Cockatiel
This is unlike anything I’ve smelled before. It’s floral forward, powdery and solar. I do not detect the champagne in this one too much. Maybe the vanilla and rhubarb mixing together make an accord that I’m so unfamiliar with. The first time I smelled this, I almost thought it smelled like new furniture or like drywall. I can’t think of any other way to explain it. Maybe that doesn’t make any sense. Performance is acceptable and it’s versatile to wear during the day, regardless of season. 6.5/10 interesting but maybe not for me.

Musk deer
This is a nice barbershop fougere in my opinion. Slightly animalic but not overpowering. Smooth and slightly sweet. I’m usually very challenged with oud and rose fragrances, but this one is blended in a way that is very palatable to me. The creamy sandalwood and jasmine smooth this musky fragrance perfectly. Surprisingly this one doesn’t perform as strong as I’d like, as it’s only acceptable. 7.5/10 

Cow
Delightfully fresh and has a delicious apple note on top. Not nearly as lactonic as I thought It’d be. It’s slightly lactonic and that is bolstered with the pop of sage on the top. It’s unlike anything you might find at a Sephora in that it combines a fruity cleanliness with a sagey, milky blend. Dry down is sweet and dry. I like this one a lot, and performance is adequate. 8/10

Chipmunk
This is a delightfully green, woody and grassy fragrance that is rooted in fougere, barbershop masculine notes. There are pachouli, pink pepper and cedar notes that work really well on my skin chemistry. It’s versatile and not challenging at all to me. Performance is adequate. 8/10 

Harvest mouse
This is a really nice fragrance. It balances warm nutty sweet gourmand with interesting notes of beer and wheat. Some might think it smells a little bit medicinal for its clovy nutmeg notes. Usually vanilla forward fragrances are not my cup of tea, but everything mixed with this makes it really enjoyable. In the end the dry down is sweet, gourmand and nutty. Maybe a bit like rabbit but slightly more spiced. This is a nice one. Performance is adequate. 7.5/10

Civet
This is challenging not for its animalic nature, but for its syrupy dry down. It does not do well with my skin chemistry in the slightest.  It’s weirdly sweet yet not honey or sugar sweet. The resins and coffee and vanilla all mixed together lay heavy on my skin and bring out a funk that is unappealing to my nose. Performance is strong. 4/10

Sacred scarab
Really nice. I like the warm sweet spicy fruitiness here. There is a palpable animalic note of civet to cut through everything. Deep and rich yet somewhat airy at the same time? Really well balanced between clean, spicy and dirty. I can see this one being well received by a masculine crowd. Performance is strong. 8/10 camel wins by just a smidge for me.",4,1730773721.0,fragrance,2,1.0,False

I recently got accepted into LSA as a transfer student for the winter semester from a community college where I have an associate’s degree (did early college in hs). I’m interested in going into biomedical engineering, and multiple people told me to apply to LSA and then transfer to the CoE. 

I haven’t taken any classes very specific to my major, so if I get into it and end up hating it my second “major of interest” would probably be pre-dental. I live in Michigan and plan on commuting to campus. 

I’m currently taking Calc III and Calc-Based Physics I. I’m doing pretty well in both of those classes rn, but I have exams coming up for physics and am worried about the class. The worst case scenario is that I fail, and I’m wondering if that happens what are the chances that I get my acceptance revoked. I’ve never got below a 3.5 in any college class. If I end up doing bad and had to retake the class I know I would do a lot better. My physics professor says our class is MIT level and it’s hard so we can be able to transfer it to any college.

I’m very into music, I play bass guitar and percussion but most enjoy playing in jazz ensembles. My other most significant hobby is arts and crafts, specifically sewing and crochet. I also roller skate and am consumed by fashion. Some hobbies I want to dive deeper into are reading, running, learning different instruments, language learning, and shuffle dance. 

So if there’s any cool clubs, extracurriculars, or places (specifically coffee shops) in Ann Arbor that might fit these interests please let me know. ",3,1730773677.0,uofm,0,1.0,False

So unfortunately, I was at fault when driving a rental vehicle from enterprise & I was involved in a crash on September 30th of this year. No other passengers involved. Furthermore; a deeper investigation that night led to me being detained for a months time and the vehicle was towed by a company named ""JP towing"" later that morning. 
The police had taken evidence from the vehicle & then the vehicle was taken to JP's lot. 
I was unaware of this while incarcerated; as all of my belongings in the truck needed to be obtained still. 

On October 28th I was released on bail and conditions to my own faults. 
I contacted the police and they told me the property from the vehicle was ready to be claimed from JP towing , so off I went to JP. (Across the map from the crash scene.) 

When I got to the tow yard/ the man clerk was very confused as to what vehicle I was referring to as the truck was not at their yard anymore & had actually been gone since the 3rd of October. 
Being as enterprise picked it up at 10:30pm October 3rd. It arrived at JP towing October 3rd at 2:30pm and left from there with enterprise knowledge. 
It then got taken wherever (with my belongings) and somehow ended up at IAA in Oshawa. 

So I called IAA , and explained the situation. 
Also called the police and told them that they gave me wrong information. They told me to go to IAA for my belongings ; as did enterprise. 
Enterprise was emailing IAA supposedly, to track my belongings. 

While speaking to IAA, I spoke to a woman that told me that the truck had come in & was purchased already- but hasn't left the lot. 
So I asked about my belongings and they never got back to me & denied my calls when telling me they would call me back. 
I waited all weekend. 


Now , I  hadn't heard back since Friday this last week , so this morning I called IAA. The same lady then told me that they recovered my belongings from the truck and it was picked up by the buyer. 
I asked when I could come and pick up my belongings - she said as soon as possible because they have a lot there. 

So I travelled by go train, all the way to the insurance /auction lot in Oshawa today. 


The experience I had was relentless & heartbreaking. 

Upon entering IAA, I asked to speak with the woman whom I spoke with earlier this morning, and she right away had a very unpleased look on her face about me coming to collect my property. 

She seen me and said "" our guys take pride in being throughout with cleaning & making sure everything is there."" 
""We just collect all garbage and throw it into bags and then the property is left in the vehicle."" 

So after she said this, she went to the back & grabbed a contractor garbage bag of stuff and handed it to me. 
Right away- I knew that not even half of my belongings were in the bag. But I took it and I said ""that's it?"" She proceeded to bat back at me and said ""that's all that was there , if there was anything else than it's been taking by the rental company."" 

I took a walk outside with the bag, opened it to see that not even a fraction of my belongings were there including very expensive shoes, brand clothing , electronics , jewellery , etc.

I returned back inside and I confronted her about it & her demeanour got worse. Almost offended. And she told me to wait and that she would be back. 
Insisted I sit down and wait as if 
I WAS IN TROUBLE..?
And she came back with a hi vis vest, handed it to me and told me to walk around the building as the truck was being brought for me to see.. (wasn't it already sold and picked up this morning?)
So I walked out to the back & went to the window to check who I was to speak to about the vehicle and lone behold, she's back there making a scene about something to the two yard men that I assume would be in charge of cleaning the truck & I witnessed her mid freak out. The one man opened the door and asked if I was there to see the truck and I agreed. I walked towards the truck and the two men followed me and asked me what I was missing and upon seeing the truck, 
There was still various things that belonged to me within the truck & no garbage had been thrown out or even cleaned. They actually took some of my stuff and threw it into the bed of the truck under the scrap auto parts from 
The accident and destroyed my belongings that were there , but all of my safety gear, all of my power tools, my hand tools, brand new car seat , amongst many more items - were not there or even recovered. 

I have video recordings of the whole thing as well as pictures
I told them I wanted to figure out who to speak to about this situation of my stuff being stolen & they offered me a coffee. In response I said no. I want my stuff. 
And they left. 


I returned to the front office and spoke about me getting my lawyer involved and she said to go after enterprise. 

And was very rude about it. 


Man , I'm starting to lose my mind a bit. 

I just need some help with who to call and what to do. 

If anyone could please help me out.

1gjw62z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1gjw62z/what_would_you_do_about_a_mean_sibling/,What would you do about a mean sibling?,"I've had my sister and her husband living with me in my house for the last two months. Our mum died unexpectedly and our dad told them to move out, but we'd been planning for them to come live with me eventually anyway. They are both very welcome here, I put together a periodic lease for them so it's official and they know I legally can't just throw them out - and I never would, but accusations are confessions, and she accused me many many times of not really wanting her around, to the point where I kinda don't anymore. If this were her house and I pissed her off, she'd probably kick me out or at least threaten it so she can have her way, I don't doubt that for a moment.

My sister is volatile. She always has been. The morning of their wedding she cracked the shits with hubby and went AWOL for an hour. We had relatives and friends visiting from all over and it was a shit show trying to cover for her when the groom wasn't even sure if the wedding was still going ahead and the guests are sitting around awkwardly waiting. It took us another hour or so to convince her to let us do her hair and makeup, she decided that she was going to go ahead with no hair and makeup and not even in her special wedding dress. Obviously she would have never forgiven us if we had let her go ahead with her stupid plan.

I'm not privy to the details of their relationship and I don't really want to know either, but I know my sister is a person you have to be really really careful around. She has a really aggressive attitude that she just doesn't seem to recognise or be aware of. She's developed a hobby of monologuing about all of the things that have gone wrong for her and how badly she was treated at school and work. We have had a few road trips together in the last couple of months and she will spend five hours straight talking about old wounds if you don't redirect her. 

She prefers to word things as passive aggressive sarcastic questions instead of helpful suggestions or reminders. Ie - instead of saying hey could you hang that decoration sideways so we don't have to duck, she would choose a harsh tone and say and what do you expect us to do when we walk under, just smack our heads? Do you think our guests would be comfortable and enjoying themselves with that in the way? She will continue till you verbally acknowledge that you are going to do it her way. She also chose to say this to me in front of all our relatives so I felt small and worthless. I once told her to pull over because she was driving like a dickhead, she was speeding and tailgating on the freeway, so she decided that she would hitchhike home and I had to grovel and beg for 40 minutes (and listen to her lecture me about MY dangerous driving that she had never mentioned before) before she'd get back in the car. I would probably have called her bluff and fucking left her there if we weren't in the middle of nowhere and leaving her would have been dangerous. 

So my sister is like, emotionally violent with everyone around her. I don't know how else to describe it. She doesn't fight fair, she'll always bring other stuff up, she'll go for the jugular. She once told me I deserved to be abused, because she was angry at me for not allowing her to harass a housemate I was having a conflict with. (Two seconds of thinking about it and you might realise starting shit with my housemate would just escalate all my problems at home) Just nasty shit like that. Like you think she's throwing a lifeline, but it's a snake and it'll bite when you grab hold. She knows I don't trust her and I try not to let on how I feel, but I can't hide that I resent her for all of the abuse she's dished out over the years. If she decided to cut me off forever I think my life would be much more peaceful and simple. I find myself wishing she would storm out and not come back. I'm just venting now, but if anyone has insight I'd love to hear your thoughts on this one -

We had some relatives visiting this weekend and she had two screaming matches with her husband in the morning while we were all hanging out. He's European so he will raise his voice when he's upset and she doesn't yell, just keeps repeating ""you don't love me"" and stuff, telling him his English is shit and he doesn't understand. We tried very hard not to listen and to continue our conversation in the next room. The relatives were pretty shocked. Sister comes into the sitting room where I am with the guests and tells me to evict him, they're getting a divorce. She then made several remarks about ending it all and locked herself in her bedroom while her husband simmered down outside. I was and still am concerned about these remarks, especially since we're all still grieving. 

But then she comes out of her room and it's like she's hit the reset button on everything. She's calm, cheerful, hanging out with the relatives, coming out for coffee with us, buying Christmas presents for her husband like she didn't tell me to evict him that morning. Her husband looks deflated and miserable, crying outside. He goes at her with the same attitude she brings to him, so naturally she escalates until the other person backs down. I don't believe it's typical for him to get aggressive the way she has done all our lives. He's shown me texts where she's threatening divorce and saying angry unkind things. Once she has her way, it's all water under the bridge to her, no matter what vile shit she's just said to her loved ones. If you get angry at her and carry it past the point that she's finished with the issue, you're the asshole in her eyes and she'll start up again. I have a good sibling relationship with my brother in law so I can tell he's beaten down and hurting, but I can't get involved or take a side and I don't want to. I can't imagine what she'd do to me if she thought I was siding with him against her.

What do you do when you're third wheeling a dysfunctional couple? People will probably just say ""just cut her off!"" And I daydream about that like other people would daydream about winning the lottery. If I'm going to go nuclear on her I might as well just kill myself because that will be faster, easier and probably have pretty much the same outcome.

I have embodied the Grey Rock. I don't have much going on at the moment anyway, so I don't need to share my opinions, my political views, I don't need to tell her if I'm dating, I bite my tongue 4 times out of 5 when it comes to anything personal or idealogical. I have my own inner bubble of safety and calm, and I can live just fine inside myself like that. She's gotten very frustrated with me for my grey rocking. I didn't tell her how I voted in a recent referendum because I knew she would have a go at me for it, so instead she had a go at me for not telling her how I voted. (I voted yes to the voice because I understand how the constitution works, would you believe it) I'm scared to water the pot plants because I did once a few days after she moved in and she came after me asking all kinds of sarcastic  questions in an angry tone. Yeah I'm not good at remembering to water the plants, I only kept a couple while I was getting the hang of it, but now I feel sick and sad when I look at my pot plants.

Well now I'm 32, she's almost 34, and I don't think this is a fair way for me to live my life anymore. I feel like I'm letting her walk all over me. I bought a place on my own and lived here just fine for a year but two months into this new arrangement and she ""does everything around this house"" and I'm back to feeling like a useless, helpless child in trouble, tiptoeing around the grown ups fighting bitterly.

Please ladies, give me your wisdom and your strength. This post has become such a mess. I need some tough love and constructive criticism, but if you just want to tell me this is my fault for letting her move in and I deserve this, spare it, you'd probably get along better with my sister.

1gjw24j,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1gjw24j/very_very_bad_relationship_im_m29_and_she_f29/,"very very bad relationship. I'm M29, and she F29. ","Our relationship was very complicated from the start. I'm M\[29\]s, and she F\[29\]s. At first we were friends, but from the very beginning I made it clear that I was interested in having a relationship with her. She said she wasn't ready because she had just come out of a complicated relationship. I decided to wait for her, because I felt something very strong (although I hadn't made it clear how strong the feeling was).

After almost a year, she approached me for a friendship with benefits. After a couple of months, we started to get involved sentimentally and finally started dating. However, during quiet conversations at the beginning of our relationship, I discovered that she had had intimate and even sentimental relationships with other people, including work colleagues, something she never told me when we were just friends. This deeply shook my trust in her, to the point where we had to have difficult conversations to try to understand the situation, but these conversations were never sincere on her part. She said that she had a deep friendship with me and that she didn't want to lose me, among other things that I knew weren't true.

From then on, I began to feel very insecure. There came a time when I said that we needed to break up or she would have to regain my trust. I said that maybe we should break up because, even though she hadn't done anything wrong, I couldn't control my feelings and the weight of that was too great. She decided to stay with me, even with my reservations. shee said that we didn't need to date and that we could just have a submissive relationship, a BDSM relationship, but I thought that wasn't healthy, cause we had a lot of feelings. However, our relationship ended up being very influenced by this.

Over time, I became completely lost in jealousy, and I knew she was lying to reassure me. When I asked her if she had seen the person she got involved with at work, she always said no, but that didn't make sense, since they worked in the same environment. I tried to end the relationship a few times, but she was too upset and I couldn't break it off. I asked her to avoid responding to certain people with whom she was still in contact. One day, I saw that she hadn't followed the agreement. She was at my house, working on my laptop in the living room, and I told her I was very upset and wanted her to leave. I went to the bedroom and ended up sleeping for over an hour; when I woke up, she was still there. I insisted that she should leave, but another hour passed and she was still there. I told her she was overstepping her bounds, grabbed my laptop to put it away and just then I heard a bang. She had thrown my desk onto the floor, breaking the fan. There was coffee and a broken cup on the floor.

I told her she had to leave and threw her out of the house.she held onto the door, and even though I didn't push, as I'm much bigger than her, when she let go of the door, she staggered and hit her head on the neighbor's door. I felt really bad about it... to the point of completely forgetting why I was upset, and I apologized profusely. She said that what I had done was absurd and that I should be arrested. I felt deeply sorry and she forgave me. I didn't bring it up again, but it became a horrible cycle.

She kept testing me and pushing the boundaries, breaking our agreements. I'd try to hold back, but she'd start, for example, crying and screaming in the bathroom, and I'd worry about the neighbors hearing. I would try to get her out of the bathroom, but similar scenes would repeat themselves. It was a cycle that seemed endless, and I felt like the worst person in the world. I always tried to end the relationship, but she blamed me intensely. She would say that she would make my life hell and, sometimes, that she would end her own life. She would hit me and tell me to hit back, to hit her, but I never did! All the incidents were accidents, although I carry a lot of guilt for not having contained myself better. I know I shouldn't have gotten involved in such a horrible cycle, but she was testing my limits and her hatred for me was growing.

I also started making the same mistakes, I also started threatening to hurt myself, I was feeling so much guilt, so much hurt. I didn't know what to do, I was deeply disgusted with myself.

She started to hit me hard when she was drinking, and sometimes she'd get on top of me. she'd stab me in the arm with a pen, hit me over the head with her fists several times. and I didn't do anything. I just stood there. she kept hitting me. and I kept kicking her out of the house... or holding her down wen she was very out of control and I was afraid she might hurt herself.... I regret it so much.... I should have realized my limits... I should never have started a relationship with her.

Everything became a cause for chaos, and my jealousy and insecurity were still present. Whenever I tried to talk about it, the result was more chaos. She kept lying to me, and I kept losing myself, until I finally broke up with her on our one-year anniversary. It was a horrible experience.

she said she would do anything to make my life a living hell... she said she wanted me to die, that I was a monster.

I don't know how to deal with it all now, or what she might say and do about me. I know I made a lot of mistakes and I have a lot of guilt. We were both going through each other's cell phones, and I started trying to control her every move. I always knew where she was, because I didn't trust her, because I knew she didn't really like me.

She also went through my cell phone... she also went through my things... my computer.

I was toxic, sending her millions of messages and calling her cell phone non-stop, always suspicious and weak. I feel ashamed of myself... very ashamed. The more I showed this weak side, the more she stepped on me and belittled me. I feel really bad about all this, I really do.

I broke up over two months ago. I tried to maintain a good relationship with her, I waited until she got involved with other people before I moved on. I told myself that I would suppress any feeling of control so that she could be happy and I would try to leave a good impression between us. I was very insecure and weak. ADHD didn't help either...

I was diagnosed with RTLE a couple of months ago (Idiopathic). Since my diagnosis, I have been in deep ketosis (blood levels 1.5-4) since. The reason I didn’t take my Keppra prescription is because I don’t want to take it in pregnancy, and I plan on getting pregnant next month. I know it’s said to be safe, but I don’t like the research I’ve found. 

I wanted to know if anyone else used keto instead of medication, instead of the other way around. 

Please note - I have only focal seizures every 2 months max. I believe they are lifestyle related, and have made a lot of changes including quitting: coffee, alcohol, vaping, and obviously sugar. No I haven’t had any symptoms since I made these changes. 

* I don’t plan on being full keto in pregnancy. My last pregnancy I had no focals during or after pregnancy until I started vaping and drinking again.

The goal was to make a bunch of quality of life perks. >!But I struggle with keeping myself from adding overpowered stuff!<

The effects of some of you’re chosen perks can be shared with others, to a lesser degree. This is done by giving them food/drink that you summon. When they consume it they gain a weaker version of the effect, with the same time limit. 

Pick 2 from each section, and 2 more from any section, giving you 8 perks in total. If you have made a 6perks before >!you can pick 3 more perks from any section. Bringing your total to 11!<

________________________________________
Perks to get around. 

**Walking**:   You can now safely walk/stand on anything: walk on water, walk underwater, walk up walls, walk in the air. If you had any injury, illness, or deformity that prevented you from walking, you are cured of it. 

**Running**:  You can run as fast as you want. You have enhanced dexterity/perception that **scales up and down** with your current running speed. You will never get tired or sweaty from running, but you do burn calories. (This perk protects you from friction and time dilation. This doesn’t allow any speedforce stuff)

**Crawling**:  While crawling on at least 3 limbs, you can slow down time, even stopping it if you want. This ends if you stop crawling, for example standing up or laying down. 

**Digging**:   You can easily dig through any physical material, and with great effort can even dig into nearby realities. You don’t know what reality you are digging into. You come across deposits of valuable natural minerals & ore quite often while digging. You are immune to harm while digging. 

**Jumping**:   You can jump (Teleport) anywhere within your current reality. This doesn’t provide any environmental protection if you jump somewhere dangerous like a volcano or the moon. 

**Skipping**:   You can Time travel by skipping. The strength, height, and distance of your skip determines how far you travel. It will take a good bit of practice before you can travel with accuracy. (This is the “you are the only you” kind of time travel). 

**Vehicle**: choose 1 real world vehicle, you can now summon that vehicle to your side at will. The vehicle has infinite fuel and is indestructible. You have the skill and necessary licenses to operate your vehicle. (Your chosen vehicle can be changed once a month. This also replaces any skill and licenses gained for the previous vehicle). 



________________________________________
Breakfast perks to start you off. 
You can summon a plate/bowl of your chosen breakfast food at will, any brand/variety that you’ve had before.
Consuming your chosen breakfast food gives you the listed effect.

**Toast and hash browns**: Bread and butter, you now get money by eating toast and hash browns. 1 piece of toast with butter or other topping gives you 100 dollars in your local currency. 1 plate of hash browns gives 1,000 dollars in your local currency. All money is legal and tax free. 

**Cold pizza**: You might be thinking that cold pizza doesn’t belong on a list of breakfast food, well I say it does. For 24 hours after eating cold pizza, annoying unlucky things won't happen to you. For example: you won't be randomly caught up behind traffic, you won't randomly have someone's food platter falling onto you at a restaurant, and you won't stub your toe. 

**Pastries** 🥐: For the next 24 hours after eating pastries you can cleanse impurities, it can be used to clean things of dirt and filth. It can be used on wounds to prevent infection or on objects to deep clean them. This can also restore rusty and worn out items. >!Who else makes a mess with flour when trying to make pastries?!<

**Yogurt**: For 24 hours after eating Yogurt you can preform a Data acquisition. With this, you conduct a full scan of the target’s composition, history, mental state, emotions, current and past medical conditions, current thoughts, current stats and measurements, a list of their skills, and how items were made. This can also be used to learn the contents of a book or computer by scanning it. The last part, for those 24 hours you can, at will, do interesting things like taste sound & see smells.

**French toast**: for the next 24 hours you can make anyone surrender or give up on whatever you want. >!The French are great at surrendering!<

**Biscuits and gravy**: You can now summon zombie servants, well not actually zombies but they are extremely dumb. You can summon 1 per Biscuit with gravy that you eat. They exist for about 3 hours after you summon them. They are only capable of simple chores like cleaning the dishes or sweeping the floor, but cooking is beyond them. If you told them to cook, they would try, and most likely burn the food and themselves. 

**Breakfast burrito**: They have the right idea with the siesta or afternoon nap. For 24 hours after eating a breakfast burrito, whenever you sleep, your work gets done as if you were working on it diligently. 

**Vitamin gummies**: consuming a vitamin gummy will give you a completely random superpower for the next 24 hours. This power has a 99.9% chance to be non-harmful to you. You can only have 1 superpower from this at a time, eating more vitamin gummies within the 24 hours period won’t have any effect. 

**Calentado**: Colombian traditional morning meal, which means “heated.” Made of leftovers from the previous night’s dinner. Unlike the other choices, this allows you to summon any kind of food that you’ve eaten before, but you don’t get any other supernatural power.

They shared with me that the good feeling I had was that it was the Holy Ghost and that I could have it all the time as I repented and became baptized.

A few days ago they shared with me the baptismal questions of which there was a question about the law of chastity and one about the word of wisdom. I was essentially told that breaking the law of chastity was next to murder. I found this hard to believe but in the literature they provided me, this was confirmed. Then they were telling me that it was forbidden to drink coffee and tea but it was alright to have energy drinks. This I found to be very confusing.

Once, during a bad episode, I went to the clinic and my heart rate was at 200. The doctor checked me out and ran some tests, and they said my heart is healthy and my results were all normal. They told me it’s probably just stress and advised me to avoid coffee and tea and prescribed me some meds.

Lately, though, it’s been happening more often. After my dad passed away and with the severe depression and stress I’m dealing with, the episodes have been way more frequent, especially this past week. They feel so bad that it’s like I’m dying, literally, I feel like I’m going to throw up my heart and and I can’t do anything to make it better, I try to breathe, do something or distract myself but it doesn’t help. I was recently prescribed antidepressants by my psychiatrist, but I’m not sure I’f I should take them because they might help with what I’m going through?? It’s also really affecting my sleep and now I’m on meds to help slow my heart rate and take magnesium for sleep, but like last night I couldn’t sleep even when I took the meds I slept until 7 am because of the pain because they don’t really help. I do take sometimes sleeping pills to help me sleep but now I’m trying to avoid them. It’s exhausting, I’m really, really tired. All of this is too much for me I swear, now at least I wanna just stop wtf is happening to me and I’m not sure what else to try. Idk it could be just anxiety and stress ? But man that’s too much.

We have been through good and bad times, like any friendship. Jenna and I went to the same middle, high school and college. She was friends with me through a past abusive relationship and was there for me constantly when a partner of mine had died. We lived in the same town after college for about a year before I needed to move away to further my education. We had always talked about living together in our city after I was done my second degree. 

I have been with my fiancé Tony (36m) for almost 5 years. We met on a dating app and initially were very casual. After about a year of being casual we decided to further our relationship. This was around the time I finished my degree and found my first full time job. This job happened to be close to where he lived. Our relationship was progressing and Jenna was still living in our home town with her parents. I moved in with Tony after about a year/ year and a half of dating. Jenna never said this upset her but would throw off hand comments like “well if you hadn’t moved in with Tony…”and “well if we had lived together like we planned…”

Jenna and I would still spend time together and Tony of course would be around sometimes. We would go to friends weddings together, out to bars/restaurants together and spend time with my family all together. I never noticed anything but the two of them bantering and joking around. 

I love Jenna…but she has always made me feel like I needed to prove how good Tony was to me. I felt like she was constantly critiquing him. 

For the past year and more recently, the past 6 months my friendship with Jenna has seemed “off”. We live about an hour away from each other now and being adults with full time jobs makes it hard to get together. I have been reaching out to her to plan a time to get together, I have invited her to celebrate my birthday celebration, my sporting events, etc. She was always too busy with other plans, or working. She has not been willing to meet me half way either. So, after some time and months of her avoiding me we planned to meet up. On her terms, in the town she lives in, after trying to compromise and meet sooner in a different place. 

We ended up meeting for coffee. The first half of our meeting was catching up and uneventful. It would be a little awkward at times in between conversations but nothing remarkable after finishing the coffee we decided to walk so that people in the coffee shop did not hear our , intimate conversation. She started the conversation by telling me how she was confused that it seemed like I had no idea why she was upset. I told her that I knew something was wrong, but I truly could not pinpoint something that had happened to upset her. She then tells me that my fiancé,Tony, upset her with the way he speaks to her. She also does not like the way he speaks to me. She continue to tell me that she felt he was rude, not funny and constantly picked on her. She said she had not been intentionally, avoiding me but ended up avoiding me because she did not want to interact or be around my fiancé. She claims she was not sure how to tell me this as it puts me in a difficult position.

I am still rather confused. My fiancé‘s personality is not for everyone. He is from a blue collar city and grew up a little rougher around the edges. He tells it straight and often times he does not have a filter, He is sarcastic and often likes to bust peoples stones as he would say.. He is the farthest thing from a bad person and after this interaction with my friend, she made me feel like he was a terrible person. 

After about 20 minutes of Jenna telling me how terrible he makes her feel when she’s around, how she has cried after leaving spending time with us and how she does not want to be around him. We left our discussion with the understanding that Jenna would not be planning on spending any time around Tony anytime soon and that I would talk to Tony about these things she brought to my attention. We would try to continue to make plans and hang out 1:1 while she takes space from him. She did not ask me to choose sides, she just does not want to be around him. 

I left our meeting in tears. How was I supposed to still have a close relationship to my best friend if she hates my fiancé? 

I understand that his personality is not for everyone, I understand that her feelings were hurt. What I don’t understand is why it took her so long to bring this up and why she never stood up for herself if she felt like he was disrespecting her.

Tony and I have plenty of other friendships that we spend more time with than with Jenna. None of which have discussed that they have felt concerned about my relationship with him. None of these friends/ friendships have brought up Tony being rude/ disrespectful or not funny.

I’m in a tough spot, but thankfully, my fiancé is understanding and is planning to reach out to her and apologize to try and mend things. He knows how important she is to me and I am not looking to end my friendship with her. All I want is for them to be civil and get along. Which he has told me this will be no problem because he has no issues getting along with her. But how do I manage my friendship with her now? Am I the asshole for not realizing that his behavior has been upsetting her to the point of tears? ",21,1730771450.0,TwoHotTakes,32,0.86,False

I’ll give you a quick background on my girlfriend and our relationship. She’s an extreme dismissive avoidant, she’s very emotionally immature, and she’s been through a lot of trauma. Extremely physically abusive and neglectful parents, her brother was murdered a few years ago. Her parents take her entire paycheck, they are immigrants and don’t make good money. So yeah, she’s been through a lot.

We met shortly after her brother was murdered, and I think that strengthened our bond so much, as she needed someone, and to me it was my first relationship. I was 20, she was 25. It started off electric and me I was sort of stuck in this hero mentality. I loved her so much I just wanted to see her happy so I did EVERYTHING. My entire paycheck for 3 years I would give to her, every dollar. I did 100% of her schoolwork, I would come into work on my days off, and do her assignments while she was on the clock, so she could relax, I got her little sister into college, I paid her family’s rent when her dad lost his job and got him a new one. This is on top of all regular relationship dynamics, affection, emotional support, dates, flowers, etc. I feel very deeply into this masculine/feminine role. She was naturally very feminine and I am naturally very masculine so it fit, but attachment styles ended up winning. Her self sabotaging issues, her avoidance, her CPTSD, my anger issues all boiled over into this intensely loving but hellish relationship. 

Still we loved each other. I was 2 months away from proposing to her, I was looking at rings and making plans to buy an apartment. By this time I was 23, just graduated. I forgot to mention earlier, although I was very close with her family, we kept our relationship secret because of our religion. One day we got into an intense argument, which was normal for us. But this time, when I woke up and tried to apologize I saw I was blocked on everything. I gave it a few days , thinking she just needed space, but she never unblocked me. In 3 years we had never gone over half a day without speaking, no matter how bad our arguments got.

On the third day, I texted her little sister, telling her to tell my girlfriend to unblock me. She did, and what she said to me completley destroyed me. She told me that she married someone else, that she never loved me, that I was never anything more than just a friend to her, and that she was happy to be finally be married. Needless to say her words crushed me. And this is probably a good time to explain that her parents and extremely traditional, poorly educated people. They actually tried to force her into two marriages before this one while we were dating, both of those failed. My girlfriend due to her immaturity, every time we would argue she would tell me she’s going to accept her next arranged marriage, so of course I stopped believing it after a while. And this time I didn’t either. Her words completley crushed me, but I didn’t believe it was real. Probably my own defenses taking over. 

I asked her to meet the next day to get my credit cards back. Obviously I didn’t care, I just wanted to see her. She agreed, and when we met she wasn’t lashing out anymore, but she wasn’t letting me touch her and she kept insisting we were never anything more than friends. I broke down in tears, she softened a bit, she gave me one last kiss and told me to pray for her that she would have an easy life. 

Even then, I couldn’t bring myself to believe she was married, my denial was at an extreme.  This was early June, for the next 30 days we spoke sporadically, her reaching out when she needed something , one time she was crying, and me being angry because I didn’t believe she was married and thought she was just trying to hurt me. I still dreamed of her every night. On July 4 I travel back to my home country for the summer, and as soon as I land one of our old coworkers sends me a text that says “Call me when you land ASAP”. I knew it was about my girl, I told her to just send me screenshots. She sent me screenshots of my girlfriend in a wedding dress, and another man holding her in his arms.

We’ve all experienced heartbreak before, but I truly don’t believe there’s a lot of people out there who can relate to this pain. My girl of 3 years, my first love, the woman who I saw my future with, the woman who I worked 15 hour shifts for 7 days a week while balancing both our college classes to make happy. I would cut off my arms to make this woman happy, and right in front of me is her in a wedding dress, and another man holding her in his arms. 

I immediately reached out to her, and we reestablished regular contact. I was able to find out that her parents went through her phone, found out we were dating, and rejected me. Because I’m from a different country and I’m significantly younger. They pressured her into marrying this guy. She went through bouts of depression during her engagement (we were still dating), she cut her hair short, fought against the marriage, but to no avail. This marriage went through, that day we had our argument and she blocked me on everything was 2 days before her marriage. 

But in early July we did reestablish contact again, I was just doing what I can to make things easier for her, and holding onto her as desperately as I could. As stupid as it sounds, I believed this whole thing would just boil over, and she just needed time to see we still loved each other and should fight for each other, and everything would be okay. So I did what I could to support her, paying for coffee, helping her with work, checking on her, etc. She was obviously in emotional turmoil, oscillating between leaning on me one second, then lashing out the next. This continued until one day she said she needed help paying off her tickets. 



She said her husband gets mad when it comes to money, and this guy, he’s genuinely a terrible person. From what I know about him, he’s broke, immature, type of guy who pays for Instagram followers, broke up with his girlfriend to marry mine, and eventually (we’ll get to this) cheated on my girlfriend. So yeah, a real piece of work. 

Anyway, I saw it as an opportunity to bring her closer to me and further from her husband, so I happily paid $250 for her tickets. That night as we were talking, she said she was going to have to block me again, stating that she couldn’t be disrespectful to her marriage. I know it’s stupid, but I still saw us as dating at the time. I couldn’t keep my cool anymore, we got into a huge fight. The pain of everything piled up. She ended up fainting, and her parents found out we were still talking, obviously it didn’t go so well for her. After this day, we forgave each other, she was kind to me for a few more days but I think this argument solidified her “choice” in moving forward with the marriage. She asked for help with more tickets and few later, which I did, and a work assignment, and after that a complete 180. 

She started getting visibly annoyed with me every time I reached out. One day we were having another intense conversation, and I said I was going to buy her an apartment soon so she could have a safe place to live. She basically said why would you, he’s by husband not a stranger, I love him and I’m going to have a kid with him. 

I know everyone is going to grill me for this, but I brushed these comments off. I thought she was going through intense emotional turmoil, which honestly she might have been, and my unwavering support and ability to withstand everything would change everything. So from July 21 to August 11, this continued, I would check on her, send her gift cards for her coffee, and she would get annoyed and tell me to chill, although she would continue using the gift cards. 

On August 11, while I was out, I saw her holding hands with her husband. This is kind of when it hit me, that she was genuinely moving on with her new life, and that our love was genuinely worthless. I texted her when I got home, her response was defensive “excuse me that’s my husband, what’s the point of you even bringing this up.”

I remember that day looking in the mirror and having an intense conversation with myself. This was my girlfriend, in a marriage she didn’t want, conforming, doing what she has to to keep the peace. Am I going to let her suffer her future with this man because of the pain I’m I , or am I going to brush my pain to the side and find a way to get her out of this. I chose to keep fighting, but I was going to have to undergo immense work.

I came up with a plan, first I was going to go no contact for a month. In this month I was going to work on my emotional control, she needed emotional safety from me, not judgement for trying to make the best out of her situation. I was going to buy her an apartment, and I was going to subtly sabotage her marriage. All these combined would fix everything, so I got to work.

I did run into her holding hands with her husband one more time, it was like a movie scene. She stepped into the elevator turned around and saw me, we held eye contact until the elevator door closed.

I reached out to her a few days after, breaking no contact, just telling her that I’m not upset with her and that she holds a special place in my heart, and that no matter what I’m always here for her. She gave a polite but distant response, success I thought. With her extreme avoidant style if she’s responding that means she hasn’t given up on me. A week later I messaged her asking if she needed anything, no response, but she did use the gift card I sent her. I didn’t know at the time but she was getting ready to move into her husbands home. This was mid September. 

On October 7, I got an email that her student loans were due soon. Since I used to take care of everything for her, my email was under her account. I used it as an excuse to reach out to her. This time there was a noticeable shift, she was extremely grateful for me reaching out, thanking me, and asking for advice on how to handle her loans. She even brought up seeing each other to work on it, but said she would ask her husband. At first I denied and said I would take care of it from my laptop, I didn’t want another man’s permission to meet “my woman”. 

A week later I reached out to her, I had taken care of a few things on my end and was updating her. She was a bit more closed off this time, citing that she was having a lot of problems at work and revealed that she might be pregnant. Listen, I don’t care what heartbreak you’ve been through. Your girlfriend of 3 years was not pregnant with another man’s child 4 months after you broke up. I can’t even begin to describe to you how that broke me, I felt the most unimaginable pain for about 2 days, and then nothing. I just went numb. And I’ve been numb ever since. 

But upon finding out she might be pregnant, my plan to sabotage her marriage went underway. Given that her husband cheated on his girlfriend to marry mine, I knew he was a man of no morals. I sent one of those loyalty testers to DM him. At first I told her to wait, I wanted to wait until I secured an apartment for her. But of course, hearing she might be pregnant didn’t give me another option. If I was going to save her from this marriage, I had to do it now.


So around October 15 she starts messaging him, and he’s being responsive. At the same time, my girlfriend is getting closer to me , she called me for the first time since her marriage saying that we are going to meet up but she’s just been under a lot of stress and busy. I reassured her, I wasn’t blocked on iMessage anymore, she was thanking me for the gift cards I was sending. Everything was perfect, I was going to get my girlfriend back. She wouldn’t be this open with me again if her husband was meeting her needs. She was growing more disillusioned with marriage and closer to me, and her husband was flirting with another woman. Everything is going perfect. 

By October 30, her husband has agreed to go out with my loyalty tester, and back to her place after. He’s flirted with her, FaceTimed her, and I have screenshots of everything. If I haven’t crossed moral boundaries already, here is where I crossed them immensely. I made sure that he agreed to go on a date on November 2, her late brothers birthday. I hoped it would hit her parents so hard, they would realize what a mistake they made forcing her to marry this piece of garbage and demand a divorce. I dirtied my hands, but I swear, I was so numb by this point it wasn’t about us getting together, it was about saving her from a future with this garbage of a man. 

The night before her brothers birthday, I made a groupchat of her and her family members from a fake number pretending to be the loyalty tested, and was as intense as possible in revealing his infidelity. I warned her of STD’s, mentioned his disrespect in planning the infidelity on her late brothers birthday, etc.

It obviously hit her and her family very hard. And as guilty as I felt, I felt I finally won. No way could this marriage continue with his blatant disrespect to her and her entire family. I was wrong.

She texted me a few days later saying her life had been horrible. I tried to be there for her, of course knowing why but playing stupid. Then she said I know it was you. I continued playing dumb, but she knows me too well I guess. She went into a rant, asking me why I would hurt her on a sacred day. How much I hurt her family, that she was happy and I was ruining it. She revealed she had spent that night in the hospital, and that she was in fact pregnant. I didn’t try to defend myself, we had a semi intense conversation. I was in control and honest, I told her I loved her, I didn’t want to lose her to this life. That clearly her husband was a terrible person, he doesn’t respect her or her family she holds so dear. I think not defending myself and clearly stating my intentions reached her, or maybe it was just her avoidance, but she seemed to understand as many lines as I crossed it’s because I wanted what was best for her. She just did a 180 mid conversation and went from attacking to me saying she forgives me and joking around. She seemed to me partly in denial, she said her husband knew it was a test from the start. I asked her if she truly believed that, but she deflected saying either way they’ve moved on from it.

So here I am. And I finally understand. My girlfriend after a life of trauma and abuse is seeking not love, not to thrive, but just stability. Her husband got her away from her abusive parents, she’s pregnant, in a culture that looks down on divorce, with no money for her own. Her parents are satisfied and excited for their grandchild. She doesn’t want me to save her, I thought the infidelity would break apart her marriage. But I didn’t take into account this isn’t a marriage of love, it’s one of survival and stability for her. So long as he’s not demanding or abusive, then she doesn’t see a reason to leave. Our love wasn’t enough, I wasn’t enough. 

I sent her one last message, telling her I love her, and that I want what’s best for her, and that her child deserves a good man as a father, and that I can’t stay in the background supporting her because it’s only making it easier for her to stay in this life. And that this was my goodbye forever. She said thank you and that she was happy, I didn’t respond and then she said take care and goodbye.

So here I am. If I was financially secure before I could’ve bought her a safe place to live, she wouldn’t have had to go through this marriage. If I hadn’t waited to do the loyalty test, I could’ve ended this marriage before she had her pregnancy tying her down. And now after spending October promising her I would always be there for her, I’m now leaving her to her fate. August - September I was cutting myself like crazy, I couldn’t take the pain of not being able to protect my girlfriend. And October I stopped because I saw light for the first time, now I realize how much I failed. I only made things worse. Why. Why did I fail at every single aspect of protecting her.

This was at the coffee bean at the Americana in Glendale in 2022 (or maybe early 23). I was working the register on a really busy day and I fucking HATED that job. There was a massive line, and I glanced at it to see Ab and Leena at the back!! Instantly started sweating I was so nervous knowing I’d interact with them and was just trying not to be weird lol, I have pretty bad anxiety and couldn’t think of what to do. When he finally came up to me, I took his order anxiously, trying to be cool. Once he finished saying his order, I said “ok great, for AB, right?” He looked at me SO confused and said “…did I say my name before..?” And then I started spewing how I was a huge fan of the show and of him, he was so sweet about it even though I’d made it SO weird lol. 

Because people kept stealing our tip jars, my boss had gotten these new ones that were basically padlocked to the register and had the smallest slit to insert money into. He spend so long trying to cram a whole bunch of money into the tip jar for me, it’s generally a bitch to put money in but he was doing several bills at once which made it even harder, and the line was huge and he just kept trying to stuff it in and I think in that moment we where both equally anxious lol so I helped him shove it in there and he thanked me for being a fan!! Leena had left before he was at the register but she came in to get the drinks with him, and in there way out he went out of his way to call out to me and say bye!!! 

Afterwards, I told my coworker to watch the register and I ran to the bathroom to freak out and text my friend who’s a fan too!!

LOVE YOU AB! UR AMAZING! FLOKA!

So here I am. And I finally understand. My girlfriend after a life of trauma and abuse is seeking not love, not to thrive, but just stability. Her husband got her away from her abusive parents, she’s pregnant, in a culture that looks down on divorce, with no money for her own. Her parents are satisfied and excited for their grandchild. She doesn’t want me to save her, I thought the infidelity would break apart her marriage. But I didn’t take into account this isn’t a marriage of love, it’s one of survival and stability for her. So long as he’s not demanding or abusive, then she doesn’t see a reason to leave. Our love wasn’t enough, I wasn’t enough. 

I sent her one last message, telling her I love her, and that I want what’s best for her, and that her child deserves a good man as a father, and that I can’t stay in the background supporting her because it’s only making it easier for her to stay in this life. And that this was my goodbye forever. She said thank you and that she was happy, I didn’t respond and then she said take care and goodbye.

So here I am. If I was financially secure before I could’ve bought her a safe place to live, she wouldn’t have had to go through this marriage. If I hadn’t waited to do the loyalty test, I could’ve ended this marriage before she had her pregnancy tying her down. And now after spending October promising her I would always be there for her, I’m now leaving her to her fate. August - September I was cutting myself like crazy, I couldn’t take the pain of not being able to protect my girlfriend. And October I stopped because I saw light for the first time, now I realize how much I failed. I only made things worse. Why. Why did I fail at every single aspect of protecting her.

1gjvhym,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1gjvhym/an_american_sunday/,An American Sunday,"It was one of those beautiful American afternoons. The sky was as blue as she could be, with just a few stripes of white clouds hanging patriotically in the air. All that was missing was a bit of red, and even the heavens could looks as fabulous as old glory. Foster looked up and smiled. He could just tell that today was going to be a great day. He was even looking forward to his chores. There was something satisfying about mowing the lawn on his American made tractor, sipping an American beer and doing his best to forget about the boss, like all good American workers. This morning’s coffee had been especially smooth, a good omen, though sadly it had probably been grown in some foreign country. His wife Karen was in the back, tending to her lavish garden like she did every beautiful Sunday. It was an excellent way to channel her maternal instinct, Foster thought.

There was a strange stillness in the air. It took a few moments for Foster to realize this, as his weekend ritual had made him particularly numb to the rest of the world. But eventually, there was no denying that something was off. The birds had stopped arguing with one another, and a car hadn’t driven past Foster’s house in quite a while. It was never this quiet; not even on the Lord’s day in God’s country.

Then, there came a sound. At first it was too quiet to make out; a mere hum. Over time, it became clear that the noise was a kind of rhythmic chant coming from all around. As it became louder, it seemed to shake anything small or loose at first, but soon it became a distant roar as a large mass of people seemed to surround them from every side. They were chanting the familiar cry of “USA!” with a wild ghusto that bordered on manic. Foster was more than a little familiar with the chant, but something about it felt off. He caught himself almost instinctively joining in as he had done at countless baseball games, Barbaques, and more than a few town hall meetings, but paused, for there seemed no reason for such exuberance.

Foster’s neighbors began to pour out of their houses, aroused by the curiosity of the strange parade. Karen, having come in from the back, opened the front door, and took off her gardening gloves as she gazed at the spectacle. “What’s all the commotion, honey?” she asked.

“I’m not sure. It must be some kind of celebration. But I don’t remember there being a game on today, though.”

As the mob began to draw near, Foster could see that many of them were carrying crude weapons in their hands: clubs, axes and a few shovels. When the mob saw the people who had come out to see the commotion, they began to swing their weapons wildly in the air as they continued endlessly to chant: 

“**USA! USA! USA!**”

A few of the neighbors also joined in, grabbing the nearest blunt objects and lifting them triumphantly towards the sky. Others seemed suddenly terrified by the firery look in their loved ones’ eyes. Some ran. Those who stayed -- frozen in fear -- began to plead for their lives. If there had been any hesitation in the swiftness of their lethal blows, no one could tell. The pounded endlessly until the lifeless bodies of those they had loved only moments before had finished convulsing. 

“Foster I’m scared” Karen said as she clung to her husband. “What should we do?”

“Get in the house, we’re going into the panic room.”

Many in the crowd were storming the houses, surrounding the area like a swarm of locusts. The sound of their incessant chanting was making the walls tremble. Foster lead Karen down the stairs towards the cellar. There, in the coldroom, was an old commercial fridge that Foster had converted into a panic room. “Don’t worry,” Foster said in an effort to calm his wife, “It would take a blowtorch to get in here.”Karen stumbled into one of the corners of the room, and began sobbing uncontrollably. She was soon drowned out by the ceaseless chanting outside that seemed to be growing ever loader.

“**USA! USA! USA!**”

Foster wished that Karen would speak, if only to drown out the noise of the mob as they tore through the house, frantically looking for them. He remembered the look of glee on their faces as the rained down their blows, killing in an instant their loved ones while all chanting in unison. It felt like a nightmare for a moment, but that would soon pass. The fear that had gripped him had left quietly, and was soon replaced by a different emotion. Foster could hear a hidden rhythm in the chant, the way one only hear certain instruments of a song after listening to it countless times. And with this hidden rhythm also came a sensation. It was difficult to pinpoint at first, but soon it began to be clear. Very clear. He could feel something bubbling up. The desire to say something. Finally, he could fight it no more. He turned to look at Karen with a fiery look in his eyes, and slowly grabbed the flashlight off the small shelf and exclaimed with excited glee:

i had one just today actually: everyone wants to talk about their greatest love, but never directly. is it shame? 

so many of us want to express these feelings through song, poetry, and writing. how it changed us irrevocably or hurt us in such a way that we’ve evolved into someone totally different. 
but when i think about my greatest love i want to show the world how it has changed me. and when i say change, i dont mean turning into someone or something else. i mean it changed me in such a way that i actually became myself. 

the whole time i’ve known him, ten years and ten months to be exact, i’ve yearned to be more like him. i didnt realize until just recently that i didnt actually want to be more like him, but more like myself, just as he has always been himself

i want to shout this from the mountaintops. i loved him for being himself so much that i started to love me as i became more comfortable in my own right

still, today, despite us not talking anymore, i want to let him know how much his kindheartedness changed me to be more like me and less like the person i thought everyone else wanted me to be

when i get asked in therapy what about him makes me feel like i need him (which i realized i no longer do) i say i dont know anymore. i thought it was because he made me feel so comfortable and because he showed me what feeling that way could do, but now i know that he really only provided the blueprints but i built the rest on my own. i dont need him anymore. i really dont. 

but i want him

i want to hang out on the grass in front of the nelson atkins again, i wanna hate on cowboy killers as we suck them down together, i want to feel free from the influence of intoxicants and be high as kite at the same time, i want to talk and riff and say nothing, i want to look at pretty rocks and shells in high and low places, i want to admire art with him and share stolen glances, i want to break the fourth wall, i want to go on walks with him again so long that we forget where and when we started

it was the laundry room at our college dorm in september a decade ago and it’s still going on while i sit at this coffee shop waiting for you to text me back years from now

im learning to let you go, i promise

ive allowed myself to, or at least im starting to, i know at least that much

beyond romance? i dont think its possible

1gjvh6r,https://i.redd.it/t1sy8qkrmzyd1.jpeg,Experimenting with drinking alcohol take 2,"I’ve never felt so juvenile as I do when it comes to alcohol. I have had some people give me advice, but it’s just so overwhelming. There are so many options out there and I have a hard time wrapping my head around which makes sense for me.

So just a little back ground. My wife and kids are TBM. I’m PIMO with my foot out the door. I just recently asked to be released from my calling, told the EQ president I wasn’t doing ministering teaching, and stopped wearing garments. 

I do my WoW experiments when I’m traveling, so they are far and few between. I have tried coffee and didn’t love it. I do really enjoy the different versions of tea that I have tried.

Then there is alcohol. I have what I know is a completely messed up view of alcohol. It terrifies me what it might do to me. Logically I know that I can probably drink some alcohol and that I won’t be completely intoxicated or completely hung over, but I’m scared of both of those things.

I’m sitting in my hotel room writing this up trying not to chicken out.

I went over to a grocery store near the hotel. If anyone was watching me I’m sure I looked completely goofy walking up and down the aisles trying to make a selection (especially the pulling a potential choices off the shelf and reading the labels). I wanted something that wouldn’t make me gag and that I could open without a bottle opener or a cork screw. I really had no clue how much alcohol content is normal. 

I just ended up picking what I had in the picture and hoped for the best. I didn’t even know what 9.5% ABV meant (still don’t though I looked it up and feel like I at least lucked out and picked something that was reasonably strong 🤷)

My last attempt was with a red wine. My first obstacle was the cork that was in the bottle. Oh my god I had no idea it was so hard to get something like that out. Fortunately the room I was in did have a cork screw, but I had to manhandle the cork out of the bottle.

I’m sure that it should have been a no brainer that it would smell and taste like fermented grapes. I guess I thought that it would be grape juice with a kick. I gaged at the smell of it. I only took a sip and then spit it back out. I then noped out of it. I know that there could have been any number of things going on from I picked a cheap wine to that’s how it tastes and I just needed to acquire a taste for it. I just bowed out of that attempt as a complete failure.

I decided my next try would be something sweet/sour. 

I don’t know exactly why I feel like post this. I guess part of it is wanting to document my journey. Maybe to see what other people’s experiences are.

I always think it’s a little ironic that I’m experiencing these things so late in my life that so many others experienced in their early adult life.

1gjvefh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gjvefh,Scenery Themeing & Tinkering,"I’ve got a little park I’ve been working on using some of the tips and advice you see in a lot of great RCT YT videos to help make parks look a little more realistic.

This park has an “American Frontier” section that has two different coasters I tried to theme a little more real world like; Roughneck LSM - a launched Twister coaster meant to be themed like a frontier logging town, and All-American Nightmare - a cable lift Giga coaster that takes inspiration from the neighboring American Frontier, but has a color scheme meant to harken back to American Eagle from SFGA, this coaster also keeps up a pretty decent speed and is meant to have some solid negative g-forces and airtime like American Eagle does before the giant helixes slow it down.

Other things of note:

* Black Widow themed out a little more with trees with black and grey trunks, also some landscape variation to boost excitement.
* One of my favorite Hyper-Twister build outs I’ve done Roman Racers makes an appearance here but gets a slightly different treatment with a few Roman themed thrill rides mixed in around the track including an Enterprise, Bumper Boats, and Motion Simulator.
* Calling back to my Chicago roots, Dark Matter Coffee gets a little coffee and donuts shop sunk into the ground a bit with a covered sitting area.
* Sugar Shack Coffee & Sweets with neighboring Launched Freefall themed to it.
* Pirate Ship & Motion Simulator gets a little castle / Viking theme.
* Steel Mouse has some included themeing lightly expanded on and given its own little mini landscape park to sit in.

No ride videos on this one yet, this is just been a little on-going exercise in scenery and themeing more than ride construction, but Roughneck LSM and All-American Nightmare are custom designs, so I included a couple stats pages for fun to show the stats and the Excitment boost from the themeing. Continuity of themeing isn’t really a huge thing in this park (castles next to American Frontier and the a carefully landscaped park), but more just going with the flow on the realism tips.

Everything was wonderful until I found out how EASY he was cheating on me on the side. A friend  reached out to me saying he tried dating her & showed me screen shots, she said she's gonna message girls on his IG to make them aware so they can avoid him & his games. 

I lost it when I read her msgs, he was telling her the same things he'd tell me, planned similar dates..

So I found this FB page thats called "" are we dating the same guy "" & posted about him on there & multiple ppl replied! 1 said he goes out with new girls every weekend to bars, 1 said she dated him 1 day then stopped because he was too pushy about getting her to go to his place, 1 said she had 1 date but no connection & she mentioned that he really wanted a relationship badly but just didnt know how to go about it....(These girls all dated him before me) 

All the things I heard just drove me up the wall with how GREAT he fooled me to think we were something. After my friend messaged girls on his IG to give them awareness, I noticed he deleted 300 ppl off his IG (not exaggerating)...so NOW this makes me think he had a whole ass relationship behind my back & my friend said ALL the girls thanked her & blocked him, EXCEPT ONE GIRL who BLOCKED HER. BAM, TARGET....this was perhaps his main girl. He must had told her to block my friend. 

I dont get how he talked to me about seriousness on the phone, took me to a birthday dinner & we had the exclusive talk, he discussed he only wanted me to be seeing him & him only see me. We had talks of serious relationship development, he said he had serious intentions with me & swore his loyalty. All of this stuff scares the hell out of me with how easy a person can act like they love you and it ends up like this. I was so damn scared that I checked for all STD after learning about this shit, & Im still having anxiety that I caught something based on what ppl are saying about his actions, with how EAGER & desperate he is for dates. My tests came out negative luckily, but the paranoia is killing me. I feel so crushed with how a person can look you in the face & tell you they want you, & you both develop fun times, we would make a particular breakfast together in the morning, he would make me his cultural coffee, we would get to know each other, small sweet little things, he told me all about his family, and wanted to know about my goals and supported them & hyped me up. He didnt come off as a SHIT hole!! Im torn :/ im studying to be a doctor & i'm loosing SO much focus on my shit right now & I need someone to talk to & support me to let me know how to get over this :/ im sooo broken :/  I ghosted him when I found out he was talking to other girls and dating around, and he kept calling/texting me wondering why I stopped responding. He called and called. I answered nothing. This is the hardest break up ive done, its because I WANTED it work out, but the amount of shit that kept piling, I just am disbelief, what the hell went wrong, why did this happen the way it did? :/

1gjvd48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1gjvd48/i_couldnt_save_my_girlfriend/,I couldn’t save my girlfriend,"I’ve never posted to Reddit before. And I’m sure a lot of people won’t agree with my actions, but I just wanted to share my story. I guess I’m just hoping somehow someone with all the wisdom in the world will tell me what to do. 

I’ll give you a quick background on my girlfriend and our relationship. She’s an extreme dismissive avoidant, she’s very emotionally immature, and she’s been through a lot of trauma. Extremely physically abusive and neglectful parents, her brother was murdered a few years ago. Her parents take her entire paycheck, they are immigrants and don’t make good money. So yeah, she’s been through a lot.

We met shortly after her brother was murdered, and I think that strengthened our bond so much, as she needed someone, and to me it was my first relationship. I was 20, she was 25. It started off electric and me I was sort of stuck in this hero mentality. I loved her so much I just wanted to see her happy so I did EVERYTHING. My entire paycheck for 3 years I would give to her, every dollar. I did 100% of her schoolwork, I would come into work on my days off, and do her assignments while she was on the clock, so she could relax, I got her little sister into college, I paid her family’s rent when her dad lost his job and got him a new one. This is on top of all regular relationship dynamics, affection, emotional support, dates, flowers, etc. I feel very deeply into this masculine/feminine role. She was naturally very feminine and I am naturally very masculine so it fit, but attachment styles ended up winning. Her self sabotaging issues, her avoidance, her CPTSD, my anger issues all boiled over into this intensely loving but hellish relationship. 

Still we loved each other. I was 2 months away from proposing to her, I was looking at rings and making plans to buy an apartment. By this time I was 23, just graduated. I forgot to mention earlier, although I was very close with her family, we kept our relationship secret because of our religion. One day we got into an intense argument, which was normal for us. But this time, when I woke up and tried to apologize I saw I was blocked on everything. I gave it a few days , thinking she just needed space, but she never unblocked me. In 3 years we had never gone over half a day without speaking, no matter how bad our arguments got.

On the third day, I texted her little sister, telling her to tell my girlfriend to unblock me. She did, and what she said to me completley destroyed me. She told me that she married someone else, that she never loved me, that I was never anything more than just a friend to her, and that she was happy to be finally be married. Needless to say her words crushed me. And this is probably a good time to explain that her parents and extremely traditional, poorly educated people. They actually tried to force her into two marriages before this one while we were dating, both of those failed. My girlfriend due to her immaturity, every time we would argue she would tell me she’s going to accept her next arranged marriage, so of course I stopped believing it after a while. And this time I didn’t either. Her words completley crushed me, but I didn’t believe it was real. Probably my own defenses taking over. 

I asked her to meet the next day to get my credit cards back. Obviously I didn’t care, I just wanted to see her. She agreed, and when we met she wasn’t lashing out anymore, but she wasn’t letting me touch her and she kept insisting we were never anything more than friends. I broke down in tears, she softened a bit, she gave me one last kiss and told me to pray for her that she would have an easy life. 

Even then, I couldn’t bring myself to believe she was married, my denial was at an extreme.  This was early June, for the next 30 days we spoke sporadically, her reaching out when she needed something , one time she was crying, and me being angry because I didn’t believe she was married and thought she was just trying to hurt me. I still dreamed of her every night. On July 4 I travel back to my home country for the summer, and as soon as I land one of our old coworkers sends me a text that says “Call me when you land ASAP”. I knew it was about my girl, I told her to just send me screenshots. She sent me screenshots of my girlfriend in a wedding dress, and another man holding her in his arms.

We’ve all experienced heartbreak before, but I truly don’t believe there’s a lot of people out there who can relate to this pain. My girl of 3 years, my first love, the woman who I saw my future with, the woman who I worked 15 hour shifts for 7 days a week while balancing both our college classes to make happy. I would cut off my arms to make this woman happy, and right in front of me is her in a wedding dress, and another man holding her in his arms. 

I immediately reached out to her, and we reestablished regular contact. I was able to find out that her parents went through her phone, found out we were dating, and rejected me. Because I’m from a different country and I’m significantly younger. They pressured her into marrying this guy. She went through bouts of depression during her engagement (we were still dating), she cut her hair short, fought against the marriage, but to no avail. This marriage went through, that day we had our argument and she blocked me on everything was 2 days before her marriage. 

But in early July we did reestablish contact again, I was just doing what I can to make things easier for her, and holding onto her as desperately as I could. As stupid as it sounds, I believed this whole thing would just boil over, and she just needed time to see we still loved each other and should fight for each other, and everything would be okay. So I did what I could to support her, paying for coffee, helping her with work, checking on her, etc. She was obviously in emotional turmoil, oscillating between leaning on me one second, then lashing out the next. This continued until one day she said she needed help paying off her tickets. 



She said her husband gets mad when it comes to money, and this guy, he’s genuinely a terrible person. From what I know about him, he’s broke, immature, type of guy who pays for Instagram followers, broke up with his girlfriend to marry mine, and eventually (we’ll get to this) cheated on my girlfriend. So yeah, a real piece of work. 

Anyway, I saw it as an opportunity to bring her closer to me and further from her husband, so I happily paid $250 for her tickets. That night as we were talking, she said she was going to have to block me again, stating that she couldn’t be disrespectful to her marriage. I know it’s stupid, but I still saw us as dating at the time. I couldn’t keep my cool anymore, we got into a huge fight. The pain of everything piled up. She ended up fainting, and her parents found out we were still talking, obviously it didn’t go so well for her. After this day, we forgave each other, she was kind to me for a few more days but I think this argument solidified her “choice” in moving forward with the marriage. She asked for help with more tickets and few later, which I did, and a work assignment, and after that a complete 180. 

She started getting visibly annoyed with me every time I reached out. One day we were having another intense conversation, and I said I was going to buy her an apartment soon so she could have a safe place to live. She basically said why would you, he’s by husband not a stranger, I love him and I’m going to have a kid with him. 

I know everyone is going to grill me for this, but I brushed these comments off. I thought she was going through intense emotional turmoil, which honestly she might have been, and my unwavering support and ability to withstand everything would change everything. So from July 21 to August 11, this continued, I would check on her, send her gift cards for her coffee, and she would get annoyed and tell me to chill, although she would continue using the gift cards. 

On August 11, while I was out, I saw her holding hands with her husband. This is kind of when it hit me, that she was genuinely moving on with her new life, and that our love was genuinely worthless. I texted her when I got home, her response was defensive “excuse me that’s my husband, what’s the point of you even bringing this up.”

I remember that day looking in the mirror and having an intense conversation with myself. This was my girlfriend, in a marriage she didn’t want, conforming, doing what she has to to keep the peace. Am I going to let her suffer her future with this man because of the pain I’m I , or am I going to brush my pain to the side and find a way to get her out of this. I chose to keep fighting, but I was going to have to undergo immense work.

I came up with a plan, first I was going to go no contact for a month. In this month I was going to work on my emotional control, she needed emotional safety from me, not judgement for trying to make the best out of her situation. I was going to buy her an apartment, and I was going to subtly sabotage her marriage. All these combined would fix everything, so I got to work.

I did run into her holding hands with her husband one more time, it was like a movie scene. She stepped into the elevator turned around and saw me, we held eye contact until the elevator door closed.

I reached out to her a few days after, breaking no contact, just telling her that I’m not upset with her and that she holds a special place in my heart, and that no matter what I’m always here for her. She gave a polite but distant response, success I thought. With her extreme avoidant style if she’s responding that means she hasn’t given up on me. A week later I messaged her asking if she needed anything, no response, but she did use the gift card I sent her. I didn’t know at the time but she was getting ready to move into her husbands home. This was mid September. 

On October 7, I got an email that her student loans were due soon. Since I used to take care of everything for her, my email was under her account. I used it as an excuse to reach out to her. This time there was a noticeable shift, she was extremely grateful for me reaching out, thanking me, and asking for advice on how to handle her loans. She even brought up seeing each other to work on it, but said she would ask her husband. At first I denied and said I would take care of it from my laptop, I didn’t want another man’s permission to meet “my woman”. 

A week later I reached out to her, I had taken care of a few things on my end and was updating her. She was a bit more closed off this time, citing that she was having a lot of problems at work and revealed that she might be pregnant. Listen, I don’t care what heartbreak you’ve been through. Your girlfriend of 3 years was not pregnant with another man’s child 4 months after you broke up. I can’t even begin to describe to you how that broke me, I felt the most unimaginable pain for about 2 days, and then nothing. I just went numb. And I’ve been numb ever since. 

But upon finding out she might be pregnant, my plan to sabotage her marriage went underway. Given that her husband cheated on his girlfriend to marry mine, I knew he was a man of no morals. I sent one of those loyalty testers to DM him. At first I told her to wait, I wanted to wait until I secured an apartment for her. But of course, hearing she might be pregnant didn’t give me another option. If I was going to save her from this marriage, I had to do it now.


So around October 15 she starts messaging him, and he’s being responsive. At the same time, my girlfriend is getting closer to me , she called me for the first time since her marriage saying that we are going to meet up but she’s just been under a lot of stress and busy. I reassured her, I wasn’t blocked on iMessage anymore, she was thanking me for the gift cards I was sending. Everything was perfect, I was going to get my girlfriend back. She wouldn’t be this open with me again if her husband was meeting her needs. She was growing more disillusioned with marriage and closer to me, and her husband was flirting with another woman. Everything is going perfect. 

By October 30, her husband has agreed to go out with my loyalty tester, and back to her place after. He’s flirted with her, FaceTimed her, and I have screenshots of everything. If I haven’t crossed moral boundaries already, here is where I crossed them immensely. I made sure that he agreed to go on a date on November 2, her late brothers birthday. I hoped it would hit her parents so hard, they would realize what a mistake they made forcing her to marry this piece of garbage and demand a divorce. I dirtied my hands, but I swear, I was so numb by this point it wasn’t about us getting together, it was about saving her from a future with this garbage of a man. 

The night before her brothers birthday, I made a groupchat of her and her family members from a fake number pretending to be the loyalty tested, and was as intense as possible in revealing his infidelity. I warned her of STD’s, mentioned his disrespect in planning the infidelity on her late brothers birthday, etc.

It obviously hit her and her family very hard. And as guilty as I felt, I felt I finally won. No way could this marriage continue with his blatant disrespect to her and her entire family. I was wrong.

She texted me a few days later saying her life had been horrible. I tried to be there for her, of course knowing why but playing stupid. Then she said I know it was you. I continued playing dumb, but she knows me too well I guess. She went into a rant, asking me why I would hurt her on a sacred day. How much I hurt her family, that she was happy and I was ruining it. She revealed she had spent that night in the hospital, and that she was in fact pregnant. I didn’t try to defend myself, we had a semi intense conversation. I was in control and honest, I told her I loved her, I didn’t want to lose her to this life. That clearly her husband was a terrible person, he doesn’t respect her or her family she holds so dear. I think not defending myself and clearly stating my intentions reached her, or maybe it was just her avoidance, but she seemed to understand as many lines as I crossed it’s because I wanted what was best for her. She just did a 180 mid conversation and went from attacking to me saying she forgives me and joking around. She seemed to me partly in denial, she said her husband knew it was a test from the start. I asked her if she truly believed that, but she deflected saying either way they’ve moved on from it.

So here I am. And I finally understand. My girlfriend after a life of trauma and abuse is seeking not love, not to thrive, but just stability. Her husband got her away from her abusive parents, she’s pregnant, in a culture that looks down on divorce, with no money for her own. Her parents are satisfied and excited for their grandchild. She doesn’t want me to save her, I thought the infidelity would break apart her marriage. But I didn’t take into account this isn’t a marriage of love, it’s one of survival and stability for her. So long as he’s not demanding or abusive, then she doesn’t see a reason to leave. Our love wasn’t enough, I wasn’t enough. 

I sent her one last message, telling her I love her, and that I want what’s best for her, and that her child deserves a good man as a father, and that I can’t stay in the background supporting her because it’s only making it easier for her to stay in this life. And that this was my goodbye forever. She said thank you and that she was happy, I didn’t respond and then she said take care and goodbye.

So here I am. If I was financially secure before I could’ve bought her a safe place to live, she wouldn’t have had to go through this marriage. If I hadn’t waited to do the loyalty test, I could’ve ended this marriage before she had her pregnancy tying her down. And now after spending October promising her I would always be there for her, I’m now leaving her to her fate. August - September I was cutting myself like crazy, I couldn’t take the pain of not being able to protect my girlfriend. And October I stopped because I saw light for the first time, now I realize how much I failed. I only made things worse. Why. Why did I fail at every single aspect of protecting her.

I did a year of eikaiwa work in Kansai over two decades ago and I have been back for several trips since then so I'm an experienced Japan tourist. This time, I picked a region I've not visited before. From next week, I'm going to be making my way between **Izumo, Matsue, Kurayoshi, Tottori and Kinosaki Onsen**.

  
I have done a LOT of pre-trip research but I **am interested to hear any recommendations\* you may have for these places**, beyond the obvious main tourism draws like Izumo Taisha, Matsue Castle and Tottori Sand Dunes. 



Also two specific questions:



**North shore of Shinji-ko along the Ichibata Dentetsu**

Would you recommend stopping off anywhere along the Ichibata line when I shift between Izumo and Matsue? Vogel Matsue Park, or nice viewpoints, good cafes etc. 



**Between Tottori and Kinosaki Onsen**

Any scenic or interesting stops along the San'in Mainline here? I know there are little boat excursions in the summer but they have finished now. A lunch stop? Viewpoints not far from a station? Takenohama despite it being November, for example? If not, I can certainly just go direct to Kinosaki to hit that terrace cafe.



Thank you for your thoughts!

The machine ground mercilessly, shredding all of it into thousands of tiny pieces. The heat, at 190 degrees, radiated close to my hand. The grinding's melody made my head hurt.

Then it stopped as I emptied the contents into a paper filter and began to douse it. I patiently waited as the coffee dripped slowly into the pour-over. It's the only way to drink coffee, especially with a terrible hangover.

As I sipped my coffee, I glanced out the window at my backyard. Something was amiss—several things, actually. But one stood out: a dark gray stone structure had been erected.

I opened the window and yelled at the small group gathered outside, ""Hey, what the hell are you doing in my backyard?""

""It's for the ceremony,"" a bookish man shouted back. What the hell? I marched out the back door and saw nearly a dozen people, dressed in flowery shirts and flowy garments, circling the structure.

“Get this thing out of here!” I shouted as all the weird hippies paused suddenly, giving me a blank glare. “Also, all of you get out of my yard, too!”

“We can’t do that,” the man replied.

“And why is that?”

“Because the concrete is almost set.”

“Do what now?”

“Well, you see a structure this size would need something to stabilize it.”

“I know what the hell concrete is for, but why is it in my yard?”

“Because you told us we could,” he replied, waving to others who started circling the brick and humming in unison. The symphony of weirdness made my head throb even more.

“No, I didn’t.”

“We had an entire conversation about it.”

“This is the first time I’ve ever seen you, dude.”

“No, we were here last night.” 

“Alright, I’m calling the cops,” I said as I turned to head back inside the house. The bookish man trudged behind me, with a bit of concern and nervousness. “Seriously, last chance to get the hell out of my backyard.”

 “I wouldn’t do that if I were you.” 

“And why the hell not?” 

“Because we made a blood pact while you were singing Kansas and crying.” 

Goddammit, I was *really* drunk last night.

“What blood pact?” I said scanning my body to see if I had any cuts on my body, as the man watched me as if I was the strange one. “I don’t see any cuts on me, I think you are lying.” 

“We made a deal when we showered in Ned’s blood.”

“Come again?” 

“We made a deal.” 

“Not the part I am focused on right now.” 

“It’s starting!” Someone yelled as the bookish man turned and ran to the structure. Everyone’s mouths were agape but mine, as I took another sip of coffee. It reverberated as strange noises began to come from it, as I saw what seemed like a hand reach out of it.

1gjv8ty,https://www.reddit.com/r/BRCC_Stock/comments/1gjv8ty/thoughts_on_q3_results/,Thoughts on Q3 results,"Comments on today's press release. The earnings call isn't until tomorrow, which I hope sheds light on some of what I address below.

Things I don't like from today's results:

1. The CEO reported BRCC ""continues to perform well,"" but 2024 Q3 revenue fell 2.3% from 2023 Q3 and the company revised its revenue expectations downward for the year. This is the second downward revision already this year: from $460M to $415M in Q2 and from $415M to $395M in Q3 (at the high range). Why doesn't management just come right out and say results failed to meet expectations? The company has repeatedly over promised and under delivered on its annual revenue target over the years. I wish management would get a clue and become more conservative in its forecasting. Over promising and under delivering is a sure way to turn investors off--the stock always drops precipitously when the company revises revenue downward. The deeper fear is that this pattern of overestimating revenue reflects management doesn't really know its own business.
2. Outpost revenue fell 11% year-over-year to a paltry $5.5M, but the company added 3 new stores during this period meaning the company is earning a lot less per store. While outpost revenue has never contributed a meaningful amount to total receipts, this stream fell an incredible 28% in Q2. What concerns me here is what this drop signals about the brand's appeal. While the coffee shops garner high ratings in Google reviews, customers just aren't buying coffee at its stores. The company did not comment on this in their Q2 release. It's a question I think they need to address. We have seen other companies like Starbucks and Monster address stagnant sales in the context of inflation that continues impacting consumers, but I'm not aware of BRCC directly addressing its results the same way.
3. The press release offers no clues about the revenue generated through its partnership with Keurig or the status of the company getting into new wholesale partners.
4. I wish the company had more cash on hand ($7M currently) compared to its debt obligations ($15M in the short term, $50M in the long-term).

Things I like from today's results:

1. Although wholesale revenue increased only 3.5%, I'll take the increase. I pray the company still is not selling or just recently started selling in the wholesale partners it has on deck that it mentioned during its Q2 earnings call. Why? Because today's results would mean the company is generating more revenue from about the same number of stores, which is a good trend.
2. Total revenue fell 2% year-over-year. I was actually expecting a bigger fall. 
3. Finally, direct-to-consumer revenue appears to be stabilizing. DTC has been falling each quarter for more than a year. In Q2, it was $30M. In Q3, it as $29M, a decrease of only 3%. That this stream is reducing churn is a positive sign. It also appears that the decrease in outpost revenue is stabilizing, too. Outpost revenue in Q2 was $5.3M and in Q3 it actually slightly increased to $5.5M. Although outpost revenue is essentially meaningless to the bottom line, I still like that the downward trend reversed this quarter.
4. The company continues to control costs. Operating expenses remain under pretty good control. Continuing this discipline is critical given revenue is tight and the company has to pay $16M of its total \~$65M debt off.
5. Release of energy drinks line. I'm pleased to see Keurig Dr Pepper will not only distribute these drinks but it will also manufacture them. When it comes to making and distributing drinks, Dr Pepper knows what it is doing. Hopefully, Dr Pepper's involvement will help BRCC avoid the quality control issues it experienced rolling out its RTD coffee drinks. I'm also excited about Dr Pepper's involvement because it gives me faith these energy drinks will actually taste good. A company can push marketing, but at the end of the day no consumer will want to buy something that doesn't taste good. I pray these energy drinks do just that. If they do, then they could become a meaningful growth catalyst for the company. I'll be listening for more details about these drinks including initial reviews from people who have tried them and where to buy them on the earnings call.",1,1730770300.0,BRCC_Stock,0,1.0,False

1gjv5qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1gjv5qo/cat_lethargic_but_only_in_morning_routine/,Cat Lethargic but only in morning? Routine associated with vet visits? ,"**Species**: Cat

**Age**: 16yo

**Sex/Neuter Status**: Female, Spayed

**Breed**: Domestic Tuxedo

**Body Weight**: 9.3lbs

**History**: 

My 16 year old cat has had a chronic anal gland issue for the past 4ish years. She’s had a gland abscess and rupture (with very little warning) 3 times in the past 4 years, once in 2020, once in 2023, and once the morning of 9/30/2024. We got her abscess cleaned and treated with antibiotics, two follow up vet appointments on the morning of 10/07 and the morning 10/14 to ensure she was healing properly. After the vet visit on 10/14, we were given the all clear and that she was healing well and wouldn’t need to return unless something changes. Important note - she does not handle car rides or vet appointments well at all (lots of crying and vomiting in the car). I started her on high fiber prescription food around \~10/17. After I noticed the pattern of weird behavior in the morning, I took her to the vet (11/1) where we got bloodwork done - results below. At the abscess cleaning appointment, she weighed 9.65 pounds. A month later on 11/1, she weighed 9.35 pounds. 

**Clinical Signs:** 

Over the past 2.5 weeks (roughly since the third vet visit on 10/14), I have noticed that she acts a little lethargic but really only in the morning. She typically has an extremely regular routine - she’ll meet me in my bedroom after I get up and hang out while I do my morning routine, then she will escort me downstairs for breakfast (she is very food motivated), where she’ll eat. After she eats and watches me make coffee (she‘s adorable) she’ll either sleep on the couch or on her blanket in my bedroom for a few hours and will alternate between the two locations every couple of hours. Once I get home, she’ll beg for food until I feed her and typically snuggle up on the couch until dinner time (8pm) where she’ll eat, then she’ll sleep on the couch. 

Several times in the past 2.5 weeks (but not daily - some days are normal), she meets me in my bedroom in the morning, but by the time I finish my morning routine she’s either laying down and I have to coax her downstairs or she’s hiding under the bed. Each time this has happened, I’ve brought food upstairs where she’s eaten within \~10 minutes. 

However, she’s never been lethargic in the afternoon. When I get home, I’m always greeted by her energetic self and she always eats a normal amount at dinner time. She’s also never hidden in the afternoon - only in the morning. 

I took her in for an appointment last Friday, where she got an exam and bloodwork. Bloodwork was mostly normal, but the sample was clotted (so it showed crazy low platelets) and there were 3 items that were very slightly outside of the normal range. The only things outside the normal range were hemoglobin (16.7g/dL), lymphocytes (0.718K/uL), and BUN (39mg/dL). 

At that same vet visit on Friday, the vet expressed her other anal gland (not the one that abscessed recently) and there was some white pus-like material. The vet tech also observed that she was breathing really heavily and asked me to keep an eye on her breathing rate at home - I’ve measured her breathing rate many times per day over the weekend and it’s reliably been between 28 and 32 breaths per minute. 

Other than that, she’s eating and drinking regularly. No vomiting and I have not noticed any diarrhea. Grooming regularly and is energetic in the afternoon.

Could she have associated my morning routine with vet visits? Each of the vet visits in the past month have been between 8-9am and I have a fairly regular weekday morning routine. That’s the only thing that I can think of that’s causing this. I’ve spent a little under $2000 on her vet appointments in the past month, so just trying to see if it’s worth doing further diagnostics like x-rays or ECG’s or if she just takes after me and is a ball of anxiety :)

**Duration:** Past 2.5 weeks

Vet okayed closer to an hour then the 5 minute rule because he's small and high energy breed. This dog does not stop. No matter what I do he just goes and goes and goes. There is not a moment in time he just sits and chills with me. No snuggles. No couch time no moment I am not constantly up his butt. I cannot do a single thing unless he is crated. I do plan on doing disc with him. My first sport dog. We throw it around but again puppy, he cannot do much physically yet. I do bully sticks and lick mats, does not stop to eat them he devours lick mats and runs around with the bully sticks throwing them. We train, we train in public, we go to shops, and coffee places and sit outside. I am at wits end here. I have had dogs and puppies my whole life. Never dealt with this before. Can anyone think of anything to help? Breeder just says he's high drive it will hopefully get better when he can do more, crate him more, try calming gummies basicy🤷‍♀️  I want to enjoy my dog so badly I do. I've been putting so much work into him every single day but he just will not slow down. I put him down for naps. Sometimes he sleeps but sometimes he doesn't. If he's literally completely wiped like going ALL DAY he will settle and nap for a while. Otherwise it's constant insanity. I cannot devote every single waking moment of my day to entertaining him. I can do hours but not the entire day.  I am not a trainer, but I'm decent enough the class we took the trainer told me I know more than 90 percent of the people who come through his doors.  Not sure  that means much but just to explain that I am not just some random who bought a puppy with no idea what it's like.  Any ideas for getting some extra energy out that's not physical I haven't heard about since all my enrichment ideas don't seem to do much?  I was thinking scent but that's something I don't have much experience with. ",1,1730769751.0,puppy101,3,1.0,False

I’ve noticed the coffee isn’t as hot as it used to be now. It’s ready to drink at room temperature pretty much straight away. Also, when brewing it as a mug it doesn’t seem to brew as much as usual, only about 3/4 of what it used to brew.

Any suggestions on what to do? Would it help to perform a clean of the machine (which I did do already)?

It’s frustrating because this is the second refurbished machine I’ve gotten from them. I asked if I can just get a new one and they said they don’t offer that… ",1,1730769730.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

I'm 27, EST time zone, and I am from the state of New Jersey in the USA.

**Below is a list of my goals for this year (the next 365 days). However, I am only working towards only 1 goal (or area of my life) at a time.** You cannot change your whole life and all your habits overnight. I learned that the hard way.... smh. It is best to focus on improving one area of your life at a time. Right now I'm focused on goal #1 and I am succeeding at the moment (as of Day 4) but **I could really use a great accountability partner that's also super passionate about building a great life. It would be great to discuss our progress and our failures, encourage one another, problem solve specific issues together, have meaningful conversations about a wide variety of things relevant to self-growth, and perhaps compete together in fitness, academic, or financial challenges.**

**Current Goals From November 2024-November 2025 \[Subject to Revision Over Time\]**

**1.** **Eat 100% Healthy** and Follow my Nighttime Routine Every Night!  
**2. Start applying for marketing jobs**  
**3.** **Move to a new city for a marketing job** \*(\****I'm currently living with my parents in the middle of nowhere:*** *semi-rural, nothing to do, no culture, no university, no events, no scenes, nothing.)*  
**4. Start dating again:** Politely, and gentlemanly ask any single woman you find attractive, that you see in public or at the gym or at an event, and ask her if she'd like to grab a cup of coffee for a casual date after testing the waters first with some playfulness and then flirting a bit if she seems interested in talking to me. I got a lot of dates and girlfriends doing that in the past. *(And use Tinder again, I suppose?)*  
**5. Find a girl I could earnestly fall in love with and who could potentially be ""the one""** and ask her to be my girlfriend after she drops a hint that she wants a relationship  
**6. Get in the best physical shape of my entire life**  
**7 Follow the Bulletproof Diet starting next month**  
**8. Quit vaping**  
**9. Start reading books again** and summarizing what you learned afterwards on video to improve recall (the best way to learn is to teach, since explaining something you learned brings it all together in your mind)  
**10. Build the best support structure possible for my self-improvement:** Find about 4-5 IRL friends who are all aiming up in life and who inspire me to become my best self... my real self! I hope I can also coordinate together with some of them on entrepreneurial ventures

**My Story:** I've been into lifelong self-improvement for 15 years but got wrecked pretty badly by a terrible, horrific codependent relationship with a girl that threatened to unalive herself if I broke up with her, and so I stayed with her for 5 years trying to ""fix her."" It was hell. I was depressed and stopped taking care of myself because I felt trapped. Don't ever date a ""project"" regardless of how ""hot she is"" in terms of her physical appearance or how she's really a nice person that deserved better in life but got screwed up by her parents, or lack thereof. That shit means nothing if they just tear you down instead of lifting you up. Women with mental health or alcohol  need a therapist, a mentor, and to take responsibility for their own lives; not someone to fix their problems for them so they don't have to become an adult and outgrow their codependency issues. Don't repeat my mistakes. You can't ""fix"" another person. Even therapists don't fix people; they just give people the tools they need to work on themselves. The same is true of AA, although AA also offers a community of people willing to help you.",2,1730769692.0,GetMotivatedBuddies,0,1.0,False
1gjuzjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/gayrelationships/comments/1gjuzjk/i_fell_in_love_with_a_sex_addict/,I fell in love with a sex addict,"Hey everyone. I’ve never really used reddit but I’m so torn up about this and looking for some advice. Strap in cuz this is a whole novel. I (22) have known this guy (24) since last February. We were both just looking for hookups online but ended up talking and long story short we spent a month talking everyday and going on dates once or twice a week. What we had felt really special to me, so I asked the dreaded ""what are we"" question. I said I wanted a monogamous LTR (I know, I probably shouldn’t have been on apps but I was thinking with the wrong head) and he said he was looking for something more casual and not monogamous. I wasn't mad; if he wanted to be non-monogamous that was his prerogative, but I told him I couldn't do that, and I was really heartbroken to find out he was seeing other people. I decided to end things there.

Flash forward to the beginning of April. We both kind of reached out to each other and said we really missed each other. We met up for coffee where we basically said nothing has changed for either of us in terms of what we want, but that we miss each other a lot. Basically we just ignored that fact that we weren't really compatible. We spent 3 really beautiful months going on dates, talking everyday, and opening up to each other. Every moment made me so happy; from the romantic dinners to the deep talks to the long, comfortable silences while we held each other. While we didn’t say it at the time, we both agreed that we had fallen in love with each other. At the end of June he invited me to an event that was taking place the day before he was leaving to go out of town for a month and a half. He said he was excited for me to meet a friend of his. I got a bad feeling about it all after meeting this friend, and called him later that night only to find out that he had been seeing this guy since January. I was absolutely heartbroken. I guess I didn’t have the right to make this assumption since we had both said nothing changed in terms of what we’re looking for, but I had assumed that if he was seeing anyone else he would have told me because he knew how much that hurt me the last time. We both agreed that we had fallen in love, that we saw this becoming a long term relationship, and that we don’t want to stop seeing each other. But we were just too different, and I decided to end things there for good.

Once again, flash forward to about a month ago. He reached out to me saying he thinks about me everyday and still has feelings for me and that I made him really happy. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t feel the same way. It had been 3 months since we ended things but the love I felt for him still hadn’t gone anywhere, and I couldn’t stop thinking about him. But I told him what I had said before; that we're too different. He explained that he wants a monogamous relationship, but he was trying to be more casual this year after a rough breakup, which I respect. However, he said that feeling changed after meeting me. Basically what I was hearing was that we were finally on the same page with what we wanted, which is what I had wanted for months.

We decided to get coffee (I know, deja vu). I can’t even describe how good it felt just to see him again. I missed everything about him so much it was killing me. He apologized for how we ended things, and said he wants things to be different. I made sure that he wasn't just convincing himself we wanted the same thing so that we could be together, and he assured me that wasn't the case. I was hoping that because we were finally on the same page we could start an actual, committed relationship, but he explained to me that he can't be in a relationship because he’s realized that he has a sex addiction. I won't say I was surprised. I knew how important sex was to him, and I started to suspect he might have an issue with it when he told me once that ""if you're not having good sex, life isn't worth living"". I admitted that I was kind of insecure about our sex life while we were together because I felt like he wanted more than what I could give. I asked if we were to date would he cheat on me, and he said he doesn't know but he doesn't want to hurt me again. He said he was trying to get help, but was having trouble because of how expensive it is. After coffee, we went back to his place. We talked more, and just held each other for a couple hours, mourning the fact that we couldn't be together because of this. Basically where we left things is we really like each other and miss each other and want to be together, but he has to take time to work on this before we could have a relationship, and maybe someday in the future we can finally make things work.

It's been a couple weeks since then, and I'm just not sure what to do. What worries me the most is I'm not sure he'll be able/motivated to get the help he needs. I don't think he really has anyone that he's opened up to and who's supporting him through this, and I'm not sure he'll get therapy, since he'd have to go through the trouble of finding a copay assistance program. I just wish I could fix him somehow because I care about him so much and want him to be happy and healthy, but also (more selfishly) so we can be together. I also know he's still on the apps because I saw he was active when I went to delete my account a few days ago (trying VERY hard to resist the urge to lurk and see if he's on there). I understand it's an almost uncontrollable impulsive behavior for him, but I feel like such an idiot pining over him and waiting for him to be ready for a relationship while he's (potentially) out sleeping with random people. I know I shouldn't just wait around for him and I should probably move on, but I don't know how to when my feelings for him just won't go away, and there's a chance we could be together in the future. It's such a complex situation and I honestly am not even sure how I feel. I'm so sad, angry, worried, guilty, but most of all heartbroken. I just love him so much.

TL;DR: Guy and I really like each other and want to be together, but his sex addiction, which he admits is a problem that he wants to get help with, is keeping us apart.",0,1730769545.0,gayrelationships,3,0.5,False

Nagbumble ako before since gusto ko lang din maalis sa boredom ko plus ready naman na ako for a commitment after being in a 3-year situationship na never akong binigyan ng label. (Wandot isstory time ko to eme). That day na nagchat siya sa akin, I just had my biggest academic heartbreak noon -- with the chance of not graduating that semester. He helped me by providing company, he gave me my fave food and made me try tea para hindi na ako coffee-dependent. He helped me regain confidence with my looks and my capability. Grabe yung paghahype up niya sa akin, kasi alam niyang yun yung kailangan ko during the times na nagsastruggle ako.

*Right there and then I knew I love this person, and will always love for the rest of my life.*

Long story short, I successfully redefended my thesis about 3 weeks after our first talk! We became officially bf-gf a month after my downfall, and since then ay very significant na yung date na nareject thesis ko haha!

Days went by and we're doing well. Nag-aaway minsan pero never sumagi sa isip ko na hihiwalayan ko siya, or hihiwalayan nya ako dahil sa mga conflict namin. His family is so welcoming and supportive, na they are continually helping me in my job hunt.

Almost five months into the relationship, I still feel the same queen treatment from him. He visits me, he makes me try new food establishments, he assures me of our future, and he puts me closer to God ulit. Sobrang laking pasasalamat ko kay Lord kasi nga He gave me this man I can call my own. I feel so safe whenever I'm with him, and I never had to change anything about me para lang mahalin niya.

# CHAPTER ONE

# ANGELA

# The Fallen

*There are only six Lattice’s. This is a well-known fact among the islands. But why did the Progenitors gift us with only six? Why not five? Why not Seven? The answer to this question has innumerable answers, the most common among them being that 6 is something of an important number to the Progenitors. 6 Races, 6 true Mist-Eyes, 6 Islands, 6 obelisks. Another point of proof to the theory will require me to dabble in the slightest bit of Lattice Science. Firstly, is the fact that the 6 lattices are easily broken down into three groups of two as follows.*



||Transmission|Transition|Translation|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Projection|Pair|Shield|Charge|
|Internal|Signal|Lift|Heat|



*Secondly, each of the groups can also easily be separated into internal or external. As in whether or not the lattice’s effect is projected outside the lattice, or entirely contained within. This proves at the very least, that the lattice table is filled out, and no more groups exist.*

*While some would see all of this as mere conjecture, I raise you the last sentence on the first obelisk. Carved there by the very progenitors themselves.*

*“The Six shall bring civilization back from the brink, and restore the former glory of True Humanity.”*

*This simple sentence is what prompted the first Tinker to construct the first Airship and begin the hunt for the Lattices, and what prompted Augustus Solar to declare the hunt ended after the Paired lattice was found. Because there are only six Lattices. And that is all that there ever will be.*

\---

Angela woke to the screaming of the mist alarm. The alarm was terrifying, a high-pitched pulsating wail that was designed to instill fear and panic into the minds of the uninitiated. To the sailor, it was not the alarm itself that instilled the fear, but what the alarm meant. Angela pushed aside her rack curtain and swung out of her bunk. The small room was filled with people scrambling to get their mist suits on as quickly as possible. She reached for her own and started pulling it on. A frantic minute passed, her hands doing up the seals and clasps near automatically after years of practice. She turned to her neighbor and started checking on their seals and clasps. She felt someone patting her own. It was reassuring to have someone to check and once it was done, her heart rate eased considerably. They at least had some protection against the mist now. She spent some time strapping her sheathed halfblade to her belt and strode out the door.

On the speakers mounted to the overhead in various places, she heard the muffled voice of the ship’s Executive officer. “Major Incursion, Major Incursion in the number five chiller room. The ship is sealed and manned for mist incursion. Time: 1 minute, forty-five seconds.”

Upon hearing that last part, Angela relaxed. She allowed her breathing to slow as she sheathed her blade that had appeared in her hand at some point. The ship was awake now. Angela could hear the muffled thumps of her officers getting dressed. Annoyingly, she wasn’t the first one out. The Navigator was across the hall, emerging from her own bunkroom.

The Navigator nodded, strapping her blade to her belt.

“Captain.”

Angela nodded in kind and they both began walking away from the officer battle bunkrooms.  The metal passageways of the ship were small, barely big enough for two people to pass shoulder to shoulder. Various pipes and electrical cables ran through the ceiling and walls. They went up one steep staircase and turned left. To the uninitiated, most ships were an insane warren of passageways and pipes. They often had to get escorted or risked becoming lost in one of the bilges somewhere. By contrast, a sailor could navigate their ship practically blindfolded. After passing through a mist-tight door, they arrived at the passageway to the ships forward Bastion. It was located in the center of the ship, well protected against any stray railgun rounds that made it past the shields.  Back in the day, the Bastion had been a place where sailors could relax and take off their breathing protection while traversing the mist. But over time as technology evolved, shipbuilders started designing ships with all compartments sealed against the mist.  Now the Bastion was the nerve center of the entire ship where most of the ship's functions were controlled. Set into the bulkhead at the end of the corridor was a massive metal hatch, easily 3 meters wide.  Situated on the bulkhead above the door was a steel placard.

The placard contained an image that was scribed into the bare metal by a deft hand. It depicted a grey and blue bird of legend, wings spread, flying up into the sky. Four bright trails of white fire followed after it. Below it was the ship’s name.

LTS *Phoenix*.

Under the name, the ship's motto had been carved with the tip of something very hot, and very sharp. The letters had been rubbed with a type of blue glowstone that made them vibrant against the bare metal of the placard.

 *“Ashes to Embers, Embers to Flame.”*

 Angela walked up to the hatch and pressed the intercom button mounted on the bulkhead next to it.

“Captain and the Navigator, requesting entry into the Prime Bastion.”

There was a ratcheting click, and the door started to ponderously swing open. Angela quite liked how thick the door was, one and a half meters thick. She shuffled through the door, bending herself almost in half to fit, and stood up on the other side.  The room was relatively small and entirely packed with equipment and people. It was a tiered stadium design, each subsequent tier having consoles that controlled different aspects of the ship's systems. At the front of a room was a massive VFD panel that displayed various information about the ship. The most important being the damage control board and engine room status. Dominating the center of the vertical panel was the Oculus a giant glass sphere that assisted with navigation and reference in the mist.

The lowest tier was the engineering tier, and the officers there controlled the ships steam powered generators, electric systems, trim, list, and the all-important Lift

The second tier contained the pilot's chair, directly in the center. On either side were sensors and weapons consoles. The upper tier contained the Conn, a raised circular section ringed with a railing with the commander's chair in the back. The chair was positioned to see most of the consoles and the Oculus easily. On the port and starboard of the conn were the Damage control console and the communication console respectively.

Behind each Console sat one or several members of her crew. They were the most senior on board, and well-equipped to handle nearly any circumstance the ship could throw at them. She knew them all by name, but in this room, names were secondary. The position of the person sitting in the chair was primary.

As Angela walked up the stairs on the starboard side of the room, she nodded to the officers she saw. Most of them were focused on their panels, but a few gave respectful nods. The Navigator walked to the sensor panel and sat down behind the operator. Angela reached the third tier and spotted her Executive officer, Davon. He was a tall man, and incredibly broad. His hands were gigantic. Easily twice the size of hers. His mask hid a short beard and braided hair. He spoke with a thick, gruff voice that occasionally dipped into the growl territory. Angela knew him enough to see the smile in his eyes behind his mask.

“Aye Captain, nice of you to join us.” He said, touching his brow in the approximation of a salute.

“Davon, When I said you could run drills anytime you wanted, I didn’t mean while I was asleep,” Angela said gruffly, walking over to his chair and crossing her arms.

Davon waved one massive, gloved hand. “Bah, anytime is a good time for drills.”

Angela smiled under her mask. “Just tell me next time”

“Aye, captain.” Davon stood from the chair and stretched, his head nearly touching the ceiling of the room, despite it being two and a quarter meters tall.

Angela walked up to the chair and sat down in it. She glanced over the different panels that showed her the condition of her ship.

Angela turned to her XO and saluted. “I relieve you. I have the Conn”

Davon saluted back, correctly this time, “Aye Captain. I stand relieved. You have the Conn.” He turned and walked down the steps. He was heading to the Secondary bastion, where he would take command if the Prime bastion was ever compromised for any reason.

“Comms, the captain has the Conn.” Angela called over her shoulder. The Communication nodded and grabbed a thick well-worn book from its holder. He opened it to a page and began carefully writing inside.

“Carry on,” Angela said.

The Controllers responded with a chorus of “Carry on aye” The room quickly filled with low-level murmurs as the officers under her command resumed talking quietly into their headsets.

 Angela turned toward the damage control board mounted on the forward bulkhead, directly above the Oculus. The panel displayed a drawn-out representation of her entire ship. Each of the many compartments on the ship was represented here. There were lights at the center of each compartment that indicated its status as well as a pressure gauge beside the light. Most of the lights were green, which meant that nothing was abnormal. One light, located in one of their chiller rooms, was white. It was a sight that sent an involuntary shudder through Angela. Even though it was a drill, the idea of mist getting into her ship was uncomfortable to say the least.

“Damage control, report status of the casualty,” Angela said, her voice falling into the tenor of command easily.

“Aye Ma’m. The Incursion has stopped. The emitters are on service, no signal leakage reported. There were no casualties. There was no damage to equipment. The incursion was from the port radiator hull valve. A repair plan is being conducted”

Angela nodded, approving. “How long until the compartment is safe?”

“Approximately 8 minutes.”

“Very well.” Angela said.

“Do I have an unlimited bell?” She directed this last question to the Pilot, situated directly in front and below her. The pilot himself was seemingly lounging, his hands lazily resting on his controls.

“The engine rooms are ready to answer all bells.” The Pilot said.

Angela considered performing a few rapid maneuver drills but decided against it. They were hunting, if they went to flank, there was a good chance that they would be seen by someone.

“Conn, Red contact! Bearing 300 Mark 23, range 52 miles! Designate Romeo Alfa!” The Sensor console belted out.

Angela turned to the Oculus. In the old days, navigation had been a lot harder. Representing a three-dimensional battlefield on a two-dimensional map was very difficult. The Oculus solved this problem using a glass sphere filled with transparent lights. When a ship was detected, the signal would automatically go to the calculators in the forward part of the bastion.  Eron’s machines would do whatever black magic they did, and a light would flicker into existence inside her Oculus. This light showed the approximate position of the contact relative to the Phoenix.  It allowed Angela to keep track of all the ships around the *Phoenix* and their relative positions and bearings with a glance, instead of wasting time trying to decipher maps.

The Oculus previously only contained a blue dot at the center that represented the *Phoenix*. It now showed a faint red cloud at the very edge of the sphere, slightly to the starboard side and up of where the *Phoenix* was pointing. Not quite blocking their path, but close.

The ship was leaking heat from somewhere. That’s how they had found it so far out. Angela scoffed. The idiots were trying to be stealthy with a leaky ship this deep into the mist.

“Sensors, Get the scope on it”

“Already done cap’n” The sensors console said. The man was intensely focused on his screens, and adjusting dials rapidly.

“Can they see us?” Angela asked, watching the contact closely.

The sensor officer shook his head. “Not a chance, Not unless they got a high-powered scope on that bucket and knew exactly where we are” He never took his eyes off of his panel.

“Pilot, All stop.” Angela said. “Secure from the drill. Weapons, Prepare a targeting solution on all targets.”

“Aye” The officers responded. The pilot brought the throttle lever to stop, and the quiet humming of the engines slowly wound down. On the Damage control board, the white light flickered back to green.

They couldn’t physically see the other ship from this distance. Not while this deep in the Mist. It was only in the upper layer of the mist that sight became a factor in ship-to-ship engagement. Most civilian ships preferred to stay up there, where they could see a pirate raid coming. But It was cheaper to fly deeper, where the lift lattices didn’t require as much heat. And if the civilian ships couldn’t see the pirates, the pirates usually couldn’t see the civilian ships either. Usually. The *Phoenix* was far from the nearest major shipping lane, so Angela had even odds on this contact being a pirate, cargo ship, or patrol vessel.

The seconds passed slowly. As it grew closer, the previously indistinct cloud grew more defined. It was clearly a ship, though it was moving slowly.

“Conn, Weapons reports they have a firing solution.”

Angela turned to the weapon’s console.

“Time?” She asked.

The weapons officer grinned “1 minute, thirty seconds.”

Angela nodded her head approvingly. Eron’s Machines and her crew’s sheer skill made an impressive combination.

“Conn, red contact! Bearing 300 Mark 23, range 45 Kilometers! Designate Romeo Bravo.”

The new contact was slightly behind and below Romeo Alfa, but moving at the same speed. It was probably the merchant that the leaky warship was trying to protect.

“Scope, do we have a designation on Romeo Alfa yet?”

The sensor officer shook his head. “Not yet Ma’m, it's still too far.”

“XO, what do you think?” Angela said to the empty air.

Out of the speakers mounted to the railing of the ring, the XO's gruff voice responded.

“Looks like a merchant and its escort, though why they would be this far down is a mystery to me”

Angela nodded. Merchants were built to use their heavy weight to go incredibly quickly, far quicker than any pirate ship could hope to match. For a merchant to be this far down, and moving this slowly, either something was broken, or the merchant was trying to hide illicit activities. Either way, the *Phoenix* would respond. The nature of the response would depend on a variety of factors.

“XO, how about we see if we can render assistance?”

Angela could hear the grin.

“I think that’s a great idea, Captain.”

Angela grinned herself and strapped into her chair. She manipulated controls on her chair, and the Oculus rotated around so she could better see the tactical picture.

“Pilot, All Ahead one third, come right 5 degrees rudder, steady course 047. Quartermaster, sound general quarters. Navigation, calculate a reciprocal course ending five kilometers behind Romeo Bravo. Weapons, load a firing solution on both targets. Keep it constantly updated as we change position. Damage control, set condition one throughout the ship upon muster confirmation.”

The ship’s alarm bell began to ring. All over the ship, sailors rushed to their battle stations. Masks, which had just been put away, were taken out and re-donned. After receiving confirmation that all compartments had breathing protection on, the DC officer turned a red dial to the left. Vents all over the ship opened and air rushed into them. Angela’s ears popped as the ship was rapidly depressurized. On the DC board, the air pressure gauges lowered steadily as all the air was pumped out.

The ship tilted up and steadily began increasing speed. Their hull was cold and when metal got cold, it got brittle. If they actually got into a fight, they would be at a heavy disadvantage. But if the *Phoenix* heated up, it would reveal their location. Better to get behind the target first.

Slowly, the ballet played out. The two ships ambled along, none the wiser that a predator had begun the hunt.

When gages at the DC board reached the lower red markings, the damage control officer turned the red dial back to the right and turned a black dial to the left. Nitrogen rushed into the ship, filling the void that oxygen had filled only moments before. The ship was pressurized above normal atmospheric pressure, and once the dials on the DC board had all reached the upper red marks, the DC officer stopped the flow of nitrogen.

As they drew closer, the dots on the Oculus grew to resemble the outline of a ship instead of an indistinct blob. Romeo Alfa was the classic flattened prism warship design. The very top and bottom of it were flat, while the sides slanted to form a sharp point. The front and back also slanted down to form a singular point on the bow. Viewed from above or the side, the ship would resemble a short rectangle that narrowed to long points on either end. Angela could also make out several railgun turrets festooned to its hull on the flat portions of the deck. The ship was leaking heat from various spots. Mostly from the propeller seals. Romeo Bravo was the standard merchant design, teardrop shaped, with massive engine pods on the back that were capable of moving the ship at speeds that the *Phoenix* probably couldn’t match.

The ships were trying to be stealthy, but they were doing a terrible job at it. They simply weren’t designed to be this deep in the mist. While their hulls were cold, they still radiated a small amount of heat into the mist, undoubtedly created by their engines and other support systems. Mist naturally concentrated near any heat source, and as mist concentrated, it gave off a signal that could be detected by the aptly named Signal Lattice. The greater the temperature, the greater the signal, and the greater the distance at which the ship could be detected. The two ships were essentially trying to sneak through a darkened alleyway, entirely forgetting they were wearing fluorescent vests with blinking neon signs attached.

The *Phoenix* didn’t have that problem. Her hull was actively cooled just at mist temperature. While this was exquisitely expensive, it provided the incredible benefit of rendering the Phoenix virtually undetectable to their Signal Lattices. A black wolf in a darkened night, invisible to all but the keenest of senses. And Angela had just found her some rather blind sheep.

“Conn, I have a designation on Enemy contacts.” The Sensors officer said.

Angela nodded appreciatively. “Report”

“Aye Captain. Romeo Alfa is a modified Eagle class corvette; Modifications include an extra railgun turret and two class Bravo missile pods. The railgun turrets are the standard fifty millimeter, the missiles are class Alpha. Romeo Bravo is a standard Cortez class merchant. No weaponry.”

The Eagle class was an old, but survivable design. They could be found everywhere, from island police patrols to pirate enclaves. Angela rated its chances against the *Phoenix* as slightly better than a fly’s chance against a flyswatter.

While they were talking, the sensors officer suddenly leaned forward and rapidly began to adjust dials with his hand to the headphones on his ear. After a moment, he cocked his head and leaned back.

“Captain- Uh. Conn, Reporting a gain and loss of a contact. Bearing 340 mark 1 range 6 kilometers. I put my scope right on the location, but I was unable to identify what it was. Possible spurious signal.”

Angela furrowed her brow. This close, the Scope would have been able to see a gnat in flight. It was most likely an anomaly or something that the merchant did to stir up the mist.

“Keep an eye on it, Report anything unusual.”

“Aye Aye.”

“Weapons, Standby all mounts and tubes. Give me a lock with the spinal on Romeo Alfa.” Angela ordered.

As the crew began working, the Sensor officer said “Conn, I have a reading on their lift Lattices. Romeo Alfa reads one twenty with 4 Lattices while Romeo Bravo reads one eighty with 6.”

Angela’s eyebrows rose.

With that small a number of Lift Lattices and a reading of that large, both ships were dangerously close to the Shatter point. If they went any deeper there was a good chance that they would have a Surge and break one of the Lattices. And unless they dumped ballast, the ship would go down. It looked like this particular convoy was willing to take the risk of running heavy close to the lower layer in order to hide.

The *Phoenix* took up station about 5 kilometers behind Romeo Alfa. They were directly behind it, and neither of the targets still showed any sign that they had detected the *Phoenix*.

“Conn, I have a lock with the spinal. Missiles are loaded.” The weapons officer reported.

Angela nodded. She turned to her communication officer. “Comms, broadcast the following. Attention Eagle class Corvette and Cortez class merchant, This is the Privateer LTS *Phoenix.* Identify yourselves and state your flag. We have you locked in. Do not attempt to mauver rapidly or you will be fired upon. End message.”

Davon chuckled from the Secondary bastion. “A little antagonistic there Captain”

Angela scoffed. “Well someone woke me up without my coffee today, so I have the right to be a little antagonistic.”

She thought for a moment and then internally shrugged.  “Weapons, charge all railguns. Heat the hull and charge the armor. Raise all shields, set to low ripple. Might as well show we mean business.”

The weapons officer seemed happy finally getting to do something. “Aye Captain!”

The shields would take several minutes to come up to full strength, as would the armor. But once they were, the *Phoenix* would be very hard to kill.

The two ships didn’t change their heading at all, merely kept moving slowly forward. About a minute after their message, the ships replied. The comms officer read out the message, “LMS *Phoenix,* This is the merchant ship *Varinski*, and its escorting corvette *Arenana.* We hail from Centauri, and are heading back after a successful trading mission in Solar. Transmitting transponder code to Centauri Tower now. Please do not shoot.”

Angela frowned. The name *Varinski* stirred something somewhere deep in her mind. But she couldn’t quite put her finger on it.

“Davon, does *Varinski* ring any bells?” She said into her helmet mic.

“Aye, it does, but I canna put my finger on what bell exactly. Give me a second.” There was a rustling of paper as he started leafing through a book.

“Conn, I have confirmation from Centauri, the code checks out.” The comms officer said.

Angela’s frown deepened. Something about this whole scenario seemed off. The merchant trying to be stealthy, the leaky corvette, the lack of reaction at their proclamation. Something was screaming at her, but for the life of her couldn’t quite figure it out.

“Pilot, all stop. Sensors, give me a general sweep of the area, and prepare for an active pulse. Weapons, standby to fire.”

Both officers nodded. The quiet humming of the engines slowly wound down, and the ship became oddly quiet. The only sound was the clicking of gears from the calculators and the background whirring of fans.

Davon exclaimed suddenly. “There it is! It was in the papers from a week ago. The Cortez class cargo ship Varinski failed to show up to port on time. It says here that they’ve been trying to raise them on comms for days now. It's odd though. The papers donna mention anything about an escort.” Angela could almost hear the raised eyebrows. “The owners have put a bounty out on her, but it's incredibly small. Barely ten thousand drams. Ships easily worth a hundred times that.”

Angela blanched. “Why would they-”

The Spurious signal.

They didn’t care about the *Phoenix* because-

Angela shot upright in her chair, the belts holding her in place.

“Sensors! Active pulse! NOW!”

The sensors officer hit the red button instantly, without hesitating. The Phoenix’s deep horn blasted out a single note at incredible volume. The Oculus went red as the sound wave propagated outward. Angela watched the wave closely, waiting for-

“Red Contact! Bearing 090 mark 0 Range 4 kilometers! Designate Romeo Charlie!”

Angela’s stomach dropped through the floor. Fat merchant, leaky escort, a third ship, hiding in the mist. The perfect trap.

“It's charging railguns and raising shields!”

“EMERGENCY DROP! All ahead flank! Right Full rudder!” Angela roared.

The *Phoenix* dropped from the sky as the lift officer put his fist on the red button in the middle of his panel. Angela’s stomach went into her throat and her body pressed against the straps holding her down. Somewhere, something clattered as it fell out of a holding rack. The Pilot furiously manipulated his controls, and the ship began to ponderously turn. Romeo Charlie fired its railguns. The three slugs traveled incredibly fast, and were visible on the Oculus as streaks of red arrowing toward their ship, looking to tear out its insides.

But the Phoenix had dropped in time. Two of the slugs flew past the ventral deck of her ship with barely three meters of clearance, but the last one glanced off the sloped composite armor there with a shower of molten sparks and the screech of tortured metal. The entire ship shook with the impact, ringing like a giant gong. The slug spun off into the mist, trailing heat.

“Impact!” Damage control said, clearly relieved. “No hull breaches! All systems remain at full capacity!”

Nothing was broken, nothing was shattered. Angela allowed herself to breathe.

Angela looked at the forward status board. Shields were still coming up, at least another minute until they reached full effectiveness.

“Pilot, Nose on Charlie! All up neutral!”

The pilot hauled on the control stick and the ship began to tilt upwards.

“Firing again!”

This time, the railgun shots were much better aimed. The first round missed only slightly, the second and third rounds both impacted the shields. The rounds broke apart, spreading their deadly energy in a cone of shrapnel that clattered on the hull like so much steel rain. Though weakened, the shields were performing as designed, taking the majority of the kinetic energy out of the slug and breaking it into fragments where it could impact the hull as a weakened cone rather than a single solid projectile. It was very nearly enough. The entire ship shook as the slug penetrated into the inner armor.

“Multiple impacts! Hull breach at Frame 110 deck two! Performing damage assessment!”

“Steam rupture in the Number two engine room!”

“Two alpha turbine tripped! Lift array two is cross-connected bravo supplying!”

“Breach is sealed, No mist incursion detected.”

The reports came in. Angela’s eyes flicked to the DC board. Several of the lights had turned red, and the pressure across the ship was falling. No white lights yet. She eyed her targeting panel. Almost there.

“Nose on Romeo Charlie” The Pilot reported calmly.

“Fire the Spinal” Angela said, a note of finality in her voice.

The weapons officer twitched his finger, which had been lying on the trigger for their massive meter-bore spinal mount railgun for the entire engagement. The entire ship jolted backward. The sound of a lightning strike heard from a few meters away came from directly below her as the gigantic weapon accelerated a four-ton tungsten slug from a resting state to Mach sixteen in an incredibly short amount of time.

A tiny hole in the frontal shields opened and the round shot out, much faster than the enemy slugs. Romeo two was directly facing them now, and warming up its railguns for another volley. The two-meter-long slug blew through the enemy’s shields and impacted the ship directly on the nose.

A ship’s armor was designed to take the impact of a railgun round and spread it out, lessening the penetration. The armor of the enemy ship was too cold, and the slug too powerful, for the armor to accomplish this task correctly. Instead, the entire outer hull of the enemy ship reached its brittle fracture point and shattered like so many panes of glass. Thousands of metal shards were ejected out at terrifying velocities. What was left of the ship was hollowed out by the railgun round, still traveling well over ten times the speed of sound. The ship still had oxygen inside it, and the compression wave blew apart compartments and started fires. The twisted wreck fell out of the sky like a stone, barely recognizable as a ship that had once held humans safely in its hull. One of its lift arrays, liberated from the ship from the incredible energies at play, shot up into the mist as it exhausted the remainder of its heat energy. When it reached its apex, the Lift Lattice inside shattered. The entire array exploded with the force of a tremendous bomb, sending fragments clattering against the Phoenix’s hull. The shattered pieces of the array joined what had been a ship falling into the dark.

“Shields High Ripple! All mounts, Hold fire!” Angela said, scanning the Oculus for the other two ships. The merchant ship was running. All eight of its massive engines were heated up and pushing the ship along slowly. It would take a while for it to get up to speed. The Eagle class had fully turned around now and was bearing down on them at an angle, aiming to gain the high ground. All three of its railgun turrets were aimed and charging. Its shields were fully up, though they were also set to ripple. What was a fly had become the flyswatter.

Or at least, that was what they were thinking. Its railguns fired, a measly four-shot volley that streaked across the distance in a second. The rounds impacted the Phoenix’s full power shields and were turned to shrapnel. Angela barely felt the shudder as they impacted the hull.

“Impact! No damage!”

Angela nodded once. The shields would hold now.

“Pilot, Full mount firing angle ten starboard. Target is Romeo Alfa. Execute.”

The pilot pushed the rudder pedals with his feet, and the ship slowly swung to the side. All five of the *Phoenix’s* 250mm railgun turrets were unmasked and ready to fire.

“Weapons, All mounts, continuous fire on my mark, target is Romeo Alfa”

“Aye, captain!” The weapons officer said, his hands flying over the controls.

Angela felt the ship shudder as another five-round volley impacted. Ten-second reloads. An eternity in combat.

“Connn registering impact! No damage!”

It was Angela’s turn now.

“Weapons, All mounts! Commence continuous fire!”

The Weapons officer spoke into his mic, and the *Phoenix* began to shudder. The lights dimmed as the incredible energy requirement of the railguns began to eat into the ship’s electrical grid.

The railguns began firing. One mount after another, letting only a second pass between each successive mount firing. It wasn’t the most accurate of fire patterns, but it was not designed to be accurate. It was designed to put as much metal downrange as quickly as possible in order to disorientate and distract the enemy.

The Eagle’s shields were taking the brunt of the impacts, leaving the shrapnel of the shells to impact the armor and leave gouges and small craters. The shields would take a while to fail under such a barrage. Angela decided to end the fight quickly, just in case there were any more hidden ships around.

 “Sensors, do you have their Lift Lattices?” Angela asked, curling her hands around the arms of her chair.

“Aye Captain, Two Two Seven Five fand holding steady.”

“Weapons, Lock on and fire two missiles.”

“Aye! Ready on your mark captain!”

Angela’s eyebrows raised a hair, the crew had already anticipated her next order before it had even come out of her mouth. Having a competent and motivated crew was well worth the cost of their incredible pay.

“Execute!”

The ship shuddered as the two missiles shot out of the forward missile tubes with a blast of compressed air. These weapons were designed to use an enemy’s lift signature to track toward a target, and destroy it. The Phoenix’s forward shields flickered slightly and the missiles passed through only slightly slowed down. Once through the shields, the missile’s hydrazine engines kicked on, propelling the weapons forward at a breakneck pace.

Because the missile was much slower than a railgun shell, it would actually pass through the shields while they were set to Ripple. If the enemy wanted to, they could set their shields to Full. This would block the passage of the missile, but leave them vulnerable to railguns impacting the shield with full force. Instead of letting the slug through and reducing its speed and breaking it apart, the railgun round would be stopped entirely by the shield. This would quickly overwhelm the hydraulic shock absorbers of the enemy ship. It might even break the enemy’s Shield Lattice permanently. Of course, they could try to maneuver around the missiles, but they had acquired their lift signal, and were both homing in on their ship with unerring accuracy.

Angela had effectively given the ship only a few terrible options. They chose poorly.

“Romeo Alfa’s Lift signal is at zero!” the Sensor’s officer called out.

The pair of missiles swapped to heat tracking, but they weren’t able to reacquire the signal. Both weapons spiraled off into the mist.

“Cease fire! Pilot, Follow them down, All up one quarter.”

The *Phoenix* fell slower than the pirate. They had turned back on their Lift Lattices, but they were so heavy, and the Lattices were already at their capacity. Angela calmly watched their fall rate slow, waiting for the inevitable.

There.

Angela saw it in the Oculus. A great tendril of compressed mist spiked from the Dark, hitting the forward port corner of the enemy ship. Instantly, it began to tilt to one side as the Lift Lattice there was shattered. Angela saw a massive heat bloom come out the bottom of the pirate ship.

“Captain, they are dropping their ballast. Their shields are down.” The sensors officer said quietly.

Watching a ship spiral after a Surge was something that inspired empathy in most sailors, even if that ship was an enemy.

Surprisingly, the pirate ship recovered. It leveled out about 4 kilometers above the dark. Its propellers were still spinning, but very slowly now.  Now that the ship had no ballast, it moved much slower, and couldn’t support its shield's electrical power requirement anymore. The ship slowly drifted up, tilting forward and to the port side heavily. Angela nodded. The ship’s crew had done well in the recovery. Not everyone could recover from a spiral like that. Her thoughts then turned to the merchant. With its escort out of the scenario, it would be easy prey, all she had to do was-

“Enemy lift signal is at zero!”

The Eagle class ship fell. Angela watched, open-mouthed, as it hit the surface of the dark. It impacted the liquid, the several hundred-ton ship not even causing a splash. The ship was quickly devoured, the hungry liquid creeping over the surface of the ship with a supernatural speed. Soon, nothing remained of the ship. The only signs that it had even existed at all were memories and paper logs. None of which would tell the story of this ship, none of which would tell the stories of the people who had lived onboard.

Angela cleared her throat. In the dead silence of the bastion, the noise sounded like a gunshot.

“Pilot, make for the merchant, all ahead full.  Quartermaster, set condition two throughout the ship, and secure the ship from general quarters. Comms, make a note in the ship’s log and forward it to Landing and the Company. Sighted two pirate vessels, sunk same. In pursuit of a third.”

The officers murmured their acceptance. The bastion remained quiet. Angela sat back down in her chair. The Eagle could have survived, should have survived. She had no idea why the crew would work so hard at recovering the ship only to leave it for the Dark. It made no sense. She shook her head. That was a problem for later. For now, she had a ship to catch.

I got a nespresso original line as I love getting iced lattes only from coffee shops and wanted to have an affordable option for every day drinks. I don’t expect it to be identical to the coffee shop of course as they use a legit setup, but my lattes just are not measuring up at all 🥲 

I warm up the machine, brew two shots of freddo intenso, use 5 oz of whole milk (same I order), add 3 pumps of the same syrup brand (Monin) as my favorite coffee shops, and add ice after to avoid melting. I’m finding I don’t taste the coffee flavor much despite using two shots, it is not very much latte, and I swear I don’t feel it wakes me up as much haha. 

I’ve adjusted my ratios and less makes my latte too small, but more dilutes the flavor more. I tried putting the shots in the fridge overnight but saw no difference. I see everyone suggest freddo intenso as strong, is there a better option someone could suggest? Biggest thanks 😻😻",3,1730768711.0,nespresso,19,1.0,False

I'm curious to the people who are sensitive to and have chronic migraines/headaches throughout their lives how Vyvanse/Stimulants have been with them.  
I've had headaches since I was 12/13 years old and am now mid 30s. I've gone to head specialists and have had my head scanned and according to them ""im fine"". Around my late 20s I got diagnosed with ADHD and I tried Adderall 15mg XR via my Dr. about 5 years ago but never fully committed to it because when it wears off the migraines that come along with it. I never stuck with it because I try to avoid things that induce more headaches than I already get the best I can. As I'm getting older I've also noticed that sometimes even coffee can trigger a headache for me (if high in caffeine) so I stick with lower dosages of caffeine with light teas or matcha's. I've always consumed caffeine throughout my life and never seemed to have a problem with it until literally sometime earlier this year.  
  
I'm trying stimulants again for my ADHD and have read and heard that different brands/generics that can cause headaches for some people while others don't. I was recently prescribed Vyvanse 30mg with my Psych after telling her my issues in the past with Adderall and why I never stuck with it.   
I'm 3 days in and have had a non-stop migraine on top of the no appetite. I've read through here where people have said to give it a week or two for your body to adjust but I'm curious for the people who are sensitive to things and have chronic headaches/migraines, does this ever go away?   
I would hate to have to deal with this migraine for the next 2+ weeks just for them to possibly still be there. I've even read a post where someone said their headaches didn't go away for 6 months! Haha, I don't think I could last that long. It's also hard to tell whether the medication is actually helping me because all I can think about and focus on IS my head hurting.",1,1730768496.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

Something I like about TES is that USUALLY no one tries to hassle me about my beliefs    For example, going to a friend's MB church I often get""Are you saved?"" or ""Do you believe?""  questions which I want to answer with *None of your Business.*..or *Leave me alone*

That being said, conversations (what few there are) with other members often are, if not shallow ""Hows the weather?"" are more often left to non-philosophical subjects such as travel or arts

which I enjoy

On the few occasions that we have ventured into discussions about the aesthetical inspiration we find at the service  I am finding that there are many who like me are considered ""non-theists"" in that we do not believe in an entity deity but rather as God as a concept or a construct.  Kind of like what Bishop Spong said when he points out that humans cannot define god, to do so may be delusional. Except that   for me the human experience of *God* is to seek beauty,  practice Love and Peace.  I would be considered atheist by many definitions, as I do not believe in an entity Deity, or Agnostic in that humans could not possibly know God otherwise. 

That being said, the social experience I seek in TES does not require a vocal evangelization. I need only to find inspiration and I certainly find it in the Eucharist, in the message of our priests,  the music and the esoteric beauty of the high Mass. 



If that were to become a topic of discussion in person, so be it, but at this point I do not see why I would sit down after service at coffee and talk with anyone, much less sit down and say ""Oh BTW I believe this and this...""  No need for that  ",0,1730768235.0,Episcopalian,6,0.45,False

I recently relocated to NYC and am looking to sublease either a Studio or 1br apartment **or** a 1br with existing roommates. See below for additional information and feel free to comment or message me with any additional inquiries.

Boroughs:

* Manhattan - I'm open to rooms or apartments in any neighborhood that is south of Central Park. This includes both east and west sides. I'm open to apartments in Harlem as well.
* Brooklyn - I'm open to rooms or apartments that are easily accessible to Manhattan. I prefer either Dumbo, BK Heights, Williamsburg, Bushwick, or Fort Greene neighborhoods but am open to housing that is in close proximity to a MTA line and within 20mins to/from Hudson Square.

About Me:

* I'm an openly gay 29M young professional working in the advertising/creative industry. My family and friends would best describe me as lively/jovial, diplomatic, kindhearted, and personable. I enjoy harmony and cleanliness in my home space and would expect the same out of any roommate. I'm happy to grab coffee with interested roommates.

Rent:

* $1,500-$2,300
