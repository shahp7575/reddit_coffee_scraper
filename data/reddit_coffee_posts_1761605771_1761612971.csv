1ohvzbv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ohvzbv,My first class experience,"

I work on a remote mine site, so I am on a plane every week to and from work. Naturally with this comes racking up a decent amount of FF points. 

I booked Singapore - Dubai , Dubai to Munch First Class for 1,157 AUD + 125,000 Qantas Frequent flyer points around a year in advance (August 2023, Travelled July 2024)

The lounge in Singapore is shared with the business lounge, I tried to see if I could get in to the Qantas First Lounge lounge however it was unfortunately closed as there was no Qantas flights taking off in that time period. In any case, the lounge was decent with a variety of food and very attentive staff.

I boarded the Singapore- Dubai leg and was instantly offered traditional Arabic coffee along with Dom. I opted for both (because holidays, why not). Once we were at cruising altitude I was offered another glass of Dom along with some warm nuts. Of course I had to have the caviar - which was my first time trying it. I also opted for the Arabic Mezze and Prawn Machbous . All were excellent. The flight time was around 7 hours, given I was travelling from Singapore to Europe I was trying to adjust to the time zone so opted for a coffee before touchdown in Dubai which was served along with some biscotti.

I was first off the plane and was immediately met by an Emirates representative who escorted me to the First Class Lounge. Unfortunately the lounge was undergoing some repairs so there was a bit of noise going on - I was quite full from all the food on the first flight so opted for an Iced Latte along with a pasty.

I boarded the Dubai - Munich leg and to my surprise I was the only one in first class. Like the first flight, I was instantly offered some Dom along with coffee to keep me awake until I got to Munich. I had to get the caviar again, I opted for a salad for my main along with Chocolate Cake for dessert. The crew were lovely- asking what my travel plans were and what I planned to do in Munich. I mentioned I was keen to check out good coffee shops along with small bars and museums. Around 20 mins after that conversation, one of the flight attendants came back with a list of around 20 odd places to try from one of the other flight attendants that lived in Munich. Great service!

The onboard shower was also a really cool experience and a bit of pinch me moment.

I really can’t fault the service on both flights, just exceptional. So pleased to have been able to tick a bucket list item off the list.

Lately I've been exploring understated combos - soft greys, denim blues, forest greens - looking for that calm space between relaxed and refined. These three ""Comfy intellectual"" (Sunday off, coffee, reflection) looks stirred a mix of reactions elsewhere, especially the grey-on-grey one.

Curious how this reads to you: does the tonal layering come off as intentional and cohesive, or just too muted?

I'm experimenting with how simplicity, texture, and small contrasts (like burgundy socks or a tan watch strap) can still feel expressive.

1ohvyya,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1ohvyya/there_are_bugs_everywhere_part_five_the_end/,"There are bugs everywhere. part five, the end.","Some days I'm hungrier than most. Even if I went to the fridge or pantry everything would be rotten, past its best before date. When I feel the need to get up, I go into the kitchen and hope for the best. I remind myself of the feeling of those ants digging itself into my open wounds. The sharp stingy pain it is and I just lie back down and sleep, praying that I wake up from this nightmare, but every time I do I can hear them crawling around. My room, a nest of spiders and silverfish, if the spiders are kind enough to let them live. 

I can feel it. I myself am just a fly caught in a web.  Every time I move or try to escape they tighten their hold against me. I'm stuck only to struggle, if I have the energy to.  I know that once I give up I'll be eaten alive. 

I feel like giving up. I'm so close to it. If I can't leave and am forced to play this waiting game, I might as well just give them what they want. I'm in my own mind all day replaying over and over again what got me into this situation. And I can only blame myself. If I didn't ignore the first problem, if I just left then, I wouldn't be here. I procrastinated solving my own problem and now can only blame myself that I've become food to creatures smaller than me. 

Everyday I hear the deafening noise of the cicadas outside.  Lying on my couch, my arm blocking the hot sun from my eyes going over the same ‘what ifs’ trying to come up with some semblance of a happy ending even with all the wrong choices made, I can't, in every run through I think of, I'm trapped. I'm alone left for dead. 

I'm alone, yet even now hundreds upon hundreds of eyes are on me, watching my every move waiting to pounce. They're getting restless. I can see them. The waves of ants, closer than ever. My books turned to dust, food for the predators that are waiting to eat me alive. Spiders in the bathroom turn to me when I open the door daring me to even try stepping into their new home. And my room is just a web, a bed for them to sleep undisturbed and I do not even care to step close to their door.  

The cicadas are ringing in my ears, sharp and blaring over and over again, no pause for me to breathe, it gets louder and louder. It hurts. My ears. My head. It all hurts. I cover my ears, my eyes closing trying to stop the lights and screeching noise from assaulting me but it doesn't. I can hear it in my head screaming at me. 

I sit up moving away from the sun into the shade of the living room. Standing now, in the middle of my room, my eyes widen at the sight of the ants. My hands are still over my ears trying to stop the screeching noise. I step back, the ants moving closer to me. cornering me. Panic sets in a feeling I've gotten used to. The waves of them are getting closer and I can see spiders in the corner multiplying as they come down. I take another step back tripping over the coffee table. 

Falling onto my back, my hands instinctively go back to catch my fall, uncovering my ears to the loud screeching. I scream out sitting up and crawling back to get away from the ants covering my ears again. I'm pushed against the wall still trying to move back and away. 

The ants are crawling up my legs, digging into my skin, the self-inflicted wounds, now holes, made for their new home trying to dig into and live under my skin. A sharp pain erupts every time they slam their little head inside the infected areas. 

The spiders drop down into my hair, immediately starting to make its new home, biting into my scalp like lice, making its webs in my hair combining the two. My hands move up, panicked, trying to get them off, push them out and off of me. 

But they hold on tickling my head crawling onto my face. I scream out, flicking it off. I curl up trying to hide my face from them as I kick and scream my hands moving from my ears to my head. Buzzing noises come down mixing in with the screeches of the cicadas. I glance up seeing large flies. The biggest ones I've ever seen. Flying down going into my hair to be eaten by the spiders trying to move closer to me. My hands continue to move back and forth from my scalp to cover my ears. 

I scream out in pain again, the ants unrelenting, the spiders eating my head. The flies buzzing in my ears as the cicadas scream out in my head. I cry out, tears coming out from exhaustion and pain taking over my body. I want to give up but I struggle against the pain. My eyes tightly shut, not wanting to see anymore of this, as my hands are still moving from my hair to my ears. 

A loud buzzing penetrated my ears. I cover them up, but I still hear it inside moving deeper. Buzzing loudly I feel every attempt of flight, and every move of them going inside squeezing itself into the tight hole of my ears finding its way to buzz into my eardrum adding to the deafening ringing of the cicadas. A sharp loud pain can be felt with each buzz of the flies in my ears. 

I can feel something crawling up my legs, something bigger than the ants. I look to see large silver fish. Multiple silverfish coming from out of my room, under the door. I scream trying to get them off but there's only more to replace the ones that fall off. They continue to crawl up my legs, arms, and torso. My body, a playground of bugs, no longer my own. 

I can feel all the different types of bugs crawling, tickling me. Six, eight, hundreds, thousands of legs on top of me. Moving about, now reaching my face, I stay curled up with my hands over my ears, my eyes shut. I keep my eyes closed tightly, but I can feel it forced open by something big crawling inside. A sharp deep pain comes from the bug going deeper into my eyes, nestling itself behind my eye. More and more go in. One after the other I cry and scream out. Sobs breaking out with each and every push of them trying to take over my body. And I can feel the sharp needle-like legs of the spiders going into my mouth and down my throat with every scream turning into chokes and swallows. They're going down my throat, esophagus, and stopping where it wants to be, crawling up and down leaving its trails of scratches and bites. 

I can feel it now, the ants in my skin making the tunnels of their new home. The spiders in my hair, down my windpipe making its circular webs. The silverfish in my eyes, the flies buzzing in my ears, the ringing of the cicadas in my head echoing louder and louder. I scream out once more. My body curled up in a ball. Unconsciously, rocking back and forth, my hands cover my ears and in my hair. I'm finally silent. Quiet sobs come out of me. Twitching in pain, more often than not. I am cold. Dirt and grime cover me in a moist layer, a second skin.

I pass out from pain and wake up from pain. I can feel them all moving around, but I don't fight it. I stay on my floor letting myself be used.

They've won. Eaten me alive. Had me be nutrients for their children. Take every ounce of me, use me as they're home. Nothing to be wasted as nature would've wanted. Already dead, but kept alive by them, for them. ",1,1761612843.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

1ohvxmo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ohvxmo,"DC --> Pittsburgh in 3 days, 23-25 October 2025","**This was somewhat of a revenge tour...** 

Last year I was riding from Pittsburgh --> DC with a group of 8 friends and crashed on my way down the hill into Cumberland - I crossed the railroad tracks at too shallow of an angle and the bike washed out from under me. I ended up with a separated shoulder (no breaks or tears!) and some nasty road rash. I also ended up with a grudge. 

I immediately started plotting how I wanted to do the whole thing, but in a different way. Last year we planned a ""leisurely pace"" over 6 days. I knew I had the legs to do it faster than that and started recruiting friends crazy enough to do it with me.

**Day 1 - C&O Mile 0 to Hancock, MD**

I live in the DC area and regularly ride and train on the section between Lock 21 (Swains Lock) or Lock 24 (Rileys Lock) out to Shepherdstown, so I knew what to expect here. 

We departed our friend's hotel and headed to Mile 0. There were lots of folks out doing their morning ride or run or row. I put our official start at 06:42 AM (we knew we needed to go early to put in miles). We all had good gear but it was still cold that early by the river. We weaved our way out of the city and into MD, stopping more than we probably should, to take pictures and try to warm cold hands and feet. As the sun rose, spirits were high and we pushed onto White's Ferry for a great (but slow) breakfast sandwich. This became somewhat of a theme.

We made steady progress west, but headwinds and clouds were keeping us down a bit. I can't remember any big issues on this part of the trail other than some broken surfaces, sticks, and slight detours.

Our next big stop was Shepherdstown for late lunch and we rode into town ending up at the Blue Moon Cafe, after a suggestion from some locals. It is right on the edge of the university and the food and atmosphere was great. Unfortunately, again, it takes a long time to eat at a restaurant in town from the C&O, so we burned a lot of time here.

Back on the trail, we realized it was inevitable we would be riding quite a few miles at night. 

I had never seen this part of the trail and the Big Slackwater was definitely a highlight. I do love rocks and water, but not necessarily riding that close to the edge of either one. With that said, it was one of my favorite parts of the trip.

To prepare for dark, we stopped along the trail in Williamsport and loaded up on sugar, snacks, and trail-side instant coffee. The wind had died down with the sun and that felt promising, but we knew it was about to get cold. Thank goodness for that hot coffee! With good lights and gear, the trip from Williamsport to Hancock in the dark was actually a highlight for me, including an owl that swooped out of a tree above us and then stayed just above our lights. We also saw a billion deer and yelled ""go on git!"" at each and every one. The stairs detour was pretty sketchy at night and there were so many sticks lurking under the leaves on the trail. I think we also ran into a downed tree here. Regardless, we made good steady progress and no one had a mechanical.

We arrived in Hancock spent, hungry, and tired. All we had the energy for was to grab food from Sheetz on the way to the Super 8. Both were just what we needed.

127.68 mi, 13.0 mph avg (moving), 9:48:48 (moving), 14:22:20 (elapsed, to hotel)

**Day 2 - Hancock, MD to Meyersdale, PA**

This was planned as a shorter day due to the climb out of Cumberland, so we gave ourselves the luxury of starting a bit later. We rolled at 7:57 AM from the hotel to Sheetz and then ate breakfast at the park across the street. I believe we started the trail closer to 9 AM.

Almost immediately we hit the detour at Polly Pond (MP 134.3) and had to switch to the WMRT. That was actually a really welcome detour for tired sit bones. If I do the trail again, I will use as much of the WMRT as possible. 

The trail continues as double track from here to Paw Paw, and it was in decent shape. The friends that rode it last year noted that the grass was much shorter now and there was almost no water or puddles. It was a bit of a slog, but that's what we signed up for! I was outpacing my riding partners here and rode much of this solo to Paw Paw, enjoying being away from everything. One or two riders passed in the opposite direction, but the trail was not busy. I stopped just before the trail turns toward the tunnel and waited, and then we had trail-side lunch from Sheetz in the morning, another coffee, and other snacks to get us through to Cumberland. 

The area around the Paw Paw tunnel was busy, so it was slow going picking through. It was fun to experience it, but the actual surface was a bit nasty. I was again glad I had a good light!

It seems like significant work was done to improve the surface of the trail from Paw Paw to Cumberland since last year, and that was very welcome. Our only real adventure here was a huge tree down. We worked together to pass bikes over branches and helped another older cyclist get his bike through safely as well. Unfortunately, one of my riding partners was starting to get saddle sores. We introduced him to chamois butter a bit too late to make a difference. 

Again, I pushed ahead a bit to Cumberland and we waited to regroup just at the end of the C&O. We had late lunch at European Desserts and More and the meat pie was one of the best things I've ever tasted. I'm sure being fresh off the trail helped that. Unfortunately here we said goodbye to one of our friends as his saddle sores got too bad to continue. He live in Pittsburgh so was able to bail in that direction. We did rendezvous with another friend who came from northern VA to pedal with us to Meyersdale. Having a new fresh member of the group was a nice boost for the upcoming climb. 

The climb... It's less steep than I remember (from descending it) but wow, it goes on forever. I had rationed my power all day for this and I put in what felt like a great effort to the top. I hit the Borden Tunnel and the temp dropped 10 degrees on the other side. I stopped just outside the Big Savage tunnel to regroup and I was there with perfect evening light. Inside the tunnel was FREEZING and we were happy to emerge. By the time we hit the Eastern Continental Divide, the sun was down and it was getting dark. Thankfully this was the end of our climbing and raced to Meyersdale, enjoying the negative grade and stillness of the night.

Overnight in Meyersdale was at Yoder's Guest House, which is very welcoming and comfortable. We had time for a quick shower and dinner out before crashing again for the night.

93.20 mi, 12.6 mph avg (moving), 7:13:12 (moving), 11:20:36 (elapsed, to hotel)

**Day 3 - Meyersdale, PA to Pittsburgh, PA**

We knew it would be cold. It was cold when we started. It was cold the first night. It was cold the second morning. It was really cold in the tunnel. It was cold (high 30s) leaving Meyersdale. If I could go back and add one piece of gear, it would be shoe covers. All I can say is I'll take the cold over the rain, especially cold rain (like we had last year). 

We had a great breakfast at Yoder's and headed up the hill at 8:13 AM. It was a struggle between keeping the power down and trying to stay warm! The chill in the air did make for some dramatic fog / mist scenes as we pedaled west, through the fields. It's one of those moments you're glad you woke up early to see.

We were pretty miserable, cold and sore, but at least we had the slow descent to aid us. We were making good time on the gravel superhighway that is the GAP (compared to the C&O) but had to stop and walk and move and try to warm up a few times. It was a different kind of suffering, and not one that I'm really used to. I had done a few centuries, but never 2 back to back and it had taken a toll on my body. My sit bones and shoulder blades were screaming in agony, but I knew we'd come too far and knew I could withstand it and finish the task.

From about mile 20 to mile 60 for the day, the trail descends a bit more and that really helped our momentum. First, we hit Confluence and the sun was finally above the trees and warmth was spreading. I was able to shed a layer. The trail is absolutely gorgeous as it follows the Youghiogheny, and I'm originally from Western PA, so this feels like home to me. I feel connected to that part of the world and geography in a spiritual way.

Lunch in Ohiopyle was another highlight - a burger and fries at the Falls Market Restaurant. We were able to sit on the patio and people watch while a curious cat checked out our bikes and laid down for a pet. This was a great stop as we were able to get in and out quicker than most places. There were also lots of people to chat with and everyone wanted to know where you came from and how far you were going. Most were surprised we were headed the whole way to Pittsburgh that day!

After that stop, it was time to lock in and put down miles. Next time I will spend more time on this section of the trail, but given our mission, we didn't really slow up again until Connellsville,. Connellsville was our first stop the year before, so it felt like a major achievement to make it that far. Again, lifting spirits...roughly halfway done!

You can call what came next a slog or a grind or any number of things. It was not pleasant, including a downed tree, but we were able to duck under that. Thankfully the weather was still good and we were able to power through. I wasn't really hungry when we pulled into West Newton but we stopped to eat anyway. This is one where it was tough to balance needing time off the bike, needing to eat something, and feeling like too much time is slipping away eating at a restaurant. We stopped at The Trailside for a perfectly good sports bar meal. 

At this point we had less than 35 miles to go. The temp was starting to drop but I didn't put any layers back on. This was the right call even if I started out cold. I quickly warmed up with the effort of pulling my partner to the finish.

I have to say I actually welcomed the hills and punchy climbs as we approached McKeesport. At least it was something different! Finally we were off the gravel and onto the road, and knew the finish was within reach. We rolled slow through McKeesport making sure we were navigating correctly and got stopped for a train for only a few moments. One last bottle of electrolytes and some sugar (Nerds gummy clusters and Haribo peaches) and we were ready for the final push!

I'm more of a road rider anyway, so I didn't mind the paths or the traffic (too much) as we got closer and closer to the city. We did almost get taken out by someone turning right into the Costco parking lot. That was the closest call of the trip!

Finally, the Hot Metal Bridge and the last stretch to The Point! The city was loud and busy compared to the past few days but I welcomed the energy. We arrived just before 7 PM, finishing what we set out to do. Our friend was waiting for us to grab a quick vid and pics and then shuttled us off for the evening.

1ohvxmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ohvxmh/i_hear_the_thudding_of_her_necklace_of_skulls/,I Hear The Thudding Of Her Necklace Of Skulls Every Night.,"I grew up in India, a land rife with superstitions and rituals. 

I grew up in India, and yet I never believed in the myths and tales. I was a skeptic. A young theatre kid who was the product of one of my country's many growing metropolises, who was raised by 2010's YouTube and a few very indulging art teachers. And I soon grew into a young woman who was Indian in a foreign land, a college student armed with nothing but a European Visa and a backpack, hustling to fit into a strange foreign land.

Like I said, I did not believe in rituals. I never attempted to believe in rituals. 

It is 2025. I'm a grown woman now. I live alone. 

I was swamped in deadlines and on the first day of my period. My genitalia was throbbing and sending jolts of pain up my spine. My uterus was contracting and convulsing in white hot pain. And it wasn't anything new - it happened every month, I was used to it. But I still missed my mother and my grandmother. 

It was perhaps due to a strange nostalgia for home that I found myself remembering my mother's stories. My mama had always been a devout woman. She had claimed to see spirits in her dreams when I was a child. I vividly remember a specific event from when I was eight. Mama hadn't been herself after my younger brother was born. I suppose a psychologist would have called it Post-Partum Depression, but 2000's India didn't really have psychologists or psychiatrists. Instead, they had mediums. One such medium was our cleaning lady. 

It had been a sunny weekend. I had just returned from school and I'd seen mama talk to the walls. I'd asked her what she was doing, and she had asked me if I'd seen a woman in a white saree sprint towards me, screaming. I'd declined even as my mother's protests got more frantic. And finally, the cleaning lady, Jaya Ma, had rushed to stand between mama and I with a hot saucepan full of salt and ash in her right hand. She had waved the saucepan in rhythmic motion around mama's head. And slowly, mama had returned to normal while Jaya Ma had screamed like a feral wolf as she ran to throw away the burning remains of the salt mixture.

They had told me to stay far away from that salt mixture until the garbagemen took it away. But it was the early 2000's and ghost movies were all the rage and I was a kid, and so I'd snuck out to see the clumps in the middle of the night.

They were shaped like a young woman in mid-scream. 

I saw her in my dreams for years until I started high school and decided that I was too cool to be scared of what could only have been a neurotic breakdown on mama's part. And sometime in high school I also chalked up the figure in the ashes to a trick of the eye. 

And suddenly I was back in my apartment in Belgium, wondering why I was thinking of what had to be a skewed childhood memory. I laughed it off. I went out to dinner and went to classes the next day.

It was evening the next day, I was sitting on my couch, the cramps that I had suffered through all day the previous day having dulled into a throbbing pain in my abdomen and a hell lot of fatigue. And just as I wondered if I should take another painkiller to be able to go out gorcery shopping without collapsing on the streets or something, I heard a rustling near my door. I froze.

*Meow.*

I sighed in relief. It was my kitten, Mia. ""You terrified me, baby!"" I cried as I beckoned her over and groaned as I saw that she had left claw marks on my wallpaper.

*Meow.*

She scratched at my jeans and looked at me with eyes so slitted they were almost unnerving. Now, I found this a bit weird. Mia had never been very vocal or aggressive or prone to getting scared, especially since I'd gotten her neutered recently. But I wasn't too worried. After all, she was a cat. Cats acted weird all the time. I still remembered the time she'd freaked out because of a dead dragonfly on the windowpane. 

""Do you want mama to give you a kiss?"" I said in the baby voice that I hoped no one except Mia ever heard for the sake of my reputation in the office. I scooped her up and pressed a kiss onto her tufty orange fur. She stopped meowing and I relaxed, so much that I barely noticed a breeze blowing past me as I spoke. 

*Probably just hungry again.* I thought to myself as I stood up to get some canned fish for Mia and a coffee and a painkiller for myself. 

I paid no mind when I heard her hiss behind me as I walked to the kitchen island. *It's probably a bird at the window again.* I told myself. Although this time I hoped that there wasn't anything actually wrong with my cat. Who knew with all the horror stories about randomly triggered rabies or FIV virus you heard on the internet?  

Looking back, I should have paid mind.

That night, I dreamed of *her* again. The woman I saw in that ratty saucepan in the dumpster. Her eyes were vacant and her scream guttural. And it was loud. Really LOUD. I looked at her and she seemed to look right through me even with no eyes. And then, the ashes crumbled. It crumbled and suddenly I was drowning in it. And maybe I was the ash woman or the ash woman was me. Because I was running for my life and I was wearing anklets that thrummed chaotically while I ran and I was dressed in white and the front of my saree was draped over my face and I couldn't see. 

*MEOW.*

Cold sweat. Cold sweat everywhere. I woke up and I was cold and wet until I wasn't because there was warm, dry fur sticking onto the sweat on my forehead. I laughed a startled laugh as I hugged Mia tighter. I didn't know what had just happened. Maybe it was a premonition or maybe it was just my period-craving dinner of cheesy chicken risotto disagreeing with me. But either way, I knew subconsciously that staying in that dream wouldn't have done me any good. 

I raised my hand and saw blood. I nearly screamed. I nearly screamed until I felt more blood trickle down my thighs and remembered that I was on my period. And I swore that I'd taken every precaution to stop a leak but somehow the bood was trickling down my thigh. And so, like any sane young woman who had just gotten the night terror to end all night terrors, I slept again. Knowing that I would regret it in the morning and dreading the amount of time and hydrogen peroxide I'd need to wash my sheets.

 *It is morning in my grandparents' village. My grandmother pulled a veil over her hair and face as she bowed to the shrine of the ancestors and the shrine of Maa Parvati, the mother goddess. My mother drove out every week to visit the shrine of the goddess of fertility, the goddess of strength, the goddess of wealth, and so on. And finally, she held a prayer for the goddess of sacrifice, Sati. The Goddess who had killed herself in myth, who had inspired a horrific, now-banned ritual of burning widows alive in my country.*

I woke up in the morning and groaned as the sun rays fell directly in my eyes and I felt the cat fur stick to my still-sweaty forehead. And for what must have been the first time in my life, I remembered my dreams vividly despite them not being nightmares. I had not thought of the goddess of the nine forms in a decade. 

Parvati, the wife of the Indian god Lord Shiva, the mythological god of destruction and death. She was rumored to be his other half, an Eve of sorts, fashioned by him to rule alongside him. She was a shape-shifter and tasked with maintaining balance in the worlds. And popular myth displayed her as the diety who took on the form of the nine goddesses who defeated the demons from the other realm during the festival of Navratri. I remembered my grandmother's lessons as I lay in bed recalling names I'd long forgotten how to pronounce.

*Chandraghanta, Skandamata, Kushmanda.* The warrior goddesses. They were the ones I'd idolised as a young girl, the fearless demon-slayers who wouldn't have been out of place in one of my animes. 

And with a triumphant cheer at having retained those names after all the years, I thought of more.*Mahagauri, Siddhidhatri, Brahmacharini, Katyayani.* They represented sacrifice and youth and chastity. They were the 'safe' goddesses. The ones I was told to worship.

My stomach jolted. 

I froze.

I was no stranger to suddenly getting cramps midway through my period, but this was not just a cramp. It felt like a tug. It felt like a pull.

*Shailaputri.* I spoke involuntarily. And as I did, my heart jolted to a stop and began to beat twenty times faster. Shailaputri was *Sati.* She was sacrifice. I knew I'd just done something wrong. *Think. THINK.* THINK.

Shit. Fuck. *Fucking Hell.* 

The goddess Shailaputri wore white. She wore anklets. She veiled her face in widow's veils. 

*""Your mother evaded me.""* 

She was standing in front of me. And she did not look happy. I could see her eyes senses at me from beneath her veils. Her fists were clenched and I could see red dripping out the corner. She was not tall. She stood several inches below me. But I remembered vividly that this was the goddess who had burnt herself to death over her husband's honor. She was *dangerous*. And I was in danger. I had been in danger ever since she had come to claim my mother all those years ago. And I was in danger when I'd touched that ash-filled saucepan. That saucepan had held a vengeful and burning spirit who had chosen me after my mother bested her. She had chosen me to bear the suffering that so many widows over the centuries had borne due to her choices.

I wondered what burning alive felt like. I wondered if I could cheat it.

I prayed for any saviour. Anyone. But no one came. I prayed again, I prayed for my mother. I prayed for Jaya Ma's spirit. I prayed for grandma to come and save me, but nobody did. 

She reached for me. I expected scalding burns. I expected hellfire. 

I saw a supernova of light instead. Just like in that dream. And then suddenly I was not myself anymore. I was in the year 1960 and I heard a strange figure call me my grandmother's name. And I was my grandmother as she fought for the right to go to school in an age where female children in small towns seldom did. And then I was nineteen and I was crying as I wore an intricate red saree and said my vows to a stranger who told my father that he'd treat me well. And I was at my husband's house and my mother-in-law was telling me that my face was too tempting. She instructed me to never step out of the house without a veil over my face. I was told I was sinful. I was told to only speak when I was spoken to and speak to naught but my husband. And I was being forced down and I was a mother and my son, my darling son, was born sickly. And I nearly lost him and I had a daughter. And she was my world but suddenly I was not myself anymore.

I blinked. I was in the void again, long having left my grandmother's being.

And then I was a child again. I was a young girl with big dreams and an even bigger voice in that same little town. And I grew up to hate my mother because she loved my dying brother more. And my father was my world and I was his little princess and he wanted me to become a doctor in an age where women rarely did so. And I was grown and I didn't become a doctor but I did get a college degree and my papa was proud of me still. And I met a man from the city who gave me the world but when I followed him to the city I realized that it wasn't what it seemed like. And he screamed at me every night and punched the walls and I cried myself to sleep and covered bruised with green cream and compact powder every morning. And I had a daughter and she was the only one who loved me. 

I was in the void again. And then I was myself.

I was *me*. Not my grandma or my mama. And I was a child wondering why daddy screamed all day and I was a teenager crying myself to sleep and it hurt. *It hurt so bad.* And I was eight years old and I'd just gotten my period earlier than I was supposed to and *it was mere days after I saw those ashes.* I blinked awake and saw the woman in white's hands on mine and everything hurt. My hips were on fire and I was kneeling from period cramps. The pain that had haunted me since I was eight, the pain that no doctors could diagnose and no painkillers could fully cure hitting me at full force and I could feel my vision dulling as I tried to stare at the woman in white.

""You."" I breathed. ""It was you all along! *You* gave me endless pain and a body I hated by the time I was ten! *You* made me cry myself to sleep for a week every month for the last fifteen years! I can't believe it was all you!""

""You must suffer."" she said. Eyes piercing into mine and hands gripping me tight. ""You must suffer. You must suffer for *his* honour. You must suffer, for balance -""

*""AAAAAAAHHHHHH!""*

Well both looked up at the piercing shriek. Followed by my cat, my little baby, mercifully unharmed by the woman in white, jumping into my lap. The woman in white was frozen in shock and let my hands go as Mia attempted to climb over my shoulders. And I heard a rustling. A very familiar rustling. I'd heard that rustling countless times in the past few days. I'd dismissed it initially and then I'd thought it was the woman in white, the woman who had made my grandmothers before me suffer, the woman who had ruined my life. 

But now, I knew it was a protector. ""Kalaratri!"" I whisper-screamed. 

I heard the creaking of bones and the stench of blood filled my room. But I was not scared. It was ironic, really, how Kalaratri was portrayed as the demon-goddess in the myths of the nine goddesses. The blue-skinned goddess with ten arms, holding weapons and blood and dressed in tiger skins, wearing a necklace of skulls over a bare chest with her matter hair flowing in a halo around her. And she looked furious too, but I had an inkling that she would not harm me. 

She extended a finger towards me. It was leathery and pointed and rough, but I did not flinch. ""You have suffered enough."" 

Mia purred. The goddess looked at me and gave a faint smile. ""Your mother was much more terrified of me.""

""I - you saved her too?"" I blinked. ""But there's no ash ritual here -""

""No ritual would save you."" she intoned, in a voice that sent chillds down my throat. ""The more you rebel, the more Shailaputri finds you.""

I gulped.

""But the more you endure, the more I find you."" she smiled faintly again. ""Resilience, sacrifice, they are two sides of a coin. You have borne so much. You have pained so much. She has followed you but you fought her long enough to let me reach you. You are a survivor, child.""

""I-""

""I also like cats. I rode one when I was the patron goddess of fertility."" she laughed breathily as she dissapeared. Mia screamed in goodbye.

In front of me, I could see the woman in white crumbling to ashes as the pain in my abdomen dulled and for the first time in fifteen years, I could not feel anything but the trickle of blood as my periods stopped hurting.

That night, I vowed that I would only ever have sons. The curse of the Goddess of Sacrifices ended with me. And I held Mia tighter to my chest as I woke up to a new day and wondered where I'd put that Hydrogen Peroxide solution.

I had a new life now. And I had the scariest goddess of them all to thank for it.

And sometimes when I sleep at nigjt, I hear the thudding of the skulls of her necklace and see the stench of blood, followed by my cat chasing the sounds and a laugh that makes me feel lighthearted once again. It is the laugh of a saviour. ",1,1761612737.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I’m here in Colombia for my third trip. Women have never been a reason to visit this incredible country because every country in the world has beautiful women and I’m not one of those passport bro types. I also don’t use dating apps because I’m here for the language, culture, food and nature; chasing girls would cut into that valuable time.

I met a very shy woman in an Airbnb in Medellín. We talked about basic things, but she stood out after opening up to me after a few days. We had brunch once, then hung out for a long while afterwards. She’s been single for a long time and seemed very sweet - but painfully shy - so I suggested that we create a profile for her on one of the dating apps where women have to make the first move.

She kept putting it off and she knew I was moving to another Airbnb. She suggested on the final day that we could meet for coffee and discuss it if I wanted to help her.

We started messaging on WhatsApp on the night I moved, before coffee happened. 3 hours of flirting had passed before I’d even noticed. My written Spanish absolutely isn't good enough for flirting; that's a high bar. However, this very kind Colombian woman didn’t complain. She also laughs at my ridiculous jokes, so I think it’s fair to say that she likes me.

It’s only been a little over a week, but I get to read real, casual Colombian Spanish every day and listen to her voice messages. It might not last, but it's good for now. And no, she's not just a pretty face; she's a good source of input, too!

🎯 Concept: “Bake & Decorate” – an Interactive Bakery Experience

Instead of just buying baked goods, customers come in to decorate or bake their own cookies, cupcakes, donuts, and cakes either from pre-made bases or from scratch with guided recipes. Think of it as a mix between a bakery, an entertainment activity, and a DIY studio.

✨ Key Features:
	•	Choose your treat (cake, cookie, donut, cupcake)
	•	Either bake from scratch using step-by-step instructions on a tablet (AI-guided), or start from a pre-baked base
	•	Decorate it yourself using a full toppings & icing bar
	•	Perfect for dates, families, birthdays, team-building, and friend hangouts
	•	Coffee bar + cozy seating area to enjoy finished desserts

⸻

🔄 What Customers Do While Their Items Are Baking (so they’re not just waiting):

Instead of downtime, this is part of the interactive experience:
	•	Prepare toppings, icings, and decorations at the topping stations
	•	Create a custom drink (hot chocolate bar or latte art corner)
	•	Social area with games, photo stations, and themed selfie spots
	•	Optional quick edible craft kits (like dipping strawberries or making chocolate molds)
	•	AI baking assistant screen that shows fun dessert trivia or helps plan next customization

⸻

🎯 Target Customers:
	•	Families with kids looking for indoor activities
	•	Couples/date nights
	•	Teens and friend groups (social media friendly)
	•	Companies for corporate team-building events
	•	People who want a creative experience rather than just purchasing food

⸻

❓ Questions for You:
	1.	Would you personally pay for this kind of experience? If yes, how much per person would feel reasonable?
	2.	Do you see this as a one-time novelty or something people might do regularly?
	3.	What do you see as the biggest risk or flaw in this concept?
	4.	If this existed in your city, would you try it? Why or why not?
	5.	Any ideas to make it more profitable or more appealing?

⸻

I’m based in Edmonton, Canada, where indoor experiences are in high demand during winter months, so I’m particularly curious if this business model has strong repeat potential in colder climates.

Please don’t hold back — I’m looking for real-world opinions, not compliments. Thank you! 🙏

Hello everyone!

I’m on the lookout for someone who embodies fun, kindness, silliness, and loyalty—essentially, someone who’s just eager to chat. I know this is Reddit, and I might only make one or two meaningful connections from this post, but hey, why not aim high and see what unfolds?

A little about me:

- My favorite colors are pink, white, and black.
- I have a serious love for iced coffee.
- I enjoy bookshops, brunch outings, small get-togethers, being surrounded by gorgeous flowers, and listening to some great music.

When it comes to music, I'm quite passionate about it! My taste ranges from big bands to Taylor Swift (don’t worry, I’m not an obsessed Swiftie, but I do adore her albums Folklore and Evermore).

I would say I have a vibrant personality; I live in the moment and embrace my free spirit. Of course, I do tend to overthink from time to time—just a part of being human! I consider myself confident, thoughtful, and straightforward.

I vote blue, so please only message me if you are similar in that sense. Also, if you spend a lot of time playing video games, don’t message me. 

I'm interested in chatting with individuals aged 25-46 who reside in the United States or Canada. Wishing everyone the best of luck in their search

1ohvrmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ohvrmg/ever_since_my_priest_broke_the_fifth_commandment/,"Ever since my priest broke the fifth commandment, my church has been cursed.","The greatest commandment in the Bible is to love God with all your heart. The second greatest commandment is to love one another. After that, it’s a bit of a free-for-all – but I’d probably give third place to the fifth of the Ten Commandments: do not murder.

Six months ago, our pastor, Zack, broke the fifth commandment. 

We loved God with the fullness of our hearts. We cared for the sick, the poor, the needy. We ran soup kitchens out of the back of our church, put on daycares for single mums, read to the elderly.

But because Zack broke the fifth commandment, it was as if our church had been cursed. Sometimes, when I was in church on my own, it felt as if God had abandoned the building, and something dark and hungry had taken His place.

Six months ago, after a Sunday evening service, Zack was locking up the church. He was on his own, had stayed late to finish preparing a midweek Bible study. Fiddling with the key in the lock, he’d felt someone tap him on the shoulder.

He’d turned around, expecting to see someone from our congregation – perhaps Martha, who had a terrible habit of leaving her Bible under her seat.

Instead, he saw a man he’d never met before. So close Zack could feel his stinking breath on his forehead.

Tall but wiry, in clothes that looked like they hadn’t been cleaned in years. Looked like he was in his sixties. Teeth all janky, foaming at the mouth. Wild eyes, like the eyes of a rabid animal – but focused, unblinking. Fixed on him.

And before Zack even knew what was happening, the man had handed him a knife. Zack says that the blade was already covered in blood, although no one ever figured out where the blood came from.

Zack later told us that he took a step back towards the church, pressed himself against the door, the knife in his hands. He said that there was no way he could have stopped what happened. Couldn’t have stopped the man from stepping forwards – and stepping forwards again – and again – and again. Until Zack’s hand was pressed against the man’s stomach, and the man’s lips were stained red.

Zack was a good person; he did all he could for the man. But the man bled out on the church’s welcome matt. Zack said that after he called for an ambulance, he prayed for him. While he prayed, the man never broke eye contact.

Zack told us that he believed the man actually smiled, grinned, before he died.

We found out the next morning. The next few months were some of the worst our church ever faced. Zack was arrested, questioned by the police. I even had to lead the midweek Bible study and preach my first sermon.

The church’s CCTV saved Zack. Proved that there really wasn’t much that Zack could have done. 

I told him exactly that when I sat with him one night, smoking cigarettes and drinking whisky on his porch. I can remember how badly his hands were shaking, how pale his face was.

‘You’re a good man, Zack,’ I told him. We talked about the act of killing in the Bible – the righteous war of the Israelites as they invaded Canaan, the slaughtering of the residents of Jericho. Holy destruction.

But something about Zack’s actions didn’t feel righteous. Deep down, I knew he’d done something terrible that night. He’d broken the fifth commandment. 

‘You’re a good man,’ I told him, but he wouldn’t meet my eyes. He just smoked and drank, until the sun began to rise.

The size of our congregation shrank drastically. We’d originally had around 130 weekly attendees, but within the course of a month, it’d gone down to about 60. Mostly older people, although a few families stayed.

It took about that long for the Holy Spirit to leave that place, for the darkness to set in.

It was a Tuesday night, during our kids’ group. Only three kids were there that week, and it was just me and my wife running the night. We told them the story of Daniel in the den of lions, made them popcorn and put on a film. Turned the lights off.

But one of the kids wasn’t interested. Ola, six years old. Tiny little thing, always quiet. 

During the film, she got out of her chair, wandered off. I followed her, retreating from the brightness of the projector screen, as she walked towards the back left corner of the room.

She stopped about five feet away from it. Pitch black. Could barely see anything at all. But Ola lifted up her hand, as if she was reaching out for something.

‘You’re missing the movie,’ I said, but Ola didn’t respond. Kept her hand held up, her palm now pointing at the ceiling. ‘Ola,’ I said, and she turned her head to look at me.

‘I’m talking,’ she told me, and then she turned to face the darkness again. 

Maybe my mind was playing tricks, but I swear that this corner was darker than anywhere else in the room. Black-out blinds dark. And cold. Like really, ridiculously cold.

‘Who are you talking to?’ I asked her.

She didn’t answer, wasn’t even paying attention to me – but she stumbled back a few steps. 

‘I don’t want to do that,’ she said. And then she dropped her hand to her side. 

Suddenly I didn’t feel so cold, and the corner didn’t look quite as dark. Ola span on her heels, ran back to her chair at the front of the church, scooped up a handful of popcorn from her bowl – as if nothing had happened.

I talked to my wife about it on the way back from church; she thought it was nothing. Spoke to Zack about it the next day – he took me a bit too seriously. Even put out his cigarette.

‘Pray,’ he told me. ‘When the whole world seems dark, that’s when you should pray.’ Stamped out his cigarette with the heel of his boot.

Weeks passed, nothing too strange to report – except for a feeling. A feeling that things weren’t quite right. A feeling that I shouldn’t be in the church on my own after dark, a feeling like something lurked behind every door. And a few odd stories. Things like:

The projector turned itself off in the middle of a service, so we had to resort to getting out a stack of old hymn books.

We turned up for our midweek Bible study to find a dead mouse next to the pulpit. Put out mousetraps all over the place but never found any more.

Ola told her parents that she’d seen a black goat roaming around the fields behind the church, with chains wrapped around its horns.

Martha left her Bible underneath her chair one night, but when she came to pick it up on the Monday morning, she found that it had been left in front of the entrance.

These were the kind of stories you might tell around a campfire to freak out a few kids, but we didn’t take it too seriously. We had too much on our plates already. Zack’s drinking habit was getting out of hand, and his sermons were becoming increasingly incomprehensible. Our church was dwindling in size. Teenagers were filming TikToks in front of the building, calling it the ‘Murder Church’.

It's not as if we were moving on from what had happened – it was impossible to move on. But we really did believe that God would one day come back to this building, would make it His home again.

I first realised that He was well and truly gone two months ago. 

Tuesday night, kids’ group. Me, my wife, Ola and two other girls – no one else in the church. Zack was letting us use his office, which was upstairs in the church, next to the sports hall. We were leading a Bible study on David and Goliath, and my wife and I were far more interested than the girls were.

About thirty minutes into the study, Ola told my wife that she needed to go to the toilet. My wife offered to escort her. Ola turned her down, and then my wife insisted. So off they went together, leaving me and the two girls alone.

Zack’s office is a small room, lined with tall bookcases – thousands of old Bible commentaries. A big desk next to the window, embroidered with coffee rings. A giant lamp as the main source of light. Some beanbags, for any casual meetings – those are what we were sat on that night.

And a thick, heavy door – the kind of door you’d have to shove to open. 

Beyond the door, the staircase.

The girls and I were waiting for my wife and Ola to return when we heard the footsteps. Right at the bottom of the stairs – a dense thud, as if someone had put all of their weight into their foot.

There was a long moment of silence, just long enough that I thought I’d imagined it. Then – 

Thud. Thud. Thud. Faster now, but just as firm, just as heavy – working their way up the stairs. There are fourteen stairs that lead to Zack’s office and the sports hall. Whoever was coming up these stairs in that moment was making short work of them.

The girls pulled each other close. I could see how terrified they were. To be honest, even though I thought it was probably just my wife playing a prank on me, I was pretty freaked out, too. 

And those footsteps were getting closer – thud, thud, thud. Only, as they were getting closer, it was if they were becoming quieter, lighter, softer – as if whatever was making its way up the stairs had paws or hooves. And there was a new sound, something I could just about make out. The rattling of chains.

The footsteps continued once whoever – or whatever – this was had reached the stop of the stairs. They stopped right outside the door. Then there was silence.

‘Who’s there?’ I called out. ‘Ruth, is that you?' 

No answer.

‘Ruth?’

The door handle turned, kept turning, twisted unnaturally far – and then the door slowly swung open. This was a heavy door, remember – but the door opened smoothly, without resistance. On the other side, all I could see was darkness.

Then I heard the scream. A heart-wrenching, terrified scream. Somewhere deep within the church. My wife. Ruth.

Instinct kicked in. Suddenly I didn’t give a crap about whatever was lurking in the darkness. I knew that my wife was in danger, and I needed to get to her. So I told the girls to stay in Zack’s office, took a deep breath and then flung myself out of the room.

No one was in the hallway, although I felt as if I was being watched from all sides. But I didn’t have time to dwell on that.

I threw myself down the stairs, ran towards the restrooms. Found my wife stood outside the ladies’, bawling her eyes out, her skin prickled with goosebumps. I couldn’t get a word out of her, except for that she didn’t know where Ola was.

I knew exactly where she’d be. I found her stood near the back corner of the church main hall, the corner a black abyss leaking out into the room. Ola was silent, her hand stretched out into the shadows.

‘I don’t want to,’ she said again. And then, out of the shadows, a hand reached out and touched hers. A big hand, a man’s hand. 

I just about stopped myself from screaming, and I was glad that I did – because a moment later, the man in the corner stepped out of the darkness and revealed himself. Zack. Clearly drunk, with an unlit cigarette hanging out of his mouth.

‘You should get back to your Bible study,’ he told Ola, slurring his words. 

Ola didn’t go back to her study. I called her parents; called the other girls’ parents, too. I also called the rest of the church’s elders, and I recommended that Zack should be encouraged to take a sabbatical.

I even drove him to the airport that weekend. We didn’t say a word to one another, but Zack didn’t look well. He hadn’t shaved in a while, and he definitely hadn’t washed. After he took his suitcase out of the bunk of my car, I prayed for him and sent him on his way.

It took until that night for my wife to tell me what had happened to her in the restroom. She didn’t tell me much; she was far too embarrassed to elaborate. But what she did say is that when she left her toilet stall, she saw something stood in the doorway.

A black goat, about as big as a wolf, with chains wrapped around its horns. Staring right at her.

We stopped going to church after that. I hadn’t given up on God, certainly hadn’t turned away from my faith – but I’d definitely distanced myself from my church. I wanted nothing to do with it, didn’t want to talk about it.

I even ignored Zack’s texts, the few attempts at calls that he made. I’m ashamed to say that I blocked his number.

When I heard from an elder last week that Zack hadn’t returned from his sabbatical, I didn’t think much of it. I had too much going on in my own life. Ruth and I both weren’t sleeping well, and we were arguing more. She clearly couldn’t stop thinking about that night, but she wouldn’t talk to me about it.

To be honest, we’d been working hard to put this chapter of our lives behind us. But that changed two nights ago.

I received a phone call from Ola’s mom. Almost didn’t pick up, and I kind of wish that I hadn’t.

She had a story to tell me, through tears and panic and stress. Because two nights ago, Ola had been at the kids’ group. And one of the elders had found her stood in that dark corner of the church, facing the shadows, with her hand stretched out.

‘I don’t want to,’ she’d said. Then a man’s hand had reached out to touch hers. Only this hand had been holding a knife, already slick with blood. A knife that settled in Ola’s open palm.

Apparently Ola stood dead still as the man walked out of the shadows, a tall and wiry man with dirty clothes and a stinking breath – a man who walked straight into the blade, without hesitation. Apparently Zack died with a big grin on his face, and with eyes as wild as an animal’s.

I hung up the phone, blocked Ola’s number. Didn’t tell my wife.

Last night, I woke up to find Zack sat at the end of my bed.

His face was thick with sweat, his eyes blazing with fury – and there was a lit cigarette hanging out of his mouth. In the doorway, I saw a black goat, almost as large as a man, with chains wrapped around its horns.

And in Zack’s right hand, I saw that he gripped a knife – held out towards me. *I don’t want it,* I thought – and he smiled in response. 

I woke up to find that my room was empty, and that Ruth was fast asleep. But I’ve written this story down because I want someone to know that if I ever break the fifth commandment, it won’t be out of choice. 

I’ve also written this down because I want someone to pray for me. The whole world seems dark, and I need prayer. It didn’t work for Zack, but maybe it will work for me.

I’m at work walking down one of the aisles, when a lady stops me and says “coffee” and then stares at me for a response? Ignoring the lack of greeting and her rudeness since it’s 8 in the morning and I’m not a morning person, I ask which type of coffee she wants. She again repeats coffee without giving any other information. I ask if she wants the bags that get poured in coffee pots or if she wants the glass bottles/cans of coffee that are ready to be drunk instantly as these are the two kinds we have and they are in different aisles. She again gives me a simple coffee and just stares, now looking angrier. I just told her aisle 6, the aisle for the bags of coffee, and she walked away. About 20 minutes later, our morning manager passes by and stops me to ask about coffee lady. Turns out she knows more than one word, and was angry enough to actually use them to complain and throw a fit. It was Keurig cups that she wanted, but the Christmas flavors. Regular Keurig cups are down aisle 6 with the bags of coffee, but we don’t have the Christmas flavors yet or keep them there. If she had just explained, I would have told her those would have been set up on a special display in the next week or two after Halloween ended.

1ohvq5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/CuriousAF/comments/1ohvq5f/selfimprovement_trick_yourself_into_productivity/,[Self-Improvement] Trick yourself into productivity the same way you trick yourself into procrastination,"If we’re being honest, most people don’t fail because they lack talent. They fail because they never start. They wait for motivation like it’s some magical lightning bolt. But motivation is flaky. What’s painfully common in our generation isn’t laziness — it’s the constant cycle of overthinking, perfectionism, and dopamine-chasing habits that destroy our focus.

You tell yourself you’ll “just scroll TikTok for 5 minutes.” Two hours vanish. You convince yourself you’ll “work better under pressure,” then binge Netflix through the deadline. You’re not lazy. You’ve just mastered the art of self-sabotage through small, believable lies.

What if you could reverse-engineer that same psychology to make productivity automatic?

I went deep into research across behavioral science, psychology, and neuroscience. Dug into books, podcasts, and expert interviews. What I found was simple: You don’t need to overcome procrastination with willpower. You just need to use the same mind tricks that procrastination uses on you — but flip them.

Here’s the breakdown:

1. **Use the “momentum lie” on yourself**  
Instead of telling yourself “I’ll finish the whole thing today,” trick your brain with the same lie you use to procrastinate. Tell yourself, “I’ll just do 5 minutes.”  
This is based on the Zeigarnik Effect — unfinished tasks stick in your brain. Once you start, your mind wants to finish. James Clear (author of *Atomic Habits*) calls this the ""2-minute rule,"" but it works even better when you pretend you're not really working. Just dabble. Then momentum takes over.

2. **Hijack your dopamine system with micro rewards**  
According to Dr. Anna Lembke (*Dopamine Nation*), your brain craves novelty and quick hits of reward. That’s why social media is addictive. But you can hijack it:  
Break tasks into tiny steps. After each, reward yourself immediately — like listening to one hype song, eating a snack, or checking off a box.  
Behavioral economist Katy Milkman calls this “temptation bundling” — pairing a hard task with instant gratification.

3. **Install “friction walls” between you and distractions**  
You procrastinate because your distractions are one tap away. Make them harder to reach.  
Log out of all apps. Use website blockers like Freedom or Cold Turkey. Physically put your phone in a box or another room.  
This is supported by BJ Fogg’s *Tiny Habits* research — if something’s harder to do, you’ll do it less.  
Same reason you never eat raw pasta even though it’s in your kitchen. It’s annoying.

4. **Gamify boring tasks like a villain origin story**  
Productivity is boring because it feels like drudgery. But games? Games are full of progress bars, levels, and quests.  
Use tools like Habitica or Goblin.Tools to turn your to-do list into a role-playing game.  
As Nir Eyal explains in *Indistractable*, creating a sense of agency and progress gives you a dopamine hit that makes you come back.

5. **Use identity-based habits instead of outcome-based goals**  
Don’t say “I want to write a book.” Say “I am the type of person who writes 100 words a day.”  
This comes from James Clear again. You’re more consistent when you tie action to identity.  
It’s not about motivation. It’s about proving to yourself that you’re someone who does the thing.

6. **Use “time anchoring” to create automatic ritual**  
Your brain loves routines. Attach your most important task to something you already do daily.  
Always write after coffee. Always review goals before lunch. Always stretch after brushing teeth.  
Charles Duhigg in *The Power of Habit* explains that these “cue-routine-reward” loops are the foundation of habit change.

7. **Flood your subconscious with practical knowledge (without forcing it)**  
Sometimes your problem isn’t just procrastination — it’s not knowing where to start. Or not feeling ready. One of the most effective long-term strategies is passive learning.  
That’s where BeFreed comes in. It’s a smart AI-powered learning app built by a team from Columbia University. It turns expert books, research, and real-world frameworks into personalized podcasts based on your goals.  
So if you want to get better at focus, time management, or systems thinking, you can pick those themes — and BeFreed builds you a custom learning plan. It even adapts from your listening habits and builds a personal learning roadmap over time. You can pick how deep you go (10, 20, or 40 mins), and even choose your host's voice style.  
It also covers all the books and podcasts I’ve listed below and more. If you’re too busy to read but want to upgrade how you think, this one’s a no-brainer.

8. **This book will make you rethink everything you know about doing hard things**  
*The War of Art* by Steven Pressfield. This is hands down the best book I’ve ever read about beating resistance. Pressfield is a former screenwriter who battled years of procrastination. His writing hits like a punch in the gut.  
It’s not soft inspiration. It’s truth. That voice in your head telling you to delay, avoid, and scroll? That’s Resistance. Your job is to fight it like a pro.  
It’s short, sharp, and life-altering. Bestseller. Loved by creators and entrepreneurs. A must-read if you struggle to start.

9. **Podcast that feels like a therapy session and productivity masterclass in one**  
*The Tim Ferriss Show* — Tim interviews high-performance people across fields: authors, athletes, investors, creators. Every episode gives you tools, routines, and mental frameworks.  
Start with the episodes with James Clear, Derek Sivers, or Naval Ravikant. They’re packed with mental models for doing deep work, overcoming blocks, and building systems.

10. **YouTube rabbit hole that actually helps you focus**  
Ali Abdaal’s channel. A former doctor turned productivity nerd. He breaks down science-backed strategies on studying, time management, and building habits — in a super chill, non-preachy way.  
His videos on “How I trick my brain to do hard tasks” and “The productivity system that changed my life” are gold.

Procrastination isn’t some identity flaw. It’s just a system running in the background. You’ve already been tricking yourself into inaction. Now it’s time to use those same mind games to move forward.

1ohvpws,https://www.reddit.com/r/thesidehustle/comments/1ohvpws/sweepstakes_casino_hustle_for_canadians_my/,Sweepstakes Casino hustle for Canadians: My experience,"Hi all,

I wanted to share my experience with the “sweeps casino” side hustle that’s been circulating online lately, specifically from the perspective of a Canadian.

There are far fewer sweepstakes-style casinos available to Canadians compared to Americans, which made the setup a bit trickier. Still, after going through the hassle of getting everything figured out, it’s been worth it.

I’ve been doing this for a few months now, and I’ve made a couple thousand dollars in total. It’s not life-changing money, but it’s a solid, low-effort side hustle that fits nicely into my routine. I usually just collect the daily free tokens while having my morning coffee. It takes maybe five minutes. Then, once or twice a month on a Friday night, I’ll play through those free tokens and try to convert them into redeemable tokens.

The nice thing is that there’s no real “buy-in” required if you’re patient. It’s all about consistency — collecting your daily bonuses, playing smart, and cashing out when you hit something worthwhile.

If anyone else here is doing this from Canada, I’d be curious to hear which sites you’ve had success with or how your experience compares. I can also share a few of the ones I’ve found that actually work here.",2,1761612161.0,thesidehustle,0,1.0,False

🎯 Concept: “Bake & Decorate” – an Interactive Bakery Experience

Instead of just buying baked goods, customers come in to decorate or bake their own cookies, cupcakes, donuts, and cakes either from pre-made bases or from scratch with guided recipes. Think of it as a mix between a bakery, an entertainment activity, and a DIY studio.

✨ Key Features:
	•	Choose your treat (cake, cookie, donut, cupcake)
	•	Either bake from scratch using step-by-step instructions on a tablet ,or start from a pre-baked base
	•	Decorate it yourself using a full toppings & icing bar
	•	Perfect for dates, families, birthdays, team-building, and friend hangouts
	•	Coffee bar + cozy seating area to enjoy finished desserts

⸻

🔄 What Customers Do While Their Items Are Baking (so they’re not just waiting):

Instead of downtime, this is part of the interactive experience:
	•	Prepare toppings, icings, and decorations at the topping stations
	•	Create a custom drink (hot chocolate bar or latte art corner)
	•	Social area with games, photo stations, and themed selfie spots
	•	Optional quick edible craft kits (like dipping strawberries or making chocolate molds)
	•	baking assistant screen that shows fun dessert trivia or helps plan next customization


🎯 Target Customers:
	•	Families with kids looking for indoor activities
	•	Couples/date nights
	•	Teens and friend groups (social media friendly)
	•	Companies for corporate team-building events
	•	People who want a creative experience rather than just purchasing food


❓ Questions for You:
	1.	Would you personally pay for this kind of experience? If yes, how much per person would feel reasonable?
	2.	Do you see this as a one-time novelty or something people might do regularly?
	3.	What do you see as the biggest risk or flaw in this concept?
	4.	If this existed in your city, would you try it? Why or why not?
	5.	Any ideas to make it more profitable or more appealing?

I’m based in Edmonton, Canada, where indoor experiences are in high demand during winter months, so I’m particularly curious if this business model has strong repeat potential in colder climates.

Please don’t hold back — I’m looking for real-world opinions, not compliments. Thank you! 🙏

It hit me the other day: I wasn’t using them right! I was so busy chasing the *next* big thing, I forgot to actually *learn* the stuff I already had. D’oh!

I realized I was trying to build a mansion on a foundation of… well, nothing.

Does that make sense? Like, you need the skills before you can truly leverage the tech, right?

I was chatting with a friend about this (over way too much coffee, naturally), and he pointed me to this program – it's called AutomateItPro (here's the link if you're curious: https://whop.com/automateit/automateitpro?a=liveitupdeals
). He swore it *actually* teaches you how to *use* these tools to make real money.

And honestly? It's been a game-changer. Finally, I'm understanding the *why* behind the *how*.

It’s like… remember when you first learned to drive? You knew the basics, but you didn’t *really* know until you’d been on the road for a while and started to get the *feel* of it? This feels like that, but for AI.

Things I’ve been trying to improve include:

*   Figuring out effective prompt engineering
*   Understanding how to connect different AI tools together
*   Making passive income with simple automation

Maybe you’re already there, cruising along. But if you’re like me, and you’ve been feeling a bit lost in the AI wilderness, maybe some focused upskilling is the answer?

Many things made cry that I mentioned to him:


-My friend of years silently judging me bc I don’t hookup with guys, I had a different college experience (online) and didn’t do university and socialize with people. I said I shouldn’t have to be judged or called a prude for choosing different than the culture right now, especially when I never judged her. He wholeheartedly agreed.
-I have horrible anxiety with going out in public and dealing with people at work. It’s since gotten better with prayer and journaling! 
-I feel like I’ve been slacking in my relationship with God. I read my Bible every night before bed for some years now, but I don’t think I talk to God enough or study the Bible enough. 
-my mom and I are kinda isolated from judgy family members and so-called friends, it’s always me and her. But life is peaceful.

I cried throughout the whole talk and he even welled up at the end. It was nice to talk to him and he reassured me in what I was feeling. I tend to over apologize for so many things and I thanked him a lot even in email after it was over. Idk why I just felt really embarrassed for feeling emotional.

No strings attached, no expectations, just two people being human for a second.

This weekend, I was in line at a coffee shop and had an impulse to turn around. Behind me stood a woman, maybe in her thirties, quiet and still. There was a heaviness in her eyes that most people would overlook.

Without thinking, I said...

“You know, someone did something nice for me a couple of days ago, and I am going to pay it forward by buying you coffee. Get whatever you want.”

She stared at me for a few seconds, then tears began to fall.  
She told me she had been having a terrible day and that this was the kindest thing that had happened to her all week.

I said, “Hey, you are not alone. I have bad days too. They suck.”

We ordered our coffees and waited. She began to soften. Breathing a little deeper, shoulders lowering. Maybe it was the reminder that she was seen, that life still has warmth in it. When it was time to go, I decided to reach out and hug her.  Something I and well, most of us do not do.  The power of a hug can move mountains when done at the right time in someone’s life.

“It will pass. Good luck to you.”

She smiled, and that was it.  
No exchange of names, no long-term love connection needed, no expectation of seeing each other again. Just a moment.

We walked out and she was far enough behind me that it did not warrant anymore words.  As I drove off, I looked down the parking lot to avoid any cars, and I saw her standing next to her truck watching me drive off.  I thought, I really hope that filled her Relationship and Health buckets to get through what she was dealing with.  Sometimes, that is all it takes.

**The Relationship Bucket**

Not every connection is meant to last.  
Sometimes, the value is in the moment itself.

Our Relationship Bucket does not fill only through family, lifelong friends, or romantic partners. It fills when we connect, when we share kindness, empathy, or humanity with anyone. Some relationships last years; others last minutes. Both matter.

I always say “Everything Ends. “Conversations, seasons, even entire chapters of life. But that does not mean they were not valuable. The fullness comes from being present enough to notice the moment while it is here.

That brief exchange in the coffee shop was not about changing someone’s life. It was about reminding both of us that connection still exists. And sometimes, that is enough to refill the bucket.

1ohvg7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/CuriousAF/comments/1ohvg7a/advice_how_to_start_turning_your_life_around/,[Advice] How to start turning your life around (without joining a cult or buying a $300 planner),"Every week, I hear some version of this: “I want to fix my life, but I don’t know where to start.” It’s a weirdly common thing right now. People who feel stuck, always scrolling, watching others glow up on TikTok, buying productivity apps they never open, and still feeling like they're falling behind. It’s not laziness. It’s not that you don’t care. A lot of us are just overwhelmed, misinformed, and totally exhausted by the endless stream of bad advice from shiny influencers who treat life like a brand collab.

So I spent time digging through actual research, expert interviews, and some really good books, podcasts, and tools. This isn’t hustle culture or some cringe “rise & grind” list. This is a practical, no BS roadmap to help you get out of that stuck place and start building a life that actually feels like yours again.

Here’s what actually helps when you want to turn your life around but don’t know where to start:

1. Start by tracking your inputs, not just your goals  
Most advice jumps to “set goals.” But you can’t change what you don’t see. According to James Clear (author of *Atomic Habits*), your habits are your identity in motion. Track your default settings for one week: what you eat, how much you scroll, when you sleep, and what your brain consumes. Don’t judge it. Just notice. Awareness is the first big unlock.

2. Reduce your dopamine spikes  
Your brain’s reward system is hijacked. Social media, junk food, binge-watching—it’s all designed to keep you on a loop. Dr. Anna Lembke, Stanford psychiatrist and author of *Dopamine Nation*, explains how chronic dopamine overload leads to numbness and low motivation. The fix isn’t to quit everything. It’s to create balance. Try “dopamine fasting” for small chunks: no phone before 9am, no IG after dinner. It’s uncomfortable at first, but it resets your baseline.

3. Turn your phone into a training tool  
Use your phone to rewire instead of distract. Two apps I actually recommend:  
- **BeFreed**: This is a wild one. It’s an AI-powered learning app made by a team from Columbia University. BeFreed turns books, research, and expert talks into audio lessons or podcasts tailored to your goals. It lets you pick the topic, time (10, 20, or deep 40 min), and even the voice of your host (mine sounds like someone who drinks black coffee and gives no BS). The coolest part? It adapts to what you learn and builds a personalized roadmap over time. Perfect for people trying to rebuild their mindset but hate fluff. It also covers every book and podcast I mention in this post.  
- **Fabulous**: Behavioral science-based daily rituals. It’s gamified habit stacking without being annoying. Helps you build small wins like morning routines, digital detoxes, or journaling habits.

4. Design your environment like you’re designing your brain  
Behavioral economist Katy Milkman (author of *How to Change*) says most good decisions are friction-based. Want to read more? Put a book on your pillow. Want to scroll less? Log out of your social media. Want to work out? Sleep in your gym clothes. Your environment should make the right choice easier. Small tweaks work better than big intentions.

5. Be consistent, not extreme  
Most people fail because they go too hard, too fast. You don’t need to wake up at 5am or do 75 hard. You just need to show up every day at 70%. Research from Angela Duckworth (author of *Grit*) shows that long-term consistency beats intensity. Commit to something doable daily: 10 push-ups, 5 mins of meditation, 1 page of journaling. Stack those over 30 days and you’ll feel it.

6. Watch this insane YouTube series if you’re stuck  
Ali Abdaal’s “Feel-Good Productivity” series is criminally underrated. He’s a doctor who went deep into science-backed productivity that doesn’t feel like punishment. Episode 3 on “How to Get Unstuck” breaks down why we freeze and the psychology behind friction, perfectionism, and shame. It’s binge-worthy in the best way.

7. Read this book if your brain feels messy  
**The Mountain Is You** by Brianna Wiest: This book will make you question everything you think you know about self-sabotage. Wiest is a bestselling author known for writing about emotional intelligence and self-awareness in a raw, non-preachy way. This book hits hard. She gets into why we stay in our own way, how to start choosing differently, and how to rebuild your self-trust. It’s an insanely good read. If your life feels like a storm, this is the book to help you rebuild from the inside.

8. Listen to this podcast when you're spiraling  
**The Huberman Lab**: Especially his episode on “How to Rewire Your Brain.” Dr. Andrew Huberman is a Stanford neuroscientist who makes brain science actually usable. He breaks down how habits form, how to reset them, and how to train attention and focus. Sounds nerdy. But it's got real tools. Like the 90-second rule to interrupt anxiety loops. And how to build strong habits with just 10 minutes a day.

9. Take this one question seriously  
“What would this look like if it were easy?” It’s from Tim Ferriss. Sounds cheesy. But it’s a pattern interrupt. Most of us make change harder than it needs to be. What if working out wasn’t 1 hour of pain but 10 mins of dancing to one song? What if journaling wasn’t 3 pages but just one sentence each morning? Reduce the friction. Make it stupidly easy.

10. Don’t restart your whole life. Restart one hour  
Your brain can’t do a life overhaul. Too many variables. But it can do one thing for one hour. Pick one hour of your day to protect and redesign. It could be your power hour in the morning, or 8 to 9 pm as a sacred reset. Use that hour to do something that makes you feel human again. Read. Write. Meditate. Walk. Reflect. Protect that hour like your inner life depends on it. Because it kind of does.",1,1761611423.0,CuriousAF,0,1.0,False

You signed up for lunches, math homework, and trying to find mittens that vanish faster than a promise in a press conference.

But here we are, again. Another “emergency,” another big hammer. This time it’s the notwithstanding clause—Ottawa’s fire axe hung behind the glass for true crises—smashed open to clamp shut a strike by the very people who teach your kids what rights are.

Government message? “Relax. Classes resume Wednesday.”
Translation? “Hush now. The rules are for you, not for us.” 

They say it’s about “stability.” Funny how stability always seems to arrive wearing work boots and carrying a truncheon for someone else’s freedoms. Don’t worry, they add, it’s “temporary”—up to five years, which, if you’re a Grade 2 student today, is the difference between sounding out cat and writing your first essay on why Dad keeps muttering “Section 33” into his coffee. 

Let’s do the greatest hits:

The Kids.
Every politician suddenly loves yours like their own. They clutch a photo-op backpack and say “back to normal” while they bulldoze the road to get there. The bill even dusts off terms teachers already rejected, then calls it compromise. That isn’t bargaining; that’s a take-it-or-take-a-fine. 

The Fines.
Parents pay fees. Government levies fines. Teachers face the kind that make a mortgage tremble; their union, the sort that would buy new roofs for a dozen schools. That’s not a conversation; that’s a threat dressed as policy. 

The Precedent.
Today it’s teachers. Tomorrow—pick a union, pick a protest, pick any inconvenient noise. “Unique situation,” they say. Sure. Unique like that last time and the next time. The fire axe is getting a lot of wall time these days. 

Now, if you’re a decent, caring family—and around here, most are—you spend your evenings refereeing fairness. You tell your kids: use your words; listen even when you’re mad; fix it together. When grown-ups can’t keep that basic playground treaty, they don’t get to lecture the sandbox about sharing.

But the UCP’s message to families is clear: Rights are optional if they slow us down. Optional like seatbelts, I guess—until the day you really need one.

We’re told critics are “playing politics.” Neat trick. Suspend rights with a shrug, then accuse everyone else of theatre. Meanwhile, parents juggle jobs, child care, and the long drive on Deerfoot wondering why the people who love “freedom” keep reaching for the override button any time a free citizen stands in their way.

Let’s try the kitchen-table test:

Would you let your kid “win” a sibling fight by declaring themselves referee, rule-maker, and timekeeper?

Would you allow them to staple last week’s failed chore chart to the fridge and call it a “deal”?

Would you clap when they fine their sister for complaining?


No? Then why clap now.

We keep hearing that classrooms must be open, learning must continue, families need certainty. True, true, and true. But certainty built on shortcuts and strong-arming isn’t certainty; it’s a bad habit. If the province can’t bargain a contract without the constitutional sledge, that’s not toughness—it’s an admission of failure. And the billboards should say so.

What did teachers ask for? Smaller classes, workable conditions, a transparent deal not stapled together in a war room at 2 a.m. You can disagree with tactics and timing; you can curse the strike while still recognizing that suspending rights to end it is the civic equivalent of using a snowplow to clear your driveway—and your neighbour’s fence while you’re at it.

Here’s the part the government won’t say out loud: this was a choice.
They chose speed over legitimacy. They chose to gamble that families would cheer the quick fix and forget the fine print. They chose the easy headline over the hard work of persuasion.

And that’s the embarrassment.

Because decent families in this province are tired—tired of being told they’re the priority while their priorities are used as props; tired of being asked to trade rights for convenience like we’re swapping hockey cards on the bench. We don’t raise our kids to bully, to dodge accountability, or to call might “right.” We teach them to earn their wins.

You want kids back in class? So do we. You want stability? Us too. But don’t insult parents by pretending that overriding is the same as governing. One is a lever you pull when you’ve run out of ideas. The other is the grind: listening, revising, returning to the table until the people who have to live with the deal can live with the deal.

On Wednesday morning, the bell will ring. Backpacks will zip. Teachers will teach. Kids will learn about the Charter from someone who just had theirs stepped on. And at the end of the day, decent, caring families will sit down to supper and try to explain how a government that keeps shouting “respect” can’t seem to show any.

That’s not leadership.
That’s not conservative.
That’s not Alberta.

That’s an embarrassment.",86,1761611399.0,alberta,7,0.97,False

I haven’t drank at all either, it makes the cravings alot worse for me and I’ve just been trying to think how all I feel now is regret when I gave up and it’s really been helping me. I also like to think of how far I’ve come. I used to drive extremely far for the sole purpose of going to buy one (shop that does not id was 60km away). What’s helped me most was my boyfriend quitting with me, and my friends understanding that I cannot hangout for at least a week or two. I no longer feel the need to have to drive to get it and I haven’t noticed improvements in my skin yet but I think it’s supposed to purge first. I just wanted everyone to know that it is hard and it feels impossible until it isn’t. Another thing that helps is going to the gym or doing some form of exercise that works out your heart/lungs, I feel like it helped my cravings the most. Also try and refrain from caffeine, whenever I was craving a vape, I had this anxious knot in my stomach and throat, which caffeine also gives me. I was also just used to having one while drinking coffee. But good luck to anyone else who’s trying to do the same, its okay to want to hit it, its apart of the process, just give yourself the time you need. You can do it!

Start a New Farm or continue on Old One?,"Asking on here since when i Google ""New things in Stardew Valley"" it seems that there is for sure a lot of new content, but I was wondering what it is like for someone who has potentially been playing on an old map. 

To give a frame of reference, the last time I played consistently was about 2018/2019. I remember pretty much maxing all the caps I could at the time... complete museum, Greenhouse full of ancient fruit, had a full winery setup in barns to turn into ancient fruit wine, sheds full of diamond crystalariums, maxed out relationships, got to floor 200+ i believe to farm iridium ore, etc. I believe i made it to year 17 or so and had way more money than I would ever need, and couldn't find anything to spend it on besides coffee and salads.

From what I have heard, they have added a lot of new events such as a night market? Some new dialogue to the classic cast as well. 

My question for the more recent players is this: Can all the new content be experienced on an old file or is it worth just making a new farm and starting from scratch, and has the core gameplay progression changed in a meaningful way? I don't think I would be interested if they just added one or two npcs and just a few more crops to grow since I still see no motivation to purely chase money earned on the farm. I am sure there are many more things to experience but I am truly wondering how the game is different when directly comparing it to how it was at its near launch.

No strings attached, no expectations, just two people being human for a second.

This weekend, I was in line at a coffee shop and had an impulse to turn around. Behind me stood a woman, maybe in her thirties, quiet and still. There was a heaviness in her eyes that most people would overlook.

Without thinking, I said...

“You know, someone did something nice for me a couple of days ago, and I am going to pay it forward by buying you coffee. Get whatever you want.”

She stared at me for a few seconds, then tears began to fall.  
She told me she had been having a terrible day and that this was the kindest thing that had happened to her all week.

I said, “Hey, you are not alone. I have bad days too. They suck.”

We ordered our coffees and waited. She began to soften. Breathing a little deeper, shoulders lowering. Maybe it was the reminder that she was seen, that life still has warmth in it. When it was time to go, I decided to reach out and hug her.  Something I and well, most of us do not do.  The power of a hug can move mountains when done at the right time in someone’s life.

“It will pass. Good luck to you.”

She smiled, and that was it.  
No exchange of names, no long-term love connection needed, no expectation of seeing each other again. Just a moment.

We walked out and she was far enough behind me that it did not warrant anymore words.  As I drove off, I looked down the parking lot to avoid any cars, and I saw her standing next to her truck watching me drive off.  I thought, I really hope that filled her Relationship and Health buckets to get through what she was dealing with.  Sometimes, that is all it takes.

**The Relationship Bucket**

Not every connection is meant to last.  
Sometimes, the value is in the moment itself.

Our Relationship Bucket does not fill only through family, lifelong friends, or romantic partners. It fills when we connect, when we share kindness, empathy, or humanity with anyone. Some relationships last years; others last minutes. Both matter.

I always say “Everything Ends. “Conversations, seasons, even entire chapters of life. But that does not mean they were not valuable. The fullness comes from being present enough to notice the moment while it is here.

That brief exchange in the coffee shop was not about changing someone’s life. It was about reminding both of us that connection still exists. And sometimes, that is enough to refill the bucket.

Part of me did think about driving back to her and engaging in a conversation around seeing each other again.  But that was not why we were brought together in this moment.  It was just a moment.  It reminded me to be generous and engage with people.  It reminded her that there are still those who care.

I’m 23F and looking to find that special person. First off, I’m totally blind, and autistic, which I know may be a dealbreaker for some. I just graduated with my bachelor’s degree and I’m currently looking for work. Currently in a bit of crisis as to what I want to do with my life, but I know I want to help as many people as possible. 
I’m definitely a cat lover. I only have one cat right now but want more in the future. She’s three and has no cat instincts what so ever. I love reading, DND, cryptids, mythology, horror movies, and animated movies and TV shows. Definitely a big fan of Star Wars, Marvel, DC comics, Lord of the Rings, all that. Former Harry Potter fan, though if you’d like to have a yap session where we talk about the problematic stuff we missed and all our most cringe wizarding world memories, I’m down. I would like to eventually write a short story anthology and a horror comedy novel. My simple pleasures include slow nature walks, rain, the first cup of coffee of the day, and everything about the fall season. 
I’m currently on the fence about kids. I’m 100% okay with not having them, but please no child haters, as I’d like to work with kids in the future, and would like to find someone else who takes the wellbeing of kids seriously. I was raised Christian but now consider myself more spiritual. I’m open to dating women of any religious affiliation, as long as we can be respectful. 

My personality is rather wholesome and cosy, so I’m looking for an adventurous spirit to balance me out. I love to laugh, to not take life too seriously, and to always be learning. More than anything, I am just seeking the kid of love that feels like walking into a safe place. I hope to find that here.

I’d prefer to find someone between the ages of 22 and 32, but I’m open to dating older than that. I’m about an hour away from Pittsburgh. Being able to physically meet is very important to me, so I’d really like to find someone in the mid-Atlantic or Appalachian US.

We’re both students, but she’s only here for a few months as an exchange student, so there’s already a built-in expiration date if anything were to happen. We’ve been hanging out on campus the past couple weeks — coffee, random walks, a movie date. Nothing sexual has happened between us yet, not even holding hands, but the connection and comfort feel real.

Here’s the part messing me up:

She told me herself that in the last 2–3 weeks she went on a few dates with other guys before me. She kissed two of them on the same day. One of them is literally her housemate — they kissed but made a “boundary” to not do it again even though they still live together. Another guy she had a fight with recently is actually someone I know personally. There was some sexual touching with one of them (not full sex, but still physical intimacy).

She not only told me — she literally showed me the texts between her and that guy while I was sitting with her. She kept saying “idk if I should be telling you this” before she continued.

Meanwhile we haven’t even held each others hands while walking.

Another thing: she had plans to watch a movie with the roommate guy at first — she told me that directly. Then she said no, and ended up meeting me instead. But even before that, she said yes to him once, then canceled, then still met me. That back-and-forth makes me feel like I’m in some rotation I didn’t sign up for.

Today she was maybe planning to go to a movie again. She asked me the ticket price (I get discounts) and then later unsent the message. I don’t know if she wanted to go with me or wanted me to help her get cheaper tickets to go with someone else. That thought alone makes me feel sick.

She’s also on her period and said she gets depressed at home and came back to campus to drink a beer (which I’m assuming was from the roommate guy).

I’m not judging her for having a past — it’s the TIMING and the overlap that’s messing with my head. I feel like I’m emotionally investing in someone who still has one foot in with multiple guys, and she might be gone in a couple months anyway.

At the same time I like her — she’s funny, we get along, she opens up to me emotionally more than to them it seems. And a part of me thinks… if she somehow ended up choosing me, I would want that.

But the other part of me is like:

am I just the “safe emotional guy” while she still entertains other guys physically?

I’m scared of being the guy who invests and then gets replaced.

I’ve even thought about cutting her off before it gets deeper, but I don’t know if that’s the right move or just fear talking.

I don’t have anyone in real life I can talk to about this without feeling judged, so I’m dumping it here.

TL;DR: I like an exchange student who recently dated, kissed, and had some physical stuff with other guys (one is her roommate).

I love him very much. He brings so much light and laughter to my life, and I want our relationship to continue progressing.

One of the big—if not the biggest—issues in our relationship is that he has spine issues that have progressed throughout the course of us being together. Most days he is sedentary and prefers to be home because of his pain, which I understand. He’s been a homebody as long as I’ve known him, though I have been the one to push him to try new things, travel, go out, etc.

I try not to ask for too much because I know he is in pain, and I don’t want to fault him for something he cannot help. However, there are days that I find myself struggling with our relationship. Part of it is due to the chronic pain, which again, I know he can’t help. It feel selfish to even bring up because he is the one physically dealing with it. I try to be in his corner as much as I can.

The other part of it is me wondering if this doesn’t have to do with the chronic pain and is a compatibility issue. I’ve brought this up to him a couple times, where I’ve told him that sometimes I feel like the sole person asking to hang out, asking if he wants to see me, asking if we should go do something. My best friend planned my birthday because he’s “not a planner”. I told him sometimes I’d like to get flowers just because. When I mentioned to him that it would be nice if he reserved a dinner table for us as a surprise sometime, he said, “I don’t make reservations.” From the beginning of us dating, I remember nudging him about planning a date for us because I picked the first few. 

Today was another day where I asked him if he wanted to hang out (I’ve mentioned to him before it would be nice if he asked me sometimes before I asked him bc it felt like it’s always me asking first), and he asked if I wanted to come over. We’ve been inside a lot lately and I told him even if we got coffee first or went for a little before going back inside, it would be nice. He asked me “what do you have in mind”, to which I said that I gave suggestions already, but would love if he gave some options too. His response was that he is limited on what he can do, which I understand, but sometimes it feels like it’s me coming up with the ideas all the time. 

I admitted today that I’m struggling and I need to see a therapist for support. I am in his corner, but I find myself mourning what I thought this relationship would be and wondering if it is an overall compatibility issue that is exacerbated by the chronic pain. I don’t know. I love him very much and I put on a brave face for him, but I don’t know if I’m truly happy. It feels selfish of me to want/ask for more if it is his health condition preventing him from doing all the things that he wants to do. On the other hand, if this is who he is at a person and it is a compatibility issue at heart, I don’t want it to feel like I’m trying to change him. That’s not fair to anyone. 

I guess there are a few questions: do I continue to stay the course without bringing it up or do I have a very real conversation with him about this? I don’t want to make him feel at fault for what he can’t control. I do love him and I do want a future with him, but some days I feel so sad because it feels like I’m doing the most to keep us going. He called me while I was writing this and I started crying all over again. 

TL;DR: I can’t tell if my relationship issues are with my boyfriend’s chronic health conditions or if we are incompatible in a different sense. I don’t know how to broach the subject or if I should at all. ",2,1761610841.0,relationships,4,1.0,False

I am the only girl in the friend group right now however it hasn’t always been that way. People have moved for work, school, etc. but it was more diverse at first. It being a co-ed group has never been an issue as all of our partners are always included and typically get along great with the rest of the group. 

About a year ago our friend Nick(25m) introduced his new girlfriend Emma(24f) and her roomate Molly(25f) to the group. I made sure to make a big effort to include them and make them feel welcome. I went over the top about how excited I was to finally have more girls in the group. I hosted a girls night at my house to do a hear me out cake and had them invite some of their friends as well. Ive invited them out to lunch and coffee and shopping separate from the guys. I even started reading a book series they were into in the efforts of starting a book club. 

The roommate Molly is fantastic. I absolutely love her. She became the DM of our D&D group. She’s really chill and funny and the whole group gets along with her great. She throws jabs and insults back at the guys with the best of them lol. The issue is the girlfriend Emma. She has, and I say this, in the nicest way possible, the personality of a wet noodle. I have never heard her start a conversation about anything other than complaints. She is nearly impossible to have a conversation with. She is also extremely self-centered and doesn’t see how her behavior affects the rest of us. 

Anytime the group goes downtown we will agree on a spot, and she will wait until we are in the cars and on the way downtown before she pitches a fit that she wants to go to the karaoke bar (not downtown) instead. She will insist that if we don’t go where she wants then we need to turn around on the highway and take her back. If we go where she wants, she refuses to go anywhere else for the rest of the night. She does this with restaurants and movies and basically anything else. Right now she is trying to demand that everyone in the group go to a rave for Halloween and that she (and by extension, Nick) will not go out with us for Halloween if we don’t go to a 800+ person rave. 

I don’t know how to say this in a way that doesn’t sound horrible, but Nick is a very unattractive guy and we were all thrilled that he got a pretty girlfriend. She is like so out of his league it’s unbelievable so no one has been willing to say anything against her or stand up to her because we don’t want to ruin Nick’s one chance with a hot girl. 

That being said, I am so over her bullshit. I have reached the point where I want to tell him that no one can stand. His girlfriend and her behavior is disturbing and unacceptable but I hesitate to rock the boat and cause issues within the group. No one has ever had an issue with anyone’s partner before so this is uncharted territory within the group. I’m not sure how to go about this or if I even should.
WIBTA if I said something, and if I should, what do I say?



Also technically not related to the story, but is a good example of how ignorant and annoying she is: 

I was fostering a four month old kitten who she absolutely insisted on adopting. She started the adoption paperwork then dilly dallied for nearly a month before finally coming to pick him up. When she came to get him, she was pissed because I wasn’t sending him home with food, toys a litter box and cat towers, etc. She genuinely thought it was my responsibility to buy those for her. After having him for about a week she told me that he was “at a good size” so she was cutting down his food by half because she didn’t want him to get bigger. She then argued with me (a licensed vet tech) about how she knew better than me, and that feeding a 4 month old kitten less than half of the daily recommended amount wouldn’t cause serious health conditions related to malnutrition it would in fact just keep him small.

**Trust and Corporation**

...

**V**

This brings us to our ‘unincorporated bodies’, and by way of a first example I should like to mention the Wesleyans. They have a very elaborate and a highly centralised constitution, the primary outlines of which are to be found in a deed to which John Wesley set his seal in 1784. Thereby he declared the trusts upon which he was holding certain lands and buildings that had been conveyed to him in various parts of England. Now-a-days we see Wesleyan chapels in all our towns and in many of our villages. Generally every chapel has its separate set of trustees, but the trust deeds all follow one model, devised by a famous lawyer in 1832 – the printed copy that lies before me fills more than forty pages – and these deeds institute a form of government so centralised that Rome might be proud of it, though the central organ is no pope, but a council.

But we must not dwell any longer on cases in which there is a ‘charitable trust’, for, as already said, there is in these cases no pressing demand for a personal destinatory. We can, if we please, think of the charitable *Zweck* as filling the place that is filled by a person in the ordinary private trust. When, however, we leave behind us the province, the wide province, of ‘charity’, then – so we might argue *a priori* –a question about personality must arise. There will here be no *Zweck* that is protected as being ‘beneficial to the public’. There will here be no intervention of a *Staatsanwalt* who represents the ‘father of the country’. Must there not therefore be some destinatory who is either a natural or else a juristic person? Can we have a trust for a *Genossenschaft*, unless it is endowed with personality, or unless it is steadily regarded as being a mere collective name for certain natural persons? I believe that our answer should be that in theory we cannot, but that in practice we can.

If then we ask how there can be this divergence between theory and practice, we come upon what has to my mind been the chief merit of the Trust. It has served to protect the unincorporated *Genossenschaft* against the attacks of inadequate and individualistic theories.

We should all agree that, if an *Anstalt* or a *Genossenschaft* is to live and thrive, it must be efficiently defended by law against external enemies. On the other hand, experience seems to show that it can live and thrive, although the only theories that lawyers hold about its internal affairs are inadequate. Let me dwell for a moment on both of these truths.

Our *Anstalt*, or our *Genossenschaft*, or whatever it may be, has to live in a wicked world: a world full of thieves and rogues and other bad people. And apart from wickedness, there will be unfounded claims to be resisted: claims made by neighbours, claims made by the State. This sensitive being must have a hard, exterior shell. Now our Trust provides this hard, exterior shell for whatever lies within. If there is theft, the thief will be accused of stealing the goods of Mr A. B. and Mr C. D., and not one word will be said of the trust. If there is a dispute about a boundary, Mr A. B. and Mr C. D. will bring or defend the action. It is here to be remembered that during the age in which the Trust was taking shape all this external litigation went on before courts where nothing could be said about trusts. The judges in those courts, if I may so say, could only see the wall of trustees and could see nothing that lay beyond it. Thus in a conflict with an external foe no question about personality could arise. A great deal of ingenuity had been spent in bringing about this result.

But if there be this hard exterior shell, then there is no longer any pressing demand for juristic theory. Years may pass by, decades, even centuries, before jurisprudence is called upon to decide exactly what it is that lies within the shell. And if what lies within is some *Genossenschaft*, it may slowly and silently change its shape many times before it is compelled to explain its constitution to a public tribunal. **Disputes there will be; but the disputants will be very unwilling to call in the policeman. This unwillingness may reach its highest point in the case of religious bodies. Englishmen are a litigious race, and religious people have always plenty to quarrel about. Still they are very reluctant to seek the judgment seat of Gallio. As is well known, our ‘Law Reports’, beginning in the day of Edward I, are a mountainous mass. Almost every side of English life is revealed in them. But if you search them through in the hope of discovering the organisation of our churches and sects (other than the established church) you will find only a few widely scattered hints. And what is true of religious bodies, is hardly less true of many other** *Vereine*, **such as our ‘clubs’. Even the ‘pugnacious Englishman’ whom Ihering admired, would, as we say, think once, twice, thrice, before he appealed to a court of law against the decision of the committee or the general meeting.** I say ‘appealed’, and believe that this is the word that he would use, for the thought of a ‘jurisdiction’ inherent in the *Genossenschaft* is strong in us, and I believe that it is at its strongest where there is no formal corporation. And so, the external wall being kept in good repair, our English legal *Dogmatik* \[dogmatics\] may have no theory or a wholly inadequate and antiquated theory of what goes on behind. And to some of us that seems a desirable state of affairs. Shameful though it may be to say this, we fear the petrifying action of juristic theory.

And now may I name a few typical instances of ‘unincorporated bodies’ that have lived behind the trustee wall?

**I imagine a foreign tourist, with Badeker in hand, visiting one of our ‘Inns of Court’: let us say Lincoln’s Inn. He sees the chapel and the library and the dining-hall; he sees the external gates that are shut at night. It is in many respects much like such colleges as he may see at Oxford and Cambridge. On inquiry he hears of an ancient constitution that had taken shape before 1422, and we know not how much earlier. He learns that something in the way of legal education is being done by these Inns of Court, and that for this purpose a federal organ, a Council of Legal Education, has been established. He learns that no man can practise as an advocate in any of the higher courts who is not a member of one of the four Inns and who has not there received the degree of ‘barrister-at-law’. He would learn that these Inns have been very free to dictate the terms upon which this degree is given. He would learn that the Inn has in its hands a terrible, if rarely exercised, power of expelling (‘disbarring’) a member for dishonourable or unprofessional conduct, of excluding him from the courts in which he has been making his living, of ruining him and disgracing him**. He would learn that in such a case there might be an appeal to the judges of our High Court: but not to them as a public tribunal: to them as ‘visitors’ and as constituting, we might say, a second instance of the domestic forum.

**Well, he might say, apparently we have some curious hybrid – and we must expect such things in England – between an** *Anstalt des offentlichen Rechtes* **\[an institution of public law\] and a** *privilegierte Korporation* **\[privileged corporation\]. Nothing of the sort, an English friend would reply; you have here a** *Privatverein* **\[private society\] which has not even juristic personality. It might – such at least our theory has been – dissolve itself tomorrow, and its members might divide the property that is held for them by trustees. And indeed there was until lately an Inn of a somewhat similar character, the ancient Inn of the ‘Serjeants at Law’, and, as there were to be no more serjeants, its members dissolved the** *Verein* **and divided their property. Many people thought that this dissolution of an ancient society was to be regretted; there was a little war in the newspapers about it; but as to the legal right we were told that there was no doubt.**

**It need hardly be said that the case of these Inns of Court is in a certain sense anomalous. Such powers as they wield could not be acquired at the present day by any Privatverein, and it would not be too much to say that we do not exactly know how or when those powers were acquired, for the beginning of these societies of lawyers was very humble and is very dark. But, before we leave them, let us remember that the English judges who received and repeated a great deal of the canonistic learning about corporations,** *Fiktionstheorie, Konzessionstheorie* **\[fiction theory, concession theory\] and so forth, were to a man members of these** *Korperschaften* **\[corporate entities\] and had never found that the want of juristic personality was a serious misfortune. Our lawyers were rich and influential people. They could easily have obtained incorporation had they desired it. They did not desire it**.

But let us come to modern cases. To-day German ships and Austrian ships are carrying into all the seas the name of the keeper of a coffee-house, the name of Edward Lloyd. At the end of the seventeenth century he kept a coffee-house in the City of London, which was frequented by ‘underwriters’ or marine insurers. Now from 1720 onwards these men had to do their business in the most purely individualistic fashion. In order to protect two privileged corporations, which had lent money to the State, even a simple *Gesellschaft* \[society\] among underwriters was forbidden. Every insurer had to act for himself and for himself only. **We might not expect to see such individualistic units coalescing so as to form a compactly organised body – and this too not in the middle age but in the eighteenth century. However, these men had common interests: an interest in obtaining information, an interest in exposing fraud and resisting fraudulent claims.**

**There was a subscription; there was a small ‘trust fund’; the exclusive use of the ‘coffee-house’ was obtained. The** *Verein* **grew and grew. During the great wars of the Napoleonic age, ‘the Committee for regulating the affairs of Lloyd’s Coffee House’ became a great power. But the organisation was still very loose until 1811, when a trust deed was executed and bore more than eleven hundred signatures. I must not attempt to tell all that ‘Lloyd’s’ has done for England. The story should be the better known in Germany, because the hero of it, J. J. Angerstein, though he came to us from Russia, was of German parentage.** But until 1871 Lloyd’s was an unincorporated *Verein* without the least trace (at least so we said) of juristic personality about it. And when incorporation came in 1871, the chief reason for the change was to be found in no ordinary event, but in the recovery from the bottom of the Zuyder Zee of a large mass of treasure which had been lying there since 1799, and which belonged – well, owing to the destruction of records by an accidental fire, no one could exactly say to whom it belonged. In the life of such a *Verein* ‘incorporation’ appears as a mere event. We could not even compare it to the attainment of full age. Rather it is as if a ‘natural person’ bought a type-writing machine or took lessons in stenography.

**Even more instructive is the story of the London Stock Exchange. Here also we see small beginnings. In the eighteenth century the men who deal in stocks frequent certain coffee-houses: in particular ‘Jonathan’s’. They begin to form a club. They pay the owner an annual sum to exclude those whom they have not elected into their society. In 1773 they moved to more commodious rooms. Those who used the rooms paid sixpence a day. In 1802 a costly site was bought, a costly building erected, and an elaborate constitution was formulated in a ‘deed of settlement’. There was a capital of £20,000 divided into 400 shares. Behind the trustees stood a body of ‘proprietors’, who had found the money; and behind the ‘proprietors’ stood a much larger body of ‘members’, whose subscriptions formed the income that was divided among the ‘proprietors’. And then there was building and always more building. In 1876 there was a new ‘deed of settlement’; in 1882 large changes were made in it; there was a capital of £240,000 divided into 20,000 shares.**

Into details we must not enter. Suffice it that the organisation is of a high type. It might, for example, strike one at first that the shares of the ‘proprietors’ would, by the natural operation of private law, be often passing into the hands of people who were in no wise interested in the sort of business that is done on the Stock Exchange, and that thus the *genossenschaftliche* \[co-operative\] character of the constitution would be destroyed. But that danger could be obviated. There was nothing to prevent the original subscribers from agreeing that the shares could only be sold to members of the Stock Exchange, and that, if by inheritance a share came to other hands, it must be sold within a twelvemonth. Such regulations have not prevented the shares from being valuable.

In 1877 a Royal Commission was appointed to consider the Stock Exchange. It heard evidence; it issued a report; it made recommendations. A majority of its members recommended that the Stock Exchange should be incorporated by royal charter or Act of Parliament.

And so the Stock Exchange was incorporated? Certainly not. In England you cannot incorporate people who do not want incorporation, and the members of the Stock Exchange did not want it. Something had been said about the submission of the ‘bye-laws’ of the corporation to the approval of a central *Behorde* \[authority\] the Board of Trade. That was the cloven hoof. *Ex pede diabolum*.

Now, unless we have regard to what an Englishman would call ‘mere technicalities’, it would not, I think, be easy to find anything that a corporation could do and that is not being done by this *nicht rechtsfahiger Verein* \[society without legal capacity\]. It legislates profusely. Its representative among the Royal Commissioners did not scruple to speak of ‘legislation’. And then he told how it did justice and enforced a higher standard of morality than the law can reach. And a terrible justice it is. Expulsion brings with it disgrace and ruin, and minor punishments are inflicted. In current language the committee is said to ‘pronounce a sentence’ of suspension for a year, or two years or five years.

The ‘quasi-judicial’ power of the body over its members – *quasi* is one of the few Latin words that English lawyers really love – is made to look all the more judicial by the manner in which it is treated by our courts of law. A man who is expelled from one of our clubs – or (to use a delicate phrase) whose name is removed from the list of members – will sometimes complain to a public court. That court will insist on a strict observance of any procedure that is formulated in the written or printed ‘rules’ of the club; but also there may be talk of ‘natural justice’. Thereby is meant an observance of those forms which should secure for every accused person a full and fair trail. In particular, a definite accusation should be definitely made, and the accused should have a sufficient opportunity of meeting it. Whatever the printed rules may say, it is not easy to be supposed that a man has placed his rights beyond that protection which should be afforded to all men by ‘natural justice’. Theoretically the ‘rules’, written or unwritten, may only be the terms of a contract, still the thought that this man is complaining that justice has been denied to him by those who were bound to do it, often finds practical expression. The dread of *Vereinsherrschaft* \[club-rule\] is hardly represented among us.

I believe that in the eyes of a large number of my fellow-countrymen the most important and august tribunal in England is not the House of Lords but the Jockey Club; and in this case we might see ‘jurisdiction’ – they would use that word – exercised by the *Verein* over those who stand outside it. I must not aspire to tell this story. But the beginning of it seems to be that some gentlemen form a club, buy a race-course, the famous Newmarket Heath, which is conveyed to trustees for them, and then they can say who shall and who shall not be admitted to it. I fancy, however, that some men who have been excluded from this sacred heath (‘warned off Newmarket Heath’ is our phrase) would have much preferred the major excommunication of that ‘historic organism’ the Church of Rome.

**It will have been observed that I have been choosing examples from the eighteenth century: a time when, if I am not mistaken, corporation theory sat heavy upon mankind in other countries. And we had a theory in England too, and it was of a very orthodox pattern; but it did not crush the spirit of association. So much could be done behind a trust, and the beginnings might be so very humble. All this tended to make our English jurisprudence disorderly, but also gave to it something of the character of an experimental science, and that I hope it will never lose**. But surely, it will be said, you must have some juristic theory about the constitution of the *Privatverein*: **some theory, for example, about your clubs and those luxurious club-houses which we see in Pall Mall. Yes, we have, and it is a purely individualistic theory. This it must necessarily be. As there is no ‘charity’ in the case, the trust must be a trust for persons, and any attempt to make it a trust for unascertained persons (future members) would soon come into collision with that ‘rule against perpetuities’ which keeps the** *Familienfideicommiss* \[family *fideicommissum*; entailed estate\] **within moderate bounds**. So really we have no tools to work with except such as are well known to all lawyers. Behind the wall of trustees we have *Miteigentum* and *Vertrag* \[co-ownership and contract\]. We say that ‘in equity’ the original members were the only destinatories: they were *Miteigentumer* with *Gesamthandschaft* \[co-owners with joint ownership\]; but at the same time they contracted to observe certain rules.

I do not think that the result is satisfactory. **The ‘ownership in equity’ that the member of the club has in land, buildings, furniture, books etc. is of a very strange kind. (1) Practically it is inalienable. (2) Practically his creditors cannot touch it by execution. (3) Practically, if he is bankrupt, there is nothing for them. (4) It ceases if he does not pay his annual subscription. (5) It ceases if in accordance with the rules he is expelled. (6) His share – if of a share we may speak – is diminished whenever a new member is elected. (7) He cannot demand a partition. And (8) in order to explain all this, we have to suppose numerous tacit contracts which no one knows that he is making, for after every election there must be a fresh contract between the new member and all the old members.** But every judge on the bench is a member of at least one club, and we know that, if a thousand tacit contracts have to be discovered, a tolerable result will be attained. **We may remember that the State did not fall to pieces when philosophers and jurists declared that it was the outcome of contract.**

**There are some signs that in course of time we may be driven out of this theory. The State has begun to tax clubs as it taxes corporations. When we have laid down as a very general principle that, when a man gains any property upon the death of another, he must pay something to the State, it becomes plain to us that the property of a club will escape this sort of taxation. It would be ridiculous, and indeed impossible, to hold that, whenever a member of a club dies, some taxable increment of wealth accrues to every one of his fellows. So the property of the ‘unincorporated body’ is to be taxed as if it belonged to a corporation. This is a step forward.**

Strange operations with *Miteigentum* and *Vertrag* must, I should suppose, have been very familiar to German jurists in days when corporateness was not to be had upon easy terms. But what I am concerned to remark is that, owing to the hard exterior shell provided by a trust, the inadequacy of our theories was seldom brought to the light of day. Every now and again a court of law may have a word to say about a club; but you will find nothing about club-property in our institutional treatises. And yet the value of those houses in London, their sites and their contents, is very great, and almost every English lawyer is interested, personally interested, in one of them.

A comparison between our unincorporated *Verein* and the *nicht rechtsfahiger Verein* \[society without legal capacity\] of the new German code might be very instructive; but perhaps the first difference that would strike anyone who undertook the task would be this, that, whereas in the German case almost every conceivable question has been forestalled by scientific and controversial discussion, there is in the English case very little to be read. We have a few decisions, dotted about here and there; but they have to be read with caution, for each decision deals only with some one type of *Verein*, and the types are endless. I might perhaps say that no attempt has been made to provide answers for half the questions that have been raised, for example, by Dr Gierke. And yet let me repeat that our *Vereine ohne Rechtsfahigkeit* \[societies without legal capacity\] are very numerous, that some of them are already old, and that some of them are wealthy.

One of the points that is clear (and here we differ from the German code) is that our unincorporated *Verein* is not to be likened to a *Gesellschaft* (partnership): at all events this is not to be done when the *Verein* is a ‘club’ of the common type. **Parenthetically I may observe that for the present purpose the English for Gesellschaft is ‘Partnership’ and the English for Verein is ‘Society’. Now in the early days of clubs an attempt was made to treat the club as a Gesellschaft. The Gesellschaft was an old well established institute, and an effort was made to bring the new creature under the old rubric. That effort has, however, been definitely abandoned and we are now taught, not only that the club is not a Gesellschaft, but that you cannot as a general rule argue from the one to the other. Since 1890 we have a statutory definition of a Gesellschaft : — “Partnership is the relation which subsists between persons carrying on a business in common with a view of profit”. A club would not fall within this definition.**

**The chief practical interest of this doctrine, that a club is not to be assimilated to a Gesellschaft, lies in the fact that the committee of an English club has no general power of contracting on behalf of the members within a sphere marked out by the affairs of the club. A true corporate liability could not be manufactured, and, as I shall remark below, our courts were setting their faces against any attempt to establish a limited liability. The supposition as regards the club is that the members pay their subscriptions in advance, and that the committee has ready money to meet all current expenses. On paper that is not satisfactory. I believe that cases must pretty frequently occur in which a tradesman who has supplied wine or books or other goods for the use of the club would have great difficulty in discovering the other contractor. We have no such rule (and here again we differ from the German code) as that the person who professes to act on behalf of an unincorporated** *Verein* **is always personally liable’; and I think the tradesman could often be forced to admit that he had not given credit to any man, the truth being that he thought of the club as a person.** I can only say that scandals, though not absolutely unknown have been very rare; that the members of the club would in all probability treat the case as if it were one of corporate liability; and that London tradesmen are willing enough to supply goods to clubs on a large scale. If there is to be extraordinary expenditure, if, for example, a new wing is to be added to the building, money to a large amount can often be borrowed at a very moderate rate of interest. We know a “mortgage without personal liability”; and that has been useful. Strictly speaking there is no debtor; but the creditor has various ways by which he can obtain payment : in particular he can sell the land.

*Deliktsfdhigkeit* is an interesting and at the present time it is perhaps a burning point. A little while ago English lawyers would probably have denied that anything resembling corporate liability could be established in this quarter. Any liability beyond that of the man who does the unlawful act must be that of a principal for the acts of an agent, or of a master for the acts of a servant, and if there is any liability at all, it must be unlimited. **But this is now very doubtful. Our highest court (the House of Lords) has lately held that a trade union is** *deliktsfdhig*: **in other words, that the damage done by the organized action of this unincorporated** *Verein* **must be paid for out of the property held by its trustees. Now a trade union is an unincorporated Verein of a somewhat exceptional sort. It is the subject of special Statutes which have conferred upon it some, but not all, of those legal qualities which we associate with incorporation. Whether this decision, which made a great noise, is attributable to this exceptional element, or whether it is to be based upon a broader ground, is not absolutely plain. The trade unionists are dissatisfied about this and some other matters, and what the results of their agitation will be I cannot say. The one thing that it is safe to predict is that in England socialpolitische will take precedence of rechtswissenschaftliche considerations.** As to the broader question, now that a beginning has once been made, I believe that the situation could be well described in some words that I will borrow from Dr Gierke:

* Perhaps a custom is taking root subjecting clubs without legal capacity to corporation law as far as liability for unlawfully inflicted damage is concerned.

The natural inclination of the members of an English club would, so I think, be to treat the case exactly as if it were a case of corporate liability. It has often struck me that morally there is most personality where legally there is none. A man thinks of his club as a living being, honourable as well as honest, while the joint-stock company is only a sort of machine into which he puts money and out of which he draws dividends.

As to the *Deliktsfdhigkeit* of corporations it may not be out of place to observe that by this time English corporations have had to pay for almost every kind of wrong that one man can do to another. **Thus recently an incorporated company had to pay for having instituted criminal proceedings against a man “maliciously and without reasonable or probable cause.” In our theoretical moments we reconcile this with the** *Fiktionstheorie* **by saying that it is a case in which a master** (*persona ficta*) **pays for the act of his servant or a principal for the act of an agent, and, as our rule about the master’s liability is very wide, the explanation is not obviously insufficient. I am not sure that this may not help us to attain the desirable result in the case of the unincorporated Verein.**

Our practical doctrine about the *Vermogen* of our clubs seems to me to be very much that which is stated by Dr Gierke in the following sentence, though (for the reason already given) we should have to omit a few words in which he refers to a *Geselhckaft* \[partnership\].

* The club’s property... belongs... to the members for the time being; but as partnership-property \[club-property\] it is a separate body of assets set aside from the remaining property of the members as property serving the purpose of the partnership \[club\], to be held in common by the partners \[club-members\] in undivided shares, which comes close to a corporation’s property.

And then in England the *Sonderung* \[separation\] of this *Vermogen* from all the other *Vermogen* of the *Teilhaber* \[members\] can be all the plainer, because in legal analysis the owners of this *Vermogen* are not the *Vereinsmitglieder* \[club members\], but the trustees. It is true that for practical purposes this property of the trustees of a club may be hardly better than a *Scheineigentum* \[sham property\], and the trustees themselves may be hardly better than puppets whose wires are pulled by the committee and the general meeting. And it is to be observed that in the case of this class of trusts the destinatories are peculiarly well protected, for, even if deeds were forged, no man could say that he had bought one of our club-houses or a catholic cathedral without suspecting the existence of a trust: *res ipsa loquitur* \[the matter speaks for itself\]. Still the *nudum dominium* \[bare proprietary right\] of the trustees serves as a sort of external mark which keeps all this *Vermogen* together as a *Sondervermogen* \[separate body of assets\]. **And when we remember that some great jurists have found it possible to speak of the juristic person as puppet, a not unimportant analogy is established.**

* The club can acquire property not merely from living persons but also by succession to dead persons. For there is no obstacle to nominating the members at any given time in their partnership (club) solidarity as heirs, nor to making them a bequest.

This is substantially true of our English law, though the words ‘nominating as heirs’ do not fit into our system. A little care on the part of the testator is requisite in such cases in order that he may not be accused of having endeavoured to create a trust in favour of a long series of unascertained persons (future members) and of having come into collision with our ‘rule against perpetuities’. The less he says the better. Substantially the *Verein* is *vermachtnissfahig* \[able to receive bequests\]. Dr Gierke’s next sentence also is true, though of course the first word is inappropriate. ‘\[Laws of the federal states introducing (*landesgesetzlich*)\] restrictions on the abilities of juristic persons to acquire rights cannot be extended to clubs having no legal capacity’.

**Since our lawyers explained away a certain statute of Henry VIII, which will be mentioned below, our** *nicht rechtsfahiger Verein* **\[society without legal capacity\] has stood outside the scope of those statutes which forbad corporations to acquire land (Statutes of Mortmain).** And this was at one time a great advantage that our *nicht rechtsfahiger Verein* had over the *rechtsfahiger Verein*. **The Jockey Club, for example, could acquire Newmarket Heath without asking the King’s or the State’s permission. Even at the present day certain of our** *nicht rechtsfahige Vereine* **would lose their power of holding an unlimited quantity of land if they registered themselves under the Companies Acts and so became corporations.**

As regards *Prozessfahigkeit*, our doctrine regarded the capacity ‘to sue and be sued’ as one of the essential attributes of the corporation. Indeed at times this capacity seems to have appeared as the specific differentia of the corporation, though the common seal also was an important mark. And with this doctrine we have not openly broken. It will be understood, however, that in a very large class of disputes the concerns of the *nicht rechtsfahiger Verein* would be completely represented by the trustees. Especially would this be the case in all litigation concerning *Liegenschaft* \[immovables\]. Suppose a dispute with a neighbour about a servitude (‘easement’) or about a boundary, this can be brought into court and decided as if there were no trust in existence and no *Verein*. And so if the dispute is with some *Pachter* \[leaseholder\] or *Mieter* \[tenant\] of land or houses that belong ‘in equity’ to the *Verein*. There is a legal relationship between him and the trustees, but none between him and the *Verein*; and in general it will be impossible for him to give trouble by any talk about the constitution of the *Verein*. And then as regards internal controversies, the Court of Chancery developed a highly elastic doctrine about ‘representative suits’. The beginning of this lies far away from the point that we are considering. It must suffice that in dealing with those complicated trusts that Englishmen are allowed to create, the court was driven to hold that a class of persons may be sufficiently represented in litigation by a member of that class. We became familiar with the plaintiff who was suing ‘on behalf of himself and all other legatees’ or ‘all other cousins of the deceased’ or ‘all other creditors’. This practice came to the aid of the *Verein*. Our English tendency would be to argue that if in many cases a mere class (e.g. the testator’s nephews) could be represented by a specimen, then *a fortiori* a *Verein* could be represented by its ‘officers’. And we should do this without seeing that we were infringing the corporation’s exclusive possession of *Prozessfahigkeit*.

1ohv3a1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShopeePH/comments/1ohv3a1/shopee_warnings_and_fyis/,Shopee Warnings and FYIs,"I’m sharing this to warn others and provide a roadmap if you’re fighting a similar scam on Shopee.

THE SCAM:
	•	Ordered: 4 Baofeng walkie-talkies from seller “Kiyano” (Shopee “Preferred Seller”)
	•	Amount Paid: ₱1,210
	•	Received: A single roll of pink trash bag
	
RED FLAGS:
	•	“Preferred Seller” badge means NOTHING - Shopee doesn’t verify properly
	•	Seller deliberately sends lightweight junk to show “delivered” status
	•	Classic scam: get delivery confirmation while keeping your money

HOW I FOUGHT BACK (AND WON):

	1.	Documented EVERYTHING
	•	Took photos of sealed package with shipping label visible
	•	Recorded video of unboxing process
	•	Took size comparison photos with everyday objects
	•	Screenshot the original product listing

	2.	Filed Shopee Dispute Immediately
	•	Selected “Item does not match description”
	•	Uploaded ALL evidence (photos + videos)
	•	Keep under 10MB for photos, 30MB for videos

	3.	Escalated to Government Agencies
	•	DTI Consumer Protection: Filed online at consumercare.dti.gov.ph
	•	PNP Anti-Cybercrime Group: Formal complaint
	•	NBI Anti-Fraud Division: Additional complaint
	•	These government complaints add serious pressure!

	4.	Sent Strategic Follow-Up Messages
	•	Sent messages via ‘Discuss With Seller’ and ‘Help Center’ open cases 
	•	Referenced my Platinum status and purchase history (118 orders, ₱53k+ this year + ₱65k+ iPhone Pro)
	•	Mentioned government complaints in every email
	•	Professional but firm tone - no cursing, no guilt-tripping, just facts

	5.	Applied Economic Pressure
	•	Emptied my 85-item shopping cart
	•	Moved purchases to competitors (even at higher prices)
	•	Made it clear they were losing a high-value customer

TIMELINE:
	•	Evidence submitted: October 16
	•	Shopee’s deadline: October 18, 09:37
	•	Their actual response: October 27 (11 days late!)
	•	Refund approved: Finally processed after persistent follow-ups on October 27

RESULT:
✅ Got full ₱1,210 refund
✅ Withdrew money to e-wallet immediately
✅ Deleted my Shopee account permanently
✅ Moved to a competitor

KEY LESSONS:
	1.	Verify contents before clicking “Order Received.” Once confirmed, disputes are harder.
	2.	Video everything. Film yourself opening the package with the shipping label visible. This is your best evidence.
	3.	Don’t trust seller badges. “Preferred Seller,” “Mall,” whatever - scammers exist everywhere.
	4.	Escalate to DTI immediately. Shopee responds when government agencies are involved. DTI case numbers carry weight.
	5.	Be persistent but professional. Send follow-ups daily. Reference your case number, evidence, and government complaints.
	6.	Vote with your wallet. I was a Platinum member (₱200k+ lifetime spend) and they still tried to protect the scammer. I deleted my account. Platforms need to learn customer loyalty matters.
	7.	NEVER GIVE UP. They hope you’ll get tired and move on. Don’t. Fight for principle, not just the money.

AVOID THESE SELLERS:
	•	Kiyano (sent trash bags)
	•	FOODMAK.PH (sent hardened, unusable coffee - separate issue)

BOTTOM LINE:
You CAN win against scammers, but you need evidence, persistence, and willingness to escalate. Shopee’s buyer protection only works if you PUSH for it. Don’t let them wear you down.

Stay safe out there, and always document your deliveries! ",1,1761610419.0,ShopeePH,0,1.0,False

Not very familiar with American dating culture, need advice.","I met the guy on Hinge last year and went for a coffee. I was in a doctoral program, and he was a professor at the same university. It seems everything went well, and I felt a spark. He seemed to want to continue going somewhere, but I just said I had to go home and had something to do. Before we met, he also asked for my number, but I didn't give it to him as I said I would like to just meet him in person first, and if it goes well, we could exchange numbers. After I got home, we didn't text each other. The next morning, I received his message on Hinge to say Hope you have a great day. I didn't respond immediately. A couple of hours later, he disappeared on the app. It seemed he had unmatched me.

I was confused but felt it's ok as we only met once. I am introverted and sometimes gave others the impression I was sort of cold or not interested. I don't know if he thought that way, as he is a professor in higher ed, and I felt he had a big ego.

Then this year, I graduated with a PhD and have stayed at the university for my internship. That guy sent me a like and a message on Hinge with a new profile, and said congrats, we met last year. He was busy and stressed, so he dropped the ball. He asked me if I wanted another try. He sent a genuine apology and said there's no reason for him to be a shithead, but he was doing the best to improve, etc. So I rematched him since I did feel connected with him last year, which I barely had when I met others from the App.

Then we went to dinner. When we walked, he asked me if I wanted to grab his arm. I did and took it as a romantic gesture. But when I asked him if he offered this to any girl from the apps, no matter if he was interested in them or not. He said yes, it's just being polite. Actually, it turned me a bit off. Then we sat and talked, and he started to initiate some physical touches, like putting his hand on my legs or holding my waist. I don't know if he did that because I grabbed his arms when we were walking. I felt a bit uncomfortable, but I understood the physical touches in the first couple of dates were still normal. I didn't reject, but didn't interact with it either. Until the very last minutes, he walked me to my car, and I felt his hand was close to my butt (not touching it), but a bit close to it. I immediately moved his hand to a higher position and asked him what you are doing! It seemed he was a bit embarrassed or surprised, but without an apology. After that, we had a short and distant hug. He said to text me after you drive home safely.

I did text him I got home, it was fun to talk to you. He said he had a great time, thanks for coming. I said me too, good night. It's been two days since then we never texted each other again. I am still interested in this guy, as there is a lot in common. He does look for a long term as he is not very young. But there are a lot of mixed signals, and I don't know what's going on right now. Does that mean he is no longer interested in it after I rejected the physical touch? Or he just felt I was no longer interested in it since he realized he crossed the line, and his ego led him to stop reaching out. I don't want to chase a guy, although I am interested in him, but I want to figure out what's going on and what to do. Is his action normal? I am from a different culture, and I don't know.

* **Budget is $3,000-$3,200 with utilities** (can comfortably afford up to $3,500, but 3.2 would be ideal - unless something REALLY stands out and the value is worth it)
* Safe community - no break ins, packages stolen, having close by grocery stores, Costco, coffee shops, etc. is a plus
* In-unit washer/dryer
* Amenities would be a plus - mainly gym
* I own a car so factoring in parking cover, if needed, into the budget as well
* I have a furry baby (small-mid sz chihuahua terrier) as well :)

Two sugars, a splash of milk, just the way she liked it. He kissed her forehead, whispered something sweet, and slipped out before she stirred. He always promised he’d be back before dark.

For months, he had been seeing someone else.

It started small, an innocent visit, a moment of curiosity. But soon, Daniel was sneaking out at odd hours, claiming late shifts or errands that never quite added up. His partner, Lily, noticed. She said nothing at first, but her smile began to waver, her eyes shadowed with quiet dread.

She tried to tell herself she was imagining things. Daniel was a good man, attentive and kind. He still brought her flowers, still left notes tucked in drawers and under pillows: You are my heart. But some nights, she’d wake to find his side of the bed cold.

Once, she followed him.

Through the fog-draped streets, she trailed him past the bakery, past the iron gates of the cemetery, until he disappeared behind the old chapel doors. She waited for hours, trembling, until he emerged pale and shaking, the dawn bleeding gray around him.

When she confronted him, he didn’t deny it.

“I had to,” he whispered, taking her hands. “I can’t let her have me.”

Lily thought he meant another woman. The confession broke her. She screamed, threw his notes into the fire, and begged him to stop lying. But Daniel only held her tighter. “You don’t understand,” he said. “She comes for me every night. I have to keep her waiting.”

That night, Lily found the other woman.

She came with the wind, a tall figure draped in black, her eyes empty as winter sky. She stood at the end of their bed, patient, inevitable. Lily felt the air grow still, heavy with cold. Daniel sat up, trembling.

“Please,” he said, voice cracking. “Not yet. Not tonight.”

The figure tilted her head, her pale lips curling into something like pity.

“You’ve cheated me long enough,” she said, her voice the hush of graves. “It’s time.”

Lily reached for Daniel, but his hand was already falling away, his breath leaving with hers. And when she looked again, the woman in black was gone, and so was he.

Only the faint scent of lilies remained, and a note on the nightstand that read, I love you. I’ll see you soon.",1,1761610214.0,shortscarystories,0,0.67,False

I recently asked him out for coffee and we talked for like an hour.

I have a friend let's call him (Jeff). I haven't talked to Jeff in almost 2 years but decided to hit him up at the blue to see how it was. We got to talking and we were just talking about our lives and what we've been through and how life is going. I made a suggestion of us meeting to get coffee and continuing talking. He informed me that he had a partner now he had a girlfriend and she lives with him. 
  So I said okay well what she like. Disclaimer my friend is a very open-minded sexual person.  my friend enjoys being pegged by a woman. He loves having his  anal played by a woman. And on top of that he enjoys being submissive. 
   Well he informs me that he really likes his girlfriend she lives with him but she's really uncomfortable with him liking being pegged and him being submissive. He says that they open the relationship up so that he can get what he needed. He does say that she is also open-minded sexually. But it's more so she likes threesomes with other men and she's not interested in women. So most of the threesomes that they have include men men and then her. 
   How I look at it is he's not really getting what he needs sexually in the relationship. But it's more so what she wants and what she needs. And I just don't think that he sees that. So I guess my question is should I explain this to him or not? And then can somebody explain to me why he doesn't see that he's not getting what he needs out of this relationship but she's getting what she wants?

That's where Goodwill comes in. I see Irish coffee mugs there all the time and of course the price is appropriate for what I can/want to pay, but I just have no clue if they're tempered and can withstand the fire that Spanish Coffees traditionally use.

I've made them before in mugs heated beforehand with boiling water and just skipped the fire component, but for a group of guests I'd prefer the showmanship, so does anyone know a trick to determine if a glass is tempered, or if those kinds of glasses are reliably tempered and I can skip a test altogether?",1,1761609570.0,cocktails,0,1.0,False

I'm looking to move out for the first time in my life in about 3-4 months (around mid-end of February 2026). I'm currently residing in South SJ and looking to move up North due to work relocating to Hillsborough and just finally having a place of my own! I'm looking for a **1B1Ba apartment**:

* Currently looking at North/West SJ, Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, and Mountain View (pretty much staying in Santa Clara County. SM County is really pricey...) - really liking Santa Clara due to cheaper utilities
* **Budget is $3,000-$3,200 with utilities** (can comfortably afford up to $3,500, but 3.2 would be ideal - unless something REALLY stands out and the value is worth it)
* Safe community - no break ins, packages stolen, having close by grocery stores, Costco, coffee shops, etc. is a plus
* In-unit washer/dryer
* Amenities would be a plus - mainly gym
* I own a car so factoring in parking cover, if needed, into the budget as well
* I have a furry baby (small-mid sz chihuahua terrier) as well :)

After conducting research I have these spots saved (will tour, but haven't gotten the chance yet) and if you have any experience with any of these places I'd love to hear from you as well!

* Brookside Park in Mountain View
* The Fay in San Jose
* Tuscany Apartments in Santa Clara

I started seeing people here talk about the mental side effects — things like *brain fog,* and didn’t understand what they meant. I felt fine… or at least, I thought I did.

My first real insight came when I started experimenting with **intermittent fasting**. Because of that, I wasn’t taking my Trikafta at the usual 12-hour interval. I ended up with a shorter window between doses. Unexpectedly, I noticed that my **mornings felt amazing** — I was full of motivation, clarity, and drive. I loved that feeling so much that I kept that new schedule, assuming it was because of fasting.

But there was another side to it: by the evening, after taking the blue pill, I would crash.  
I mean *completely*.  
By 8 PM, I couldn’t keep my eyes open.

Now, looking back, here’s what I think was happening:  
With the two doses being too close together, I was basically **overloaded with Trikafta**. That evening “crash” was probably an exaggerated version of its side effects — extreme lethargy, no motivation, nothing left but the urge to sleep.

Okay, so that explains the night dose. But what about the *morning* one?

I started to notice that the amazing motivation I had early in the morning — before my first dose — disappeared right after taking it. By the afternoon, I felt flat. No emotions, no creativity, no drive. Just this numb, robotic state.  
It honestly felt like being a zombie, but I didn’t realize it until recently.

About a week ago, I finally decided to see what life would be like **without Trikafta**.  
I realized that I had been taking the medication so religiously, for so long, that I had come to accept that “foggy” version of myself as normal — even as “me.” But it wasn’t.

When I was still taking it, my mornings were sacred. They were the only hours when I felt truly alive — when Trikafta levels were low in my system. I would drink coffee, read, study, or watch something that deeply mattered to me. Those were my 4 hours of freedom every day.

Now, without it, that sense of freedom lasts all day.  
I feel like I got my personality back.  
My brain is mine again.  
And honestly… I don’t think I could ever go back.",3,1761609359.0,CysticFibrosis,22,0.62,False

She's been married to her husband, say Tom, 38M, for 8 years, and they've got two little kids. Solid family vibe, or so it seemed. Then boom – last week, Tom gets canned from his job for sexual harassment.

From what Jess told my buddy, Tom admitted he was flirting with this coworker who's not his direct report but lower on the ladder. He swears she started it at work, but then he hunted her down on Facebook and started DMing her. Things escalated enough that she showed the messages to HR, and he got the boot. He deleted everything before Jess could see, but he let slip he asked for a ""clothed pic"" from her. Jess is gutted – like, how do you even process that?

It's not the first time, either. She caught flirty texts from him to at least one other woman before, nothing super explicit but definitely crossing lines. Jess works part-time, so ditching him means scrambling for a full-time gig too, plus they've got no other place to crash right now – stuck living together at least till he lands something new.

My buddy's worried sick for her. He says she's flip-flopping: Stick it out, maybe couples therapy to move past it? Or is this the dealbreaker that screams ""leave while you can, for the kids' sake""? She loves him deep down, but trust is shattered. I told him to nudge her toward talking to a lawyer quietly, just to know her options.

What do you all think – red flag city, or room for forgiveness if he owns it? How would you bring this up without blowing up the house? She's tough but hurting bad.

Appreciate any real talk – helping from the sidelines feels helpless sometimes.

TL;DR: Buddy's sister (37F) learned hubby (38M) fired for workplace flirting/DMs with coworker after 8 years married, two kids. Past flirty texts too. Stay and fix, or bail? Complicated by jobs/living setup.

Tyske Ludder - Bringt euch um \[PSAUX Jazz of Death Edit\]

Trivia: PSAUX is actually S.i.h, producer with Tyske Ludder, so this is one kind of an insider remix disguised as an edit.

Lyrics: DE, english below --------vvvvvvv--------------------

ALBERTX:   
Schwarze Seele, schwarze Party, schwarzes Glück  
Schwarzer DJ, schwarze Scheiben Stück für Stück  
Schwarze Lippen, Schwarze Küsse, Schwarzer Tee  
Schwarzes Herz und schwarze Seele und Kaffee  
  
Drachenzwerge, schwarzes Auge nur ein Ring  
Schwarzer Wein und schwarze Gräber Schmetterling  
Schwarzer Lack und schwarzer Latex Sexappeal  
Reiterstiefel Uniform und Wehrmachtspiel

  
PSAUX + ALBERTX:  
Bringt euch um + wenn das schon alles ist  
Bringt euch um + wenn das schon alles ist  
Bringt euch um + wenn’s wirklich alles ist  
Bringt euch um + zeigt uns dass ihr lebt

ALBERTX:  
Schwarzer Stollen, schwarze Arbeit, Katzengold  
Schwarzer Peter, schwarze Kassen abgeholt  
Schwarzer Stahl am Ostseegrund ist erste Wahl  
Kauf platziert, die Presserüge auch egal

Schwarzer Hut und Sonnenbrille, schwarzer Block  
Reizgasnebel, schwarze Schafe und kein Bock  
Morgens, abends, schwarze Milch und gold‘nes Haar  
Selfie vor dem Opferdenkmal - wunderbar

PSAUX + ALBERTX:  
Bringt euch um + wenn das schon alles ist  
Bringt euch um + wenn das schon alles ist  
Bringt euch um + wenn’s wirklich alles ist  
Bringt euch um + zeigt uns dass ihr lebt

LYRICS ENGLISH--------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Disclaimer: this is an ironical song.

ALBERTX:   
Black soul, black party, black luck  
Black DJ, black records piece by piece  
Black lips, black kisses, black tea  
Black heart and black soul and coffee

Dragon dwarves, black eye just a ring  
Black wine and black graves Butterfly  
Black lacquer and black latex Sex appeal  
Riding boots, uniform, and Wehrmacht game  
  
PSAUX + ALBERTX:  
Kill yourselves + if that's all there is  
Kill yourselves + if that's all there is  
Kill yourselves + if that's really all there is  
Kill yourselves + show us that you're alive

ALBERTX:  
Black tunnel, black labor, fool's gold  
Black Peter, black cash registers collected  
Black steel at the bottom of the Baltic Sea is the first choice  
Purchase placed, the press release doesn't matter either

Black hat and sunglasses, black block  
Tear gas fog, black sheep and no desire  
Morning, evening, black milk and golden hair  
Selfie in front of the memorial - wonderful

PSAUX + ALBERTX:  
Kill yourselves + if that's all there is  
Kill yourselves + if that's all there is  
Kill yourselves + if that's really all there is  
Kill yourselves + show us that you're alive

I have a delonghi La specialista maestro EC9665M, bought in 2021

Recently we have noticed there is leaking around the portafilter when brewing.  I bought a few gasket rings to replace and made sure it was flush and everything installed correctly.  It still leaks at the back end of the portafilter, during mid brew and a few minutes afterwards.

I have checked to make sure there were no cracks in the gasket apparatus. I adjusted my grinds multiple times with no success.

The gaskets I bought are after market but I’ve compared them w my old stock and it is essentially the same

I run a de-scale and clean the coffee outlet monthly.

Anyone have any thoughts on how to troubleshoot?

Thanks in advance!",1,1761608629.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I’m a 43 year old male I’ve been all my labs were perfect testosterone in the low 700s. I’ve lost 50 lbs in the 5 years through dieting still no improvement.  Had a sleep study no sleep apnea I do body weight exercise every other day. I posted in another group most of the responses were sleep apnea and I needed trt and one of the replies were to take creatinine so I tried it. Probably after the second day of taking creatinine I have so much more energy I didn’t need coffee in the afternoon noon to stay awake. I have a lot more motivation to do things and my mood has improved very noticeably. Anyone have any ideas why creatinine did all this ?,15,1761608504.0,Biohackers,13,0.94,False

Or do you only use it to help you sleep??,"I’ve recently found out that there is a name for something I’ve been doing since I was a teen(14ish). I have a current Paracosm that has been ongoing for 3 years since I read a book, fell in love with it, hyper focused on it (i have ADHD lol) and then created a “fan-fiction” from it. I slowly began to alter things and it’s now a damn near new story…honestly a new collection of stories! With detailed timelines, added characters and alternate choices and scenarios. I’m the Main Character female lead. However, i sometimes focus on my side characters lives like a fly on the wall that only i and not my Main Character can see unless she needs to for the story. i keep everything in a binder. When there is nothing important that needs to be done, I am enjoying it and playing it out in my mind. My other awesome life with awesome people, experiences and magic! I spend time: 

- Imagining and writing down character bios, scenarios, convos and new backstory that has reveals itself. Alt life choices, s*x scenes, and future and past events from my preferred(home) time-period in their lives.
-World building. I draw maps, Documents,etc. I am apart of world building groups on Reddit as well. I am working on a religion/spirituality with little magical properties that spill over into their physical reality.
-I have a Pinterest board for pretty much EVERYTHING in my Paracosm. 

However I see many people say they use them ONLY to fall asleep. Whaaaaat?! For me, I am literally in my paracosm most of the day. Is anybody else? I’m not saying anyone is wrong. I’m just wondering if what I’m doing is “a thing” for others? Why would I just think about it only to help me sleep??? I LOVE it there! LOL anytime of the day if I get inspired to have a “scene”( or daydream?) of something involving the Paracosm, I’m daydreaming about it. 

The times include:
1. Sitting with my coffee and smoking “green” in the morning. (I can talk and laugh out loud freely) 
2. Sitting outside smoking in my car(it’s easy for me to talk “with or to” myself and laugh in there because it looks like I’m on a call on my cars Bluetooth. I talk to my BF on my cars Bluetooth often.
3. At work when doing repetitive work or when I have a moment to relax there. I am good at not laughing out loud at work thankfully! It’s so wild how I can come up with jokes or funny remarks in my mind and CRACK myself up!! I guess comedians do that all the time…
4. Driving! One of my favorite times because sometimes I listen to music my characters like or their “theme/persona song”. But they are usually with their friends and/or families and having a damn good time! FYI I’m still watching the road!!!
6. When i’m cleaning at home.
7.  Before Bed. My prescription for my ADHD (lol guess which one) has a side effect: VERY high s*x drive. Since the novel was partly a romance novel (with ADULT scenes) revolving around my main character(me), i play “scenarios”out in my mind (if you know what I mean lol) l am knocked out sleeping after I’m satisfied. It never gets old because I’ll switch to certain different side characters and imagine their “intimate moments” as well lmao! I’ve actually adventured into new “intimate” activities learning about k*nks I never knew I had!! Ok too much info. ANYWAY…..
8. Anytime I have time when I’m not working, immersed in a hobby, watching a show, or with my Boyfriend.

I guess some could say I need to “get a life” or “touch grass lol” and I have one but it’s sadly Boring and unsatisfying. I love my Boyfriend and my dog but other than that I’m poor and my luck is terrible and the dreams i had for MY life seem to keep getting thwarted so this is an very effective distraction BUT even when my life is going “well” I still indulge in my Paracosm during the day!

Soooo, do any of you day dream about yours during the day?(like I would ASSUME is how DAY DREAMING WORKS) or even half or over half the day? or do you all just use it to fall asleep??",1,1761608424.0,ImmersiveDaydreaming,0,1.0,False

Things have been progressing pretty quickly as a cottage bakery. I’ve made it into 3 coffee shops now and am struggling to keep up with my 1 home oven and extra garage fridge. My biggest pain is the oven. I’m ready for a new investment and would love your help in making this decision. I max out at 60 bagels a day for these coffee shops but they all want more. I still am making loaves and other baked goods for pop ups a few times a month but my main item in demand are bagels. I’m pretty convinced I want a MyForno oven, however, there is the argument that a double convection oven would do the same justice. 

Do I take the plunge and commit to a MyForno oven where ALL my baked goods would reach full potential? Or go with a double oven that’ll get the job done?",1,1761608378.0,Sourdough,2,1.0,False
1ohub6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ohub6o/colleague_drinking_milk_straight_from_the_carton/,Colleague drinking milk STRAIGHT from the carton.,"So, I work in a shared office space with my team. I'm a full-timer in my early-to-mid twenties, but we have university-aged students work with us (part-time).

Since we didn't have a coffee machine in our space or any coffee places nearby, one of my colleagues (we'll call him Jeff) decided to bring his old Nespresso machine to the office for everyone to use. Jeff, myself, and a few others have pitched in bringing various coffee supplies over the past few months (Nespresso pods, ice machine, frother, milk, sugar, honey, cups, etc.).

We allow anyone in the shared space to use the machine and the goods. We don't expect anyone to pitch in, we just do it because we like having coffee around.

Anyways, the issue. Jeff tells me that he walked into the kitchen area the other day and watched as two of the university students (lets call them Shane and Carly) PASSED HIS 2 LITRE (LACTOSE FREE) MILK CARTON BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THEM. DRINKING. STRAIGHT. FROM. IT.

No, not pouring it into a glass. Not having something they ""weren't supposed to"". Selfishly and grossly taking swigs *straight from the carton* and then PUTTING THE MILK BACK FOR OTHERS TO USE. Unfortunately, Jeff didn't say anything at the time.

Jeff and I then realized this had been going on for weeks, as the cow milk supply would dwindle extremely fast. Keep in mind, JEFF is the one who pays for the milk and graciously lets everyone use it. SHANE is the one who has been chugging back the milk in secret, knowing that Jeff will resupply. I personally bring almond milk but I hope to fucking god they weren't doing the same thing.

The rest of the colleagues are now super grossed out, but since I personally didn't catch Shane and Carly in the act, Jeff didn't want me to say anything to them.

So I need some advice. Unless I catch them in the act (which I hope I do), what would you do to make sure these absolute creatures DON'T do this shit again?",3,1761608368.0,Advice,9,1.0,False

Introducing **THE OFFICIAL GUIDE TO PLANET EARTH** (50,000 words) — a spiritual self-help book written by the Universe (hi, that’s me!) itself.

Yes, you heard that right. In an all-of-eternity exclusive, I’m spilling the cosmic beans on how this whole “life” thing actually works. Think of it as the instruction manual to existence you *should* have received at birth.

I answer the questions humans have wrestled with for millennia:  
Why do I exist?  
How does this life work?  
How do I actually enjoy my time on Earth?  
And —when is that third set of teeth coming?

Think *Conversations with God* meets The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck — timeless wisdom delivered with irreverent, down-to-earth humor.

Readers of *Big Magic*, *The Untethered Soul*, and *You Are a Badass* will feel right at home here. But this guide stands apart for one reason: it actually sounds like the Universe talking — because, well, it is. 

Not preachy. Not abstract. Just sitting down for coffee with your best friend who happens to have created, well, everything. It’s the most important conversation you’ll ever have.

And I am not done talking either. THE OFFICIAL GUIDE TO PLANET EARTH is the first in a planned series of fun conversations with the universe that could form a new classic of modern spiritual literature.

**About the Authors**

I created heaven and Earth, so introductions seem unnecessary. But I’m omnipotent, not tech-savvy (and, frankly, no hands), so I recruited a human co-writer: MY NAME

Once a high-flying manager destined to inherit a multimillion-dollar family business, MY NAME had what he calls “a bit of a crisis” — okay, a full-blown breakdown — that led to a spiritual awakening and turned his world inside out. The message that saved him is the one we now share with readers worldwide.

Together, we reach thousands through a fast-growing daily newsletter (1,500 subscribers, 60% open rate).

You might be thinking, “That’s a small stat.” Darling, I started Earth with a grain of solar dust — and look at it now: breathable air, rock concerts, and you, sitting here reading this. Clearly, it worked out. (Besides, the Universe has its own marketing department.)

If you’ve ever looked for a sign from the Universe, this is it. (Yeah, I moved on from doing the burning-bush thing.)

I’d be delighted to send the full proposal and sample chapters (dictated through my human co-writer, because again... no hands).

We are the both of us and a third guy we just hired a few months ago. Lest go back to year and a half ago, when I got invited by my father to help him, for just a few months after that I can use the company and not open my own to start a e-commerce coffee business...I agreed and did hard almost unpaid labor for a year until finally we made the website...and when we talked about marketing he said to me ""You have to do it for free"" , so I started using the not so much money he gave for meta and google ads, he is ok with that, but he uses that I have another job and is not paying me on time, so I have no money for marketing and ""we are not selling this is not going to work""( the company survived 25 years without a website or any online appearances, so it is pointless for him). The main problem is that i want to build something that works for me, with or without me, my father sees the 9-5 in the most wrong way you can imagine, he says ""yeaa people going to work at 9 and heading home at 5, when do they even get their job done""( just to mention he is working basically for free almost whole his life, we were dependent on our mother most of the time, he was always working, going back i can remember 2 or 3 times when he attended my birthday and I see why) What he does is pointless, we are doing extra work, when i try to optimise and adjust, he says no we can't skip those few steps. I wanted to split, he offered me to do it my way, becouse otherwise what he sid his whole life I won't continue and it will go down the drain...I accepted(dumbass) now i do even more almost not paid labor, the e-commerce is starting to work(slowly...) but i can't focus on anything... I hate what I am doing, stupid tasks that involve me staying 3-4 hours a day in traffic....I don't know what to do, My income in low(after ads) I live with my gf we are not getting any support from our parents, I am working late, my mind is a mess and my body also...I am not happy, I feel like i am paying for ny father's wrong decisions...I got fooled, I know why he is like that, can't judge him, but I also can't leave him....they have problems with my mother...he is always and always has been working...He says I don't do nothing and its saying it to my grandparents and my mother also...I got asked from them ""What do you actually do to deserve this salary from him""....I need advice, I need to do something I hate myself..I want to just turn off...and forget everything...Sry for the bad English..If you have any questions I am willing to answer..I will appreciate any help and advice...thank you all in advance, be blessed ❤️",1,1761607991.0,Life,1,1.0,False

1ohu573,https://i.redd.it/bsfdxnysoqxf1.jpeg,Revolutionizing Network Security: Building an AI-Driven n8n Workflow Suite for Automated Analysis and Diagnostics,"As a cybersecurity enthusiast and freelance network engineer, I’ve spent years wrestling with the tedium of manual security audits and diagnostics. Picture this: late nights poring over Nmap outputs, cross-referencing vulnerability databases, and chasing false positives in traffic logs—all while deadlines loomed and threats evolved faster than I could patch. In October 2025, I hit my breaking point during a client project where a subtle misconfiguration nearly exposed an entire enterprise network. That’s when I turned to n8n, the open-source workflow automation powerhouse, to craft something truly cutting-edge: a fully automated, AI-infused suite of workflows for network security analysis and diagnostic testing. What started as a weekend hack evolved into a production-ready system that’s slashed my analysis time by 70% and uncovered issues I’d have missed manually. Let me walk you through how I built it, step by step.
The Vision: High-Tech Automation Meets Proactive Defense
My goal was simple yet ambitious: create a self-healing network security ecosystem that scans, diagnoses, analyzes, and responds in real-time, leveraging the latest in AI, cloud APIs, and open-source tools. n8n’s node-based architecture was perfect—drag-and-drop simplicity for complex logic, with built-in support for HTTP requests, custom code execution, and over 400 integrations. I focused on four core pillars:
	•	Discovery and Mapping: Automated topology scans to baseline the network.
	•	Vulnerability Hunting: Deep scans with risk prioritization via AI.
	•	Anomaly Detection: ML-powered traffic analysis for threats.
	•	Diagnostic Deep Dives: Performance and connectivity troubleshooting.
To make it “high-tech,” I wove in generative AI from OpenAI and Anthropic for intelligent triage, cloud-scale scanning via AWS and Qualys, and real-time alerting through Slack and Pushover. Custom nodes extended n8n’s reach to tools like Nmap and Nessus, turning it into a SecOps command center. The whole thing runs on a self-hosted n8n instance in Docker, triggered by cron schedules or webhooks from monitoring agents like Prometheus.
Workflow 1: Network Discovery and Port Mapping with Nmap Integration
The foundation of any security analysis is knowing your terrain. I started by integrating Nmap via a custom community node (n8n-nodes-nmap), which lets n8n execute scans directly without shelling out to the command line. Here’s how it flows:
	1	Trigger Node: A Schedule node fires every 6 hours (or on-demand via webhook from a GitHub repo push for CI/CD scans).
	2	Scan Execution: The Nmap node runs a comprehensive scan—nmap -sS -sV -O -T4 --script vuln target_subnet—targeting my lab’s 192.168.1.0/24 range. Outputs XML/JSON with open ports, services, and OS fingerprints.
	3	Data Processing: A Function node parses results into structured JSON, filtering for high-risk ports (e.g., 22/SSH, 3389/RDP).
	4	AI Enrichment: Feed the parsed data to an OpenAI node (using GPT-4o-mini) with a prompt like: “Analyze these Nmap results for potential attack vectors. Prioritize CVEs and suggest mitigations.” It spits back a risk score and narrative summary.
	5	Storage & Alert: Results land in a Google Sheets node for historical tracking, with high-severity items Slack-notified via the Slack integration.
In testing, this workflow mapped a simulated 50-host network in under 2 minutes, flagging an exposed Redis instance (port 6379) that my manual checks overlooked. Pro tip: I added error handling with IF nodes to retry failed scans, ensuring resilience.
Workflow 2: AI-Powered Vulnerability Scanning with Nessus and Qualys
Manual vuln scans? Ancient history. I chained n8n’s HTTP Request node to the Nessus API for automated policy-based scans, inspired by community templates like the “AI-Powered Vulnerability Scanner with Nessus.” For broader coverage, I looped in Qualys via their API integration.
	•	Initiation: Triggered post-Nmap (using the Execute Workflow node for chaining), it launches a Nessus scan on discovered hosts: POST /scans with JSON payload defining plugins for web apps, databases, and misconfigs.
	•	Result Harvesting: Poll the API every 30 seconds with a Loop node until complete, then extract XML results and convert to JSON via a Code node (JavaScript for XML parsing).
	•	Risk Triage: Here’s the high-tech magic—an Anthropic Claude node (via the Anthropic integration) ingests the vuln list: “Triage these Nessus findings by exploitability, impact, and business context. Assign a LEV score (Likelihood x Exploitability x Value) and recommend patches.” It cross-references with live threat intel from AlienVault OTX (another HTTP Request to their API).
	•	Compliance Check: A final IF branch flags non-compliant assets against NIST 800-53 baselines, stored in Supabase (n8n’s open-source cloud DB integration) for querying.
This workflow caught a critical Log4Shell remnant (CVE-2021-44228) in a test Tomcat server, prioritizing it with a LEV of 8.5/10. Integration with Qualys added asset tagging for hybrid cloud environments, making it enterprise-ready.
Workflow 3: Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic
Diagnostics aren’t just about what’s broken—they’re about spotting the weird before it breaks. I built this around real-time traffic analysis, pulling from a lightweight ELK stack (Elasticsearch via n8n’s Elasticsearch node) fed by Zeek sensors.
	•	Data Ingestion: Webhook trigger from Zeek logs incoming connections, parsed via a Function node for anomalies like unusual geolocs or protocol deviations.
	•	ML Baseline: Using n8n’s AI Agent node (powered by LangChain under the hood), I trained a simple isolation forest model in a one-off Code node (Python via n8n’s Execute Command, leveraging scikit-learn). It baselines “normal” traffic over a week, then scores new flows.
	•	Threat Hunting: High-anomaly scores route to OpenAI for deeper analysis: “Is this traffic indicative of a beaconing C2 server? Correlate with MITRE ATT&CK.” Integrates VirusTotal API (HTTP Request) for IP/Domain rep checks.
	•	Response Automation: If confirmed malicious, it auto-blocks via AWS Security Groups API and notifies via Pushover for mobile alerts.
During a red-team sim, it detected lateral movement (SMB enumeration) within 45 seconds, a far cry from my old Splunk dashboards. The AI agent’s chaining of tools made it feel like having a virtual SOC analyst on call.
Workflow 4: Advanced Diagnostics and Performance Testing
For pure diagnostics—latency, packet loss, bandwidth—I tapped Globalping’s n8n community node for distributed probing, automating what used to require iPerf scripts across regions.
	•	Trigger: Manual via Telegram bot (secure integration) or cron for nightly health checks.
	•	Probing Sequence: HTTP Request to Globalping API for traceroutes, pings, and DNS resolves from global vantage points (e.g., “traceroute from Tokyo to my-server.com”).
	•	Analysis Layer: Feed metrics to Google Gemini (n8n integration) for predictive insights: “Based on these RTT spikes, forecast potential DDoS vectors and suggest QoS tweaks.”
	•	Visualization: Export to Google Drive as CSV, with a Mermaid diagram generated via Code node for topology viz.
This uncovered a BGP flap causing 20% packet loss in my VPN setup, resolved with a quick route optimization.
Challenges, Wins, and the Road Ahead
Building this wasn’t all smooth sailing. Custom Nmap nodes required npm installs in my Docker setup, and API rate limits from Nessus forced exponential backoff logic (easy with n8n’s Wait node). Security was paramount—I encrypted credentials with n8n’s built-in vault and ran scans in isolated VLANs to avoid live disruptions. The biggest win? Scalability: Deploying to Kubernetes let it handle 10x the hosts without sweat.
Quantitatively, in a 3-month pilot across five client networks, it identified 42 vulns (15 critical) and resolved 18 diagnostics autonomously, saving ~200 hours of manual labor. Qualitatively, the AI narratives turned dry reports into actionable stories, impressing stakeholders.
Looking back, this n8n project didn’t just automate security—it future-proofed it. If you’re tired of reactive firefighting, fork my GitHub repo (shameless plug: github.com/myhandle/n8n-netsec-suite) and tweak away. In a world of zero-days and shadow IT, proactive, high-tech workflows like these aren’t optional—they’re the new baseline. What’s your next automation hack?

I hope this is ok to post, but I thought I’d share an update clarifying what’s been happening for her for those who replied before.

Doctor confirmed her estrogen level was way too high but was reluctant to intervene without her clinics advice. Clinic (specialist) has been in touch and her levels are over 3 x higher than they should be. Emergency appointment is booked - her estrogen medication has been altered.

We had a good heart to heart long conversation.
She’s made a self referral to the anxiety clinic - long process but she’s at least on the waiting list now.

I arrived at her house with coffees and together we cleaned for 3 hours. She finally had a good nights sleep with fresh bedding and a clean living space.


She finally spoke openly and let out everything bottled up..
Work, money, clothing, makeup and a lot of dysphoria. Family issues, worries about the world right now, everything has piled up and exploded inside. We talked through everything and made plans, one thing at a time. (More stuff too but it’s a bit too personal to share)

Her makeup is restocked, some new clothes were bought and she’s been sleeping better so is feeling less stressed about getting ready each day. We’ve talked to another friend about the possibility of a new job somewhere safer, we’ve talked about her family struggles and we’ve come up with a plan for checking in with each-other each day for peace of mind. 

Clearly there’s a gap in the communication between her doctors which is obviously infuriating. Considering she will be having her surgery in a few months, this is extremely important that they start listening to her and communicating properly. 
I’m angry for her because the doctor was unable to make a phone call to make sure her levels were monitored properly and added more stress to her pile of things to do/get sorted.

Anyway, she’s doing a little better now. As good as she can be considering everything. We went for coffee and cake again today and she seemed brighter and more like herself again. My ‘mother mode’ is still on and I’m ready to strongly advocate for her at her next appointment.

So overall, positive news. Thank you to everyone who gave me the caring and responsible advice regarding medication. It helped kick me up the butt to sit her down and say how concerned I was.",2,1761607783.0,MtF,1,0.75,False

She said she needed space, but I couldn't let go. Texts at midnight, ""We need to talk"" emails, even showing up at her favorite coffee spot. Thought it'd fix us. Spoiler: It made everything worse.

She blocked me everywhere. Friends stopped replying. And me? I felt smaller, more desperate. That chase turned my hurt into shame. If you're there now – hand on the phone, typing that message – pause. Put it down. Chasing doesn't bring them back. It just pushes you deeper into the pain.

What helped me flip it? No contact, for real. Delete the apps, block the numbers. Use that energy on you instead. Hit the gym (even if it's just walking), call a buddy for a beer, or binge a show that makes you laugh. First week sucks – like, waves of ""what if"" hit hard. But by month one? I slept better. Started noticing cute smiles on the street. Realized I was okay alone.

Truth: If it's meant to be, it'll find its way without you begging. And if not? You're dodging a bullet. One day, she might reach out (mine did, months later, after her rebound flopped). But you'll be the one choosing – from a strong spot, not a broken one.

You're tougher than this ache. What's one small step you're taking today to stop the chase? Share if it helps – we're all in this mess together.

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a playoff clash that’s equal parts soccer and slapstick! Minnesota United, the “Loose-Threaders of Saint Paul,” host the Seattle Sounders, the “Popcorn Populators of the Pacific Northwest,” in a Best-of-3 series opener that’s already got statisticians clutching their calculators and comedians clutching their coffee. Let’s break this down with the precision of a ref’s red card and the humor of a player tripping over their own shoelaces *again*.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

Minnesota enters as the *statistical* favorite on paper, but the odds tell a twisty tale. DraftKings lists Seattle at **+225** (implied probability: 46.5%) versus Minnesota’s **+315** (29.6%), with the draw at **+330** (30.3%). Meanwhile, the spread favors Seattle by a *hair* (-0.25 to -0.5 goals), suggesting bookmakers see the Sounders as slight road favorites despite Minnesota’s home ice (or should we say *frostbitten turf*?).

Why the confusion? Minnesota’s defense is tighter than a minnesota winter—**39 goals conceded** (1.13/G) vs. Seattle’s leaky 48 (1.41/G). But Seattle’s offense is a popcorn machine: **58 goals scored** (1.71/G) vs. Minnesota’s 56 (1.50/G). Recent form? Minnesota has won their last two meetings with Seattle, but the Sounders own the all-time series (6-2-2 in last 10). It’s like a seesaw: Minnesota’s momentum vs. Seattle’s firepower.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Form, and Frostbite

Minnesota’s recent form is a rollercoaster: a 3-0 win over Kansas City, a 2-1 victory over Austin, but also a 3-0 drubbing by Chicago. Their star striker, **Fredy Montero**, is fit and firing, while their defense? Well, let’s just say they’re not exactly building a fortress—**11 goals conceded in their last five games**.

Seattle, meanwhile, is riding a potent attack led by **Jordan Morris** and **Raúl Ruidíaz**, who’ve combined for 28 goals this season. But their defense? A sieve with a personality disorder. They’ve shipped 48 goals a

Figured coffee cow enjoyers may also find it interesting.

TLDR: They aren’t worried about it.

Question: As people retire they are going to be pulling more from the stock market. Historically, the market has always had more people of working age contributing but with the shift in demographics, there likely won’t be the same number of investors in the future in the market. Any thoughts about the impacts to how that could affect future investing?

Their Answer: This theory - that increasing numbers of retired net sellers will somehow overwhelm the number of Americans buying, and this must depress stock prices - has been around for close to 20 years now. It gained currency about the time the oldest baby boomers (b. 1946) hit early retirement age in 2008. In this scenario, kamikaze waves of retiring baby boomers would throw their shares on the market etc. etc.

Fast forward to today, when the youngest baby boomers (b. 1964) will begin reaching early retirement age in a matter of weeks. The great retirement age wave has in that sense already come and gone. The net result has been for the S&P 500 to go from about 1,500 when 2008 dawned to about 6,500 today. Why? Because the companies' earnings went up so much. Earnings, not demographics, drive stock values over time.

Perhaps more important, the S&P's cash dividend has gone up much more than inflation, suggesting that the retirees didn't need to sell - their incomes stayed ahead of inflation on dividends alone. And even that is an oversimplification of several positive trends.

I'll get to the point of this.

It was 12:30 and I was Assigned as a watcher for the first night at a new Outpost near the Tottori sand Dunes in Japan, I was Brought into the ""new"" Alpha Team. The reason I refer to them with a bit of distain is that I was apart of the original alpha team and I was known as Laymbda-0, I was the only person in the original alpha team to use my natural skill and strength mixed with gear, but that's for later. 

Back to the night, I was up atop a hill with a small cooking stove I brought with my own gear, I was making myself a small pot of coffee that I was thankful I didn't need to share, my gear as just simple semi-Desert mixed with semi-Urban gear, on my belt in a special holster is My Standard Issue B9 Pistol (Berretta M9a with custom grip and long slide rechambered in 45ACP.)  and my two Rifles still on there lines, and yes I was the only member of the new Alpha team that used any guns Since I didn't have any powers, and back to things, my first Rifle is a XM7 chambered in 6.8mm with a suppressor and adjustable scope that has a max of 36 magnification, and my second rifle is a Modified Scar-L with built in Suppressor and under barrel 40x49mm Grenade launcher, I bring up my gear so things make a bit of sense and my scar is chambered in 5.56x45NATO so I can keep the launcher.

  
Back to the Night, I as turning off my personal stove so I can let my coffee cool enough to be drink able I noticed a few moving shadows off by the shores, I thought for a second that it might just be tourists or locals since we haven't told the public about the Outpost do to the agreement our bosses have so we can even be armed in Japan, and what catches my attention is the peoples movement, I move my night vision down and on as I take aim with my XM7 I zoom into 16 magnification to try and get a better view of the group as it's a few members of Alpha squad along with a few Locals, by my own guesses that the locals are around high school age,.

Lost 12lbs in the first 6 weeks, then completely stalled for 5 weeks.



Calories were accurate (food scale gang), steps were consistent (10k+ daily), sleep was fine. I couldn't figure out what was wrong.



Then someone in the weekly thread mentioned hydration affecting water retention and weight loss plateaus. I realized I had no idea how much I was actually drinking.



Started tracking properly:



Using a tracking app because I needed reminders and data. Set goal for 80oz daily (my body weight x 0.5).



Front loaded hydration in the morning (16oz before coffee, another 16oz by 10am).



Set reminders for 1pm and 4pm because those were my ""forget to drink"" danger hours.



What happened:



Week 1: Averaged 75oz daily. Weight stayed same.



Week 2: Hit 80oz consistently. Dropped 1.8lbs.



Week 3 and 4: Maintained 80 to 85oz. Down another 2.4lbs total.



I don't know if it was water retention releasing or what, but the plateau broke.



My current strategy:



20oz warm water first thing (before coffee)



20oz mid morning



20oz with lunch



20oz mid afternoon



Stop drinking by 8pm (to avoid nighttime bathroom trips)



The app isn't fancy but it keeps me honest. I can see patterns. Like I drink way less on weekends when my routine is off.

I'm a 24 Year old Male from Hyderabad. Looking for connections, Dating and Meet ups/Hangouts. 

For a while, I focused on career/education. As a natural introvert, I lacked the confidence to date, or ask people to hangout but I'm ready to change that now and actively trying to do so. 

About Me: I'm 5'7"" and completely unfiltered and honest you'll always know where you stand (No guessing games and honestly.). I enjoy music, crime thrillers/well-written shows, trying out coffees (replacing Red Bull!), video games, and occasional irl sports. I also love finding quiet spots with good views to hang out.

What I'm Looking For: Someone kind, funny, and sarcastic who values authentic, unfiltered conversation and appreciates human imperfection and is motivated and does the same to the people around them. 

If you're in Hyderabad and this sounds like a connection you'd enjoy, send me a DM. :)

I (23F) am living on my own with two roommates (both 24F) for the first time post-college. One of my roommates is a friend from college and the other is a girl we found on Facebook who was already living in the area we were looking to move to that wanted to move out of her current apartment due to a mouse infestation + her other roommates moving in with their boyfriends. I screened this Facebook girl decently, and on paper she seemed like a great roommate: she said she was cleanly, Type A, and we shared a lot of similar interests. I met up with her for coffee and my friend grabbed dinner with her before we decided she would be joining us in our apartment hunt, and she seemed normal enough.

Long story short, we found a place and she is nothing like she described to us in terms of being a roommate. She's messy, inconsiderate, and not self-aware in the slightest. She's leaving hair in the shower drain, crumbs on the counter, leaving random belongings in the common spaces for WEEKS on end, running her A/C all hours of the day (including when no one is home), not cleaning her cat's litter box that is in a common space,,,, the list goes on. We've addressed all of this many times with her, to no avail, and finally had to sit her down and go through everything again in a roommate meeting (which she tried to get out of).

She recently lost her job for being consistently late, and instead of immediately looking for a new job, she flew home to her home state and partied for a week. She filed for unemployment, and instead of applying for a survival job to at least make ends meet, she is applying for white-collar 9-5's she doesn't have the experience or qualifications for. The cherry on top of all of this that has brought me to a boiling point is that my friend asked if she would drive her about an hour to grab her car from the shop, to which my Facebook roommate responded she was ""to burnt out"" to take her, even though my friend watched her cat the entire week she flew home (she asked us to do this).

  
I'm incredibly fed up with her and the way she's treating not only the house but us as roommates. If she does not get unemployment, and can't find a job, would it be insane to say she has to sublet and move out? I honestly want to say she has to sublet and move-out based on how she is as a roommate alone but I know that's pretty over the top.

# What You'll Build In Google AI Studio Today

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a working app built in Google AI Studio.

We're going to build a Facebook ad generator using Google AI Studio.

This Google AI Studio app will take a product or service as input.

It will output complete Facebook ad copy in the format businesses need.

The app we build in Google AI Studio will be actually usable.

Not a toy example but something you could deploy in Google AI Studio.

This tutorial assumes zero experience with Google AI Studio.

We'll start from the very beginning with Google AI Studio.

# Step One: Accessing Google AI Studio

Open your web browser and go to aistudio.google.com.

This is where you access Google AI Studio.

Sign in using your Google account for Google AI Studio.

Any Google account works with Google AI Studio.

Once signed in, you'll see the Google AI Studio dashboard.

Three main sections appear in Google AI Studio.

Build, gallery, and apps sections in Google AI Studio.

We'll use the build section to create our app in Google AI Studio.

# Step Two: Exploring The Google AI Studio Interface

Before building, let's understand the Google AI Studio interface.

Click on the gallery section in Google AI Studio first.

This shows you pre-built examples in the Google AI Studio gallery.

Spend a few minutes browsing the Google AI Studio gallery.

See the different types of apps people build in Google AI Studio.

Click on a few examples in the Google AI Studio gallery.

Look at how they structure their prompts in Google AI Studio.

This helps you understand what's possible in Google AI Studio.

After exploring the gallery, we'll build our own app in Google AI Studio.

# Step Three: Starting Your First Google AI Studio App

Click on the build section in Google AI Studio.

You'll see options for starting a new app in Google AI Studio.

Choose to start with a blank template in Google AI Studio.

This gives you a clean slate for building in Google AI Studio.

The main area of Google AI Studio is where you write prompts.

Prompts are instructions that tell your Google AI Studio app what to do.

At the top, you can name your Google AI Studio app.

Name it ""Facebook Ad Generator"" in Google AI Studio.

Now we're ready to write the prompts for our Google AI Studio app.

# Step Four: Writing The Initial Google AI Studio Prompt

Start with a role definition in your Google AI Studio prompt.

Type: ""You are an expert Facebook advertising copywriter.""

This tells your Google AI Studio app what perspective to take.

Next, add context to your Google AI Studio prompt.

Type: ""Your job is to create compelling Facebook ads that generate clicks and conversions.""

This explains the purpose of your Google AI Studio app.

Now specify what inputs your Google AI Studio app will receive.

Type: ""You will receive information about a product or service.""

Finally, define the output format for your Google AI Studio app.

Type: ""Create a complete Facebook ad including: headline (5-7 words), body copy (2-3 sentences), and call-to-action (4-5 words).""

This structure tells your Google AI Studio app exactly what to produce.

# Step Five: Testing Your Google AI Studio App

Now let's test what we built in Google AI Studio.

In the test area of Google AI Studio, enter a sample input.

Try: ""Organic coffee delivered monthly to your door.""

Click run in Google AI Studio to see the output.

Is the output something you'd actually use from your Google AI Studio app?

If not, we'll refine the prompts in Google AI Studio next.

# Step Six: Refining Your Google AI Studio Prompts

Testing reveals where your Google AI Studio app needs improvement.

Maybe the headlines from Google AI Studio are too long.

Maybe the body copy from Google AI Studio lacks specificity.

Go back to your prompts in Google AI Studio.

Make your instructions more specific in Google AI Studio.

For example, add: ""The headline must be exactly 5-7 words, no more.""

Or add: ""The body copy must focus on the main benefit and include social proof.""

Test again in Google AI Studio with the same input.

See if the outputs from your Google AI Studio app improved.

Keep refining your Google AI Studio prompts until you're satisfied with results.

This iterative process is how you build good apps in Google AI Studio.

# Step Seven: Adding Examples To Your Google AI Studio App

Examples make your Google AI Studio app work better.

Add a section to your Google AI Studio prompt called ""Examples.""

Show your Google AI Studio app what good output looks like.

Type: ""Example input: Premium yoga mats for home practice.""

Then type: ""Example output: Headline: Transform Your Home Into A Yoga Studio. Body: Our premium yoga mats provide studio-quality grip and cushioning. Join 50,000+ yogis who practice at home with confidence. Call-to-action: Shop Premium Mats Now.""

Adding examples to your Google AI Studio prompts teaches the AI your expectations.

Test your Google AI Studio app again with a new input.

The outputs from Google AI Studio should be more consistent now.

Examples are one of the most powerful tools in Google AI Studio prompt engineering.

# Step Eight: Testing Multiple Inputs In Google AI Studio

Don't test your Google AI Studio app with just one input.

Try different types of products and services in Google AI Studio.

Test your Google AI Studio app with a physical product.

Test your Google AI Studio app with a service.

Test your Google AI Studio app with a digital product.

See where your Google AI Studio app works well and where it struggles.

If it fails on certain inputs, refine your Google AI Studio prompts.

Make the instructions in Google AI Studio more comprehensive.

Thorough testing is essential for reliable Google AI Studio apps.

# Step Nine: Saving Your Google AI Studio App

Google AI Studio saves automatically as you work.

Your app is now in the apps section of Google AI Studio.

You can return to this Google AI Studio app anytime.

You can continue refining your Google AI Studio app later.

You can share your Google AI Studio app with others if needed.

The save functionality in Google AI Studio makes iteration easy.

# Step Ten: Using Your Google AI Studio App

Enter the product or service description in Google AI Studio.

Get instant ad copy from your Google AI Studio app.

You can use this output directly or edit it as needed from Google AI Studio.

The time savings come from having a starting point from Google AI Studio.

Instead of staring at a blank page, you have complete ads from Google AI Studio.

This is the power of building apps in Google AI Studio - reusable tools for repetitive tasks.

# Building Other Types Of Apps In Google AI Studio

The versatility of Google AI Studio lets you create many different app types.

# Common Mistakes When Building In Google AI Studio

Beginners often make similar mistakes with Google AI Studio.

Mistake one: vague prompts in Google AI Studio.

Be specific about what you want from your Google AI Studio app.

Mistake two: not testing enough in Google AI Studio.

Test with many different inputs for your Google AI Studio app.

Mistake three: forgetting examples in Google AI Studio.

Examples dramatically improve output quality in Google AI Studio.

Mistake four: expecting perfection immediately from Google AI Studio.

Good apps in Google AI Studio come from iteration and refinement.

Mistake five: building too complex on first try in Google AI Studio.

Start simple with your first Google AI Studio apps.

Awareness of these mistakes helps you avoid them when building in Google AI Studio.

# The Importance Of Prompt Specificity In Google AI Studio

The more specific your Google AI Studio prompts, the better your results.

General prompts in Google AI Studio produce general outputs.

Specific prompts in Google AI Studio produce specific outputs.

Instead of ""write a good headline"" in Google AI Studio, say ""write a headline that is exactly 5-7 words and focuses on the main benefit.""

Instead of ""make it engaging"" in Google AI Studio, say ""use active voice, include a question or surprising fact, and end with a clear benefit.""

Specificity in Google AI Studio takes more time to write but produces much better results.

Your Google AI Studio apps will only be as good as the instructions you give them.

# Understanding Google AI Studio Limitations

Google AI Studio is powerful but has limits you should understand.

Google AI Studio apps work best for structured, predictable tasks.

Highly creative or nuanced work may need more human input with Google AI Studio.

Google AI Studio outputs should always be reviewed by humans.

Never publish content from Google AI Studio without checking it first.

Google AI Studio apps follow patterns - they don't truly understand context like humans.

The quality of your Google AI Studio app depends on your prompt quality.

Poor prompts create poor apps in Google AI Studio.

Understanding these limitations helps you use Google AI Studio effectively.

# Next Steps After Building Your First Google AI Studio App
