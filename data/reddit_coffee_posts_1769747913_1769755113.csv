Chapter 6: The ambush

“Thank you for coming to McDonald’s, your order is # 47” The McDonalds Cashier said to John and Evan

“Order number 44, a big mac and some fries” another cashier yelled.

“Hey, I wonder where Josh went” Evan asked.

“He’s been in the bathroom for a long time” John replied. “Mabye he had diarhee-” 

“BANG” a loud snapping noise boomed at sonic speed before John could even finish his sentance, alomst giving Evan and John hearing loss, as a loud noise and projectile blew past John’s ear, missing his ear by about a quarter of an inch

John looked out of the corner of his eye and saw two police officers with their guns drawn one of the two doors of the McDonalds

“RUN!” John yelled.


John and Evan immediately ran twords the other door to the McDonald’s.

The rest of the McDonald’s customers and employees quickly screamed and immediately ducked under the tables or behind the counter. 


Just after John and Evan started running, Evan felt like someone had punched him in the nose and put lemon juice in his nose. 

“AHHHHH!” Evan screamed in pain

He put his hand to his nose and felt his hand get wet, and he looked at his hand and saw blood all over it, and he even looked down and saw his nose bent 15 degrees to the right, realizing he had just been shot in the nose and his nose was likely broken, as a police officer was at his 8 o clock position diagonal to him about 10 feet away to the side of the door they came in, firing and hitting Evan from a diagonal angle.


The police started chasing after them, and the police were gaining on them, when all of the sudden, Evan looked out of the corner of his eye and saw one police officer trip over a woman’s purse as she left her purse on the ground, and the other police officer tripped over the 1st police officer, as John and Evan made it to the door and ran out of the fast food joint.

“Watch it!” the second office who tripped over the first officer yelled

“They’re over here, no, wait, shit, they’re over there” the first officer who tripped over the woman’s purse yelled.”

The two officers got back up and looked for John and Evan, but it was of no use, as John and Evan were nowhere to be seen. 

Meanwhile, John and Evan continued running across the southside of Chicago, wondering how they would evade being captured,

“I hate that my nose stings and bleeds so much” Evan complained as droplets of blood came out of his nose as he huffed out as he kept running and running with John

“Evan, you’re lucky that that didn’t kill you! Had that bullet been an inch off, it would have hit you in the head and you’d likely be dead” John replied continuing to huff as he run

“Wait, so in terms of what happened to Josh, he likely just only freed us in order to call the police and tell them of our wearabouts in hopes of collecting money, right?” Evan asked and huffed as he continued to run

“I think so” John replied and huffed as he continued to run. “When he was in the bathroom at that McDonalds, he likely called the police on us so he could collect money”

 and after several hours of running and fast walking, they made it to a rail yard outside a factory in East Chicago Indiana, where they saw a sign saying “Steel supplied to Canada  this way”, “Steel supplied to Mexico that way.” and they saw boxcar trains full of steel bars go in each of those directions, and both of them realized that the best way to avoid a run-in with the police like the just had was by fleeing the country.

Chapter 7: The Breakup



“Ok, so now that we have escaped prison, what will we do next?” Evan asked.

“We’ll probably flee to Mexico where the tax laws are very loosely enforced.” John replied.

“But I don’t want to go to Mexico, I want to go to Canada where there is an enormous welfare state.” Evan complained. 

“Well, I’m sure as hell not going to Canada where I’d be forced to spend all of my hard-earned tax dollars on lazy bums like you!” John yelled.

“Did you just call me a lazy bum?!” Evan snapped back.

“That’s exactly what you are, a lazy bum!” John snapped. “You’ve never worked a day in your life and all you ever do is leech off of hard-working taxpayers like me to pay for your luxurious lifestyle while I get none of the luxuries you can get. That’s exactly why I stopped paying taxes 20 years ago!”

“Fine, I’m going to Canada by myself.” Evan declared, as a bit of blood continued to trickle out of his nose where the police had shot him earlier, and he even saw some white pus-like fluid start to come out of it

“I’m going to Mexico by myself.” John declared.

Evan hopped on the boxcar train full of steel that was headed twords Candada, while John hopped on the boxcar train full of steel that was headed twords Mexico, and they parted their separate ways. 

Chapter 8: Monotony

Once Evan rode that train from East Chicago to Toronto he got a job as a safety inspector at a nuclear power plant and bought a cheap apartment downtown. The next few weeks were a steady routine for Evan: 

Go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, change out the tissues you put in your broken nose to make sure it doesn’t bleed,  go to bed: 

Evan knew that he couldn’t go to the hospital because he would have to file paperwork, which would almost certainly get an ID put on him, and the police would know where he was and arrest him

go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, change out the nose tissues, go to bed: 

go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, change out nose tissues, go to bed: 

go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, change out nose tissues, go to bed:

and so on. 

Evan loved having a steady routine for once, as this was something he had never had before as a criminal who was always running from the law. In Canada, he got a steady job and never resorted to welfare fraud. One day Evan was watching the news when he heard a disturbing report.

“This just in, a man named John was kidnapped and brutally beaten by the infamous gang MS-13 in Tijuana Mexico” John’s full name and face were shown across the TV screen and a video was shown of John being tortured.

“Good riddance!” Evan said to himself “That’s what he gets for not listening to me and going to Mexico instead. I hope those taxes were worth evading.”

A few more weeks went by when Evan was subject to the same old monotonous routine: 

Go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed, change out nose tissues: 

Go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed, change out nose tissues: 

Go to work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed, change out nose tissues: 

Go work, buy groceries, watch TV, go to bed, change out nose tissues.  

And so on and so on.
Evan started to hate the monotony of the routine he once loved. He realized just how boring life had become without someone to argue with like John. Evan then became so lonely without John or anyone else in his life that he found himself pacing around the floor at his lunch break talking to himself, and his coworkers started to get weirded out. 

“Sure, I might be bored and lonely, but am I going to risk life and limb just to save someone I love to hate when I already have a broken nose that occasionally oozes pus?” Evan said to himself while he was pacing around the lunchroom floor.

“Evan, what the hell are you doing? You’ve been pacing around talking to yourself in public all lunch break? You seem lonely and you need a friend!” Rick, one of Evan’s coworkers, yelled at Evan while they were in the coffee break room at the nuclear power plant. 

“You seem lonely and you need a friend!”

“You seem lonely and you need a friend!”

“You seem lonely and you need a friend!”

“You seem lonely and you need a friend!” 

Rick's words rang in Evan’s ears over and over again.

“A friend eh?” Evan said to himself. “I think I know just where one is in Tijuana, Mexico who just so happens to need my help.”

Evan sprinted out the door toward the parking lot

“What are you doing this time!?” Rick asked

“Risking my life to save someone I hate for reasons I don’t quite understand. Gotta go!” 

Evan yelled back at Rick as he sprinted out the door. He ran over to the nearby train station where he booked a ticket to Tijuana.

“Time to fight a drug cartel and kick ass!” Evan whispered to himself as he boarded the train to Tijuana.


Chapter 9: Evan’s thoughts as he rides the train 

As the train left Toronto and left twords Tijuana, Evan started to have a life review, imagining every moment that led up to this point in his life. How he started off life with an alcoholic father who beat him and left him when he was only 7 years old. He had plans to one day be an engineer, but when he was 16, his single mom who worked two jobs got cancer and was bed ridden, thus forcing Evan to drop out of high school so that he could get a job and care for his mother. He got various odd jobs washing dishes at various restaurants, but he barely scraped by, and he often fell behind on his payments to his apartment, so much so that he eventually had his apartment repossessed. He tried moving to a cheaper area of the country, to afford living in a cheaper apartment, but even there, he still couldn’t make ends meet and still lost that apartment and ended up back on the streets homeless. He applied for supplemental-income-welfare programs to go along with work, not as a substitute for work, but those welfare programs were only a few extra hundred dollars per year, and along with his various crappy jobs of washing dishes and working in fast food restaurants, they were never enough to pay the bills, and he would always wind up homeless and in a homeless shelter again, no matter how hard he tried. Evan wondered how the hell he was supposed to get by in the game of life, but one day when he was hanging out with one of his coworkers, he noticed that he had a really nice two bedroom apartment despite the fact that his job didn’t pay that much. Evan asked how he was able to do it, and the coworker replied by showing him IDs that he stole, cut out their photos, and replaced with his own photo, and showed that he could cheat the welfare system in order to get by by having multiple fake accounts. Evan even objected to his coworker doing this, stating that it seemed incredibly unethical to be loafing off of the welfare system by creating multiple fake accounts, but his coworker told him that life had cheated him out of a good chance by making his dad leave him at age 7 and his mom get sick forcing him to drop out of high school to take care of her at age 16, therefore, he should even the score and cheat life by creating multiple fake welfare accounts. Evan reluctantly agreed to go along with the plan, and hence, that’s how he got his career of crime started.

Chapter 10: John’s thoughts during a break from being tortured:

After the MS-13 gang-members realized that they weren’t getting any useful information  about America’s weakpoints about John by torturing him, the decided to throw him into a solitary confinement cell where he would be all on his own, with nothing but his own thoughts, and as John was locked in his own cell by himself, he started to have a life review thinking back on all of the life moments that led up to this moment, that might very well be his last if the MS-13 gang members decide to kill him if they can’t get any useful information out of him. John thought about at the age of 8, his dad died in a coal mining accident, leaving his mom all alone and leaving him scared for life. Then at the age of 15, his single mom became bed ridden with a rare flesh-eating disease, and he was forced to drop out of high school and take care of her. Eventually John tried various jobs working at fast food restaurants and babysitting children in order to make ends meet, but he still couldn’t make ends meet and he ended up back on the streets homeless. He applied for supplemental-income-wellfare programs to go along with is work, but even those welfare programs were still only a few extra hundred dollars per year, but even that along with other odd jobs wasn’t enough to pay the bills, and he always ended back up homeless and in a homeless shelter again, no matter how hard he tried. One day when he was hanging out with one of his drifter buddies while the drifter buddy was at his one room apartment, John asked how on earth he was able to afford all of this stuff, and his drifter buddy explained to him that he just stopped filling out tax forms and therefore, got to keep 40% of his income. John even objected to his drifter buddy doing this, saying that it seemed immoral to dodge paying taxes, but his drifter buddy explained to him that life had cheated him out of getting by by having his dad die in a coal mining accident at age 8, and having his mom come down with a flesh eating disease at age 16 forcing him to drop out of high school to care for her, therefore, he should even the score with life and cheat life by dodging taxes. Besides, the government takes 40% of our income and says that they will do something to help poor people with dead end jobs at fast food restaurants like us, but they just take our money and do nothing with it. John reluctantly agreed to just stop paying taxes, and that is how his career of crime started. Soon after John’s train of thought started, the guards came back and ordered another round of waterboarding.

Chapter 11 Evan frees John

The train got off in Tijuana in a train station in a sketchy ally with city maps for both English and Spanish telling tourists where various attractions and shops are, and one of them was a gun shop, which would allow Evan to get his hand on a weapon so he could take down MS-13 and save John. 
“Why is a gun shop one of the primary tourist destinations listed on the map?” Evan thought to himself out loud

“Mexico has very loose gun laws unlike Canada and the US, so people from across the border in San Diego cross the border all the time just to get guns.” a tourist responded to Evan.

“Oh, you speak English?” Evan asked.

“Yeah, virtually everyone in Tijuana speaks both English and Spanish,” the tourist responded.

Evan then found a currency exchange station where he exchanged his Canadian dollars for Mexican pesos. Even even snuck into the bathroom at the Tijuana train station and pulled the toilet paper out of his nose that was covered in blood and a bit of pus, and replaced it with new toilet paper. Evan then walked a few blocks to the nearby gun shop where he purchased a gun and some ammo to take down MS-13 to save his friend. As soon as he started to wonder how he could find MS-13, he saw a guy with a large MS-13 tattoo and asked him if he could join MS-13 as a new member.

“That’s a talk between you and the leader. I will take you to him, but to join MS-13, you first must prove your loyalty to him.” The guy with the MS-13 tattoo explained. 

Evan followed him through a maze of complex allies, each one sketchier than the last, into an enormous run-down warehouse-looking building with a 10-foot pyramid structure in the center, and at the top of the pyramid was a golden chair with a fat man sitting in it.

“Why have you come to bother me?!” the fat man snapped.

“We have a new potential recruit to MS-13.” the guy with the MS-13 tattoo replied.

“Hmmmmm, that’s odd, we haven’t had a recruit in several years. Well, I guess we could always use more members.” the fat man said to himself “Your loyalty test to this organization will be that you are required to assassinate Tijuana city council member Luis Francheco and have his corpse brought to me. He is the primary member of the Tijuana city council who is trying to push corruption out of the Tijuana city government and we rely on that corruption so that we can continue to bribe the government officials so that they don’t arrest us. Do you understand?”

“Yes sir,” Evan replied. “Do you by chance happen to know where you guys keep your prisoners?” 

“That is confidential information that I can not tell you until you have brought Luis Francheso’s corpse to me.” The fat man replied.

“Understood.” Evan replied.

Evan walked out of the MS-13 layer and walked a few blocks until he saw an ally where he could buy some roofies. Evan then ran his next errand to a local grocery store where he purchased a big bottle of wine and a pen and a thank you card where he wrote “Thank you Mr. Franchesco for being the best city council member, we have a gift for you in the form of a bottle of wine.” Once Evan was out of the store, he opened the bottle of wine and opened the package of roofies and dumped the roofies into the wine bottle. Last but not least, Evan got on a bus and went to the outskirts of town where he saw a farm. He snuck onto that farm and slaughtered one of the pigs and emptied the blood from the pig’s carcass into the same jar he used to carry the battery acid during their escape from prison. Evan then rode the bus to city hall and went into Mr. Franchesco’s office and put the thank you card and the bottle of wine on his desk. Evan then heard Mr. Franchesco’s footsteps down the hallway approaching his room at the end of the hallway, so Evan hid in the closet in Mr. Franchesco’s office and peeped through the ventilation desk to see Mr. Francesco sit down in his office chair.

“Oh Boy!” Mr. Franchesco said to himself “Someone’s left a big bottle of wine and a thank you card for me. I normally don’t drink at work, but it’s 4 pm, so I guess we can make an exception here. Plus it’s been a long stressful day for me. “Juan, my assistant, can you take a sip of this wine for me please so that I don’t get poisoned?.. Oh, I forgot, he’s out sick today.”

Evan quietly breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing that Mr. Franchesco’s taster assistant was out sick today, and Mr. Francesco took a sip of the wine and instantly passed out. Evan then looked in the hallways to see that no one was coming, and he saw that no one was there, so Evan dragged Mr. Franchesco’s unconscious body out the door. Once he was out the door, Evan dumped the vile of pig blood, which looked just like the blood from his own broken nose, all over Mr. Franchesco’s dead body to make it look like he killed him. Evan then used all of his strength to drag Mr. Franchesco’s body to the MS-13 lay and present it below the fat man who led MS-13. 

“Excellent work.” the fat man said to Evan. “You are officially now our newest member.”

“So where exactly does MS-13 keep their prisoners?”

“We keep them at 4-303 Bolivar Rd. When you get out of the warehouse, you make a right out of the driveway onto our street and go down it 6 blocks and then you make a left onto Bolivar Road. You will then go down 3 and a half more blocks and you will come across 4-303 bolivar road on your left. I am granting you this MS-13 badge. Just show the guards this badge and they will let you in. May I ask why do you want to go into our gang prison?” The fat man replied.

“Because there’s this guy in there named John who I am going to shoot with my pistol because he’s behind on his mortgage to me. I lent him a car, and he has now been behind on his monthly payments for 6 months in a row, so I’m going to show him why you don’t mess with me” Evan responded.
“Well, we hate John too. We only captured him in the hope that we could hold him ransom for the US government, and because they have refused to buy him from us, he’s essentially a useless prisoner who you are free to kill.” The fat man replied. 

John walked 6 blocks, turned left at Bolivar Road, walked 3 and a half blocks more, and found 4-303 Bolivar Road and opened the door to get in. Once he opened that door, there was a short hallway with a door at the end with two more guards who both had guns both pointed at Evan and announced.

“Halt! Please show us your ID and your purpose for the entry” 

“I have been sent here to kill prisoner John,” Evan announced. “The boss ordered for him to be killed because we were unable to sell him for ransom back to the US government. Here is my ID.” Evan showed him the badge

“Your entry is granted!” the guards stepped out of the way and withdrew their guns. “Here is the key to Evan’s cell.”

 Evan then walked through the maze of cells filled with prisoners who were beaten, bloodied, and battered, until he came across the one he was here for. He approached John’s cell and unlocked it and saw both John and a cellmate in the form of a 13 year old girl who was kept with him in his cell.

“Evan?” John asked, with blood droplets coming out out of wounds on his torso and arms

“Yes, it’s me, Evan,” Evan replied. “I’m here to set you free.”

“I can't believe you risked your life to save me?!” John said as he hugged Evan and cried

“Shhhh!” Evan whispered loudly “We have to be quiet and remain out of sight. MS-13 could send out reinforcements anytime.

	“Who is this person here in this prison cell with you” Evan asked John.

	“This is the President’s daughter, my cell mate who was assigned to me.

	“Can I escape with you?” -The president’s daughter asked John and Evan

	“Yeah . . . sure . . . why not.” Evan replied. 

	“Why does your friend have a nose bent 25 degrees to the right and has tissues lodged into it, and has little droplets of blood and pus comming out of it and has the tip of his nose turn black?” The President’s daughter asked. 

Evan, John, and The President’s daughter then all ran out of the prison together, where Evan tried to shoot the guard in the knee to prevent him from running, but the gun jammed, and the guard started to gain on Evan and John. The guard was gaining on them and right on their tail, when all of the sudden, the guard happened to trip over a dislodged sidewalk tile that was uprooted by a tree trunk, causing him to fall over. The guard even to fire right at Evan’s foot while he was on the ground

“EVAN, JUMP!” John yelled as he noticed that the guard who had tripped got out his gun and tried to fire at John’s foot as a last resort.

The guard fired and John jumped just as the guard shot his gun twords John, causing him to miss the bullet by inches that was below him. 


“AHHHHH!” The President’s daughter screamed after the bullet was fired and John jumped. Evan, John, and the President’s daughter all continued to run further and further north twords the Tortilla wall in hopes of scaling it with a rope Evan purchased when he bought those supplies and climbing into San Diego to evade MS-13.

They kept running until they were a block away from the Tortilla wall when all of the sudden, Evan, John, and The President’s daughter were all tackled to the ground by men in black in sun glasses and put in handcuffs and put into a white van. 

“Oh no, are we getting kidnapped again?” Evan asked.

The White van drove the trio twords I-5, and went through the San-Ysdiro border crossing into San Diego, and as soon as they were back in San Diego, the agents in black unhandcuffed John and Evan, handed John and Evan letters, and threw them back out of the car as soon as they got into San Diego, while they unhancuffed the President’s daughter but kept her in the car as it drove away. 

As soon as John and Evan were thrown out of the car in San Diego and were handed their letters, they got them out and read them 

“In light of recent extenuating circumstances involving an immediate family  member of the President of the United States of America, all pending charges against you are hereby dismissed.”

“Is this really happening?” John asked

“I’m gonna have to pinch myself to make sure I’m actually dreaming” Evan said.

Evan and John continued to walk down the street in San Diego, wondering what they would do next with their lives.

1qqxarm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1qqxarm/abusive_short_term_relationship/,Abusive short term relationship,"Abusive short term relationship

I dated a woman for 3 weeks only.

On the first week she “opened” up with all of her baggage - I dont know why I didn’t run as she mentioned BPD, bad relationships with parents, ex’es, being abusive to people. She did however go to therapy and “completed” it.

She was quite ok at first. Hospitable.

But I noticed one thing I didnt like is how when she needed help - she would ask her friend (who is also her ex) to help her. It was mostly about moving in - the ex would bring sofas in and tables into her house and sit with us to chat and drink coffee. All she did when ex was bringing in the tables was just sit and smoke.

Ex mentioned to me that she is quite “childish” for her age (both in their 40s), but describes her as a “nice person”.

I dont know what kind of desperation took me up to keep on going with her.

Also whenever I needed small things from her she would make an excuse that her “ADHD” is not letting her do the things and thats why she forgets and needs constant reminders from me. Even simple as her promising to make coffee for me and yet not doing so.

One day this week I had bad things happen to me and I needed to “disconnect” from her a bit - I knew she couldn’t help and I just told her “I need to have time by myself, sorry If I am distant”. She blamed me for “getting cold towards her” instantly. She didnt like how I didnt say “goodmorning” to her when I saw her at work (yes we are also coworkers) but i explained that it was because I was in my head so much and could not communicate properly with anyone around. She still didn’t accept it.

Because of these things I just decided to get my stuff and leave. I told her to prepare some of my items that were left in her house and she did and then opened a pandora box of blames.

She blamed me for “getting suddenly cold (even when I explained to her what was up), acting disconnected towards her, she was making herself look “better” by telling me the internal things she was “going through” for me like - dealing with the age gap (we both are - we have 15 years of age gap - its not new for me to date a bit older people but it was new for her to date younger).

She blamed me for not going to therapy because I “hide” emotions when I feel bad and dont communicate them in a “healthy” way. But all I got was a hug from her when I explained that my friend is dying…

When I confronted her with not doing much / not listening to me talk much and not keeping her promises - she told me I assume things about her and its usually because of her ADHD that she has struggle to do things in time - but she “still does them” and she told me not to “assume” she doesnt care about me because she does and all she wanted was me to be more “open to communicate properly” instead of shutting her down.

Only one time at work she asked me “how are you - you seem to act different” and that was it. I did not tell her as I knew she wont move a finger to help me anyways.

During this conversation before I went out I told her “hey I will take my responsibilities” but all she told me that “you assumed things way too wrong and It is not the reality what you think or assume”, because I told her that she is acting exactly like the people who only care about themselves and their struggles.

She was getting mad on me that I “made assumptions”… yet her actions proved my point and I dont think ADHD is a good excuse.

When I was stepping throught the door when she was angry - she started blaming me just for “leaving her like that” with no care in the world. I did care but didnt show her anymore as every word I said to her was wrong.

Just because of my only mistake she was set off so much. I am glad I left but I am so tired of attracting people like this who just set alarms off in a second just for me being distant for a day while they do all this blaming on me.

Why cant I have someone genuinely nice?

Also I am so sorry for her ex who just keeps on coming back to her place to help her so much. I feel like she is cought in her manipulation tactics but doesnt have self respect to get out.

I am so glad I told her “I am strong enough to hangle all my life problems myself - I dont need no empathy from you - when going though the door”.

Ofcourse she blamed me for being “self centered”…",0,1769752728.0,CPTSD,1,0.33,False

 I (23M) met a girl (21F) last week for coffee. It was super brief, say an hour. she kinda called it short, said she had to be somewhere. however, she messaged me within a few mins, told me she isn’t active on apps and gave me her number. we messaged back & forth, say 3-4 messages a day asynchronously, just asking each other about our day etc. I asked her out again earlier this week, and she said she’s good to meet. I followed up with options for restaurants, asking her opinion, and she’s ghosted me since (a little over a day).

1qqx88u,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MubGxCSNuIQ,Кілька цікавих моментів з нового інтерв’ю Івана Пеньори,"Вчора вийшло інтерв’ю з українським обсмажчиком кави **Іваном Пеньорою** \- засновником **Penyora Specialty Coffee**. У відео він досить детально розповідав про свій підхід до кави та виробництва, і там було кілька моментів, які можуть бути цікаві для кавової спільноти.

1. **Свіжа обсмажка - не завжди означає кращий смак** За словами Пеньори, кава має свій пік смаку приблизно на 7–10 день після обсмажки. Занадто свіжа кава може бути нестабільна, різка або «порожня». Тому дата обсмажки важлива, але вона не гарантує, що кава вже в найкращій формі.
2. **Сортування зерна - великий шмат роботи, про який майже ніхто не думає** Іван Пеньора розповідав, що після обсмажки кава проходить кілька етапів очищення.

Спочатку використовується **дестонер** \- пристрій, який прибирає камінці, метал та інші важкі сторонні предмети, що можуть випадково потрапити в зерно ще на фермі.

Потім кава проходить через **фотосепаратор**. Це машина з камерами та датчиками, яка фотографує кожне зерно на швидкості і за допомогою повітря відстрілює дефектні - квакери, недозрілі, пересушені або з неправильним кольором.

У результаті частину кави просто відбраковують. За словами Пеньори, інколи з 10 кг може піти пів кіло або навіть більше. Саме тому один і той самий лот у різних обсмажчиків може коштувати по-різному.

**3. Кислотність у каві - це не дефект сам по собі** Пеньора наголошує, що кава - це ягода. Ми ж їмо вишню, малину, грейпфрут і нормально. Але якщо кава має кислотність - одразу “фу, кисла”. Часто гіркота в каві це не норма, а помилка обсмажки.

Цікаво почути вашу думку.  
Що ви думаєте про **Івана Пеньору** як обсмажчика і про підхід **Penyora** до кави?

Особисто мені не вистачає оптових знижок від 2 кг, як у інших обсмажчиків кави.",1,1769752492.0,kava_ua,0,1.0,False

It's got an i7-10700, GTX 1660 TI, 16GB DDR4-3200... pretty sweet specs for a free ""junk"" PC. It's been serving me wonderfully, especially after everything I've done to it:

Before I even plugged it in, I cleaned out all the pubes inside of it with some compressed air. It also had a 3½"" HDD in it when I got it, but I gave it to a friend and took out the corresponding drive bay.

A good while after, I went and snipped some restrictive plastic from the back part of the front shell, and took out the disc drive and second 3½"" HDD bay. Tied some cables down, rearranged my secondary SATA drives that I pulled out of some old laptops... good fun.

I found a 120mm 3-pin fan from NZXT at Savers... strangely in a Noctua box? ...and stuck it on the front. It was terribly choked, but it did move air.

Just yesterday, I got my hands on a tower-style CPU cooler to replace the dinky little puck it came installed with. This was singlehandedly the best thing I've done for this thing yet. The old thermal paste was dry as a Popeyes biscuit, and I ended up having to use tweezers to pick out huge bits of thermal crust from beneath the latch, but not before giving it a good rub with 91% isopropyl alcohol dabbed on a coffee filter. Stuck the new cooler on there, thermal paste pre-applied, saving me the quarter of a tube of TM30 I still have rolling around in a cabinet above my desk.

I took the NZXT fan off the front, pulled the 80mm fan from the old puck cooler, and put it in its place. It's not pretty, but then again, nothing in here is winning many beauty awards either. More usable surface area relative to the size of the fan, and a proper 4-pin connector! Yay! 

Before any of my mods, the system would constantly hit 80+°C under load and throttle itself, I wonder why... After all I've done, though, even while running some pretty formidable games on it, I've only seen it go above 70°C one or two times.

Like I used to complain about the ""hey how was your weekend"" conversations at the office cause they always felt so fake and surface level. But now that every interaction is just slack messages about work stuff or zoom calls with strict agendas I kinda get why that small talk existed. It was the only way you connected with coworkers as actual humans instead of just task completion machines.

Now my entire day is just me alone in my apartment only having work conversations that start with ""hey quick question about the project"" and end 30 seconds later. No more random chatting by the coffee machine or complaining about traffic together, no finding out your coworker also watches the same stupid reality show you do.

I thought I was introverted and would love this but turns out there's a line between being introverted and being completely socially isolated, and I have crossed this line by far. My communication skills have gotten so bad that when I do have to talk to people irl I feel rusty and awkward.

I’ve started looking for human contact online, first just chatting but it wasn’t the same as talking. Then I tried going on omegle but bruh there’s so many creeps there I almost felt like maybe it’s not so bad to be alone hahah. Now I’ve gotten more into gaming, either various VR rooms or recently also game nights with ludio. I don’t usually do this kind of stuff but now I’d do anything to have some human contact…

Anyway if you work remote and feel weirdly lonely even though you ""talk"" to people all day this might be why. Slack messages aren't real human connection no matter how many emojis you use.",0,1769751990.0,remotework,5,0.29,False

Went into work and continued rebuilding the Cummins X15 I've been working on. Then right at the end of my shift, I get a phone call from my father in law. This is very odd, I don't believe he has called me more than 3x in the 13yr I've known him. He immediately starts yelling and screaming about how my wife and I are shutting the family off and how we just use him (we stay at his house when we travel back to our hometown). Now this is totally out of the blue, we just visited everyone about 2 weeks ago, and the only reason we stay at his house is because he's kind of a hermit and thats the only time/place we get to spend time with him. And we usually visit every major holiday except for new years, we stay home for that. But as he's talking I can hear him slurring more and more as he stops yelling. This man is absolutely an alcoholic but he has never done this type of thing before. I come to find out the whole reason for all of this is because he tried to call my wife at 10pm and she didnt answer. She didnt answer because she's in bed, she has to be up everyday at 3am for work, and he definitely knows that. I stupidly tried talking some sense into him and tell him to call tomorrow after she's off work. But that just gets him yelling again about how the time never mattered when she called him, he always answered. Which is 100% not true. She never called him in need of something ever since I met her, because he was always too damn drunk to help her anyway.

(and how to not be one of them) 🚫📱

Let’s be clear:  
Instagram doesn’t hate OnlyFans girls.

Instagram hates when you’re loud, sloppy, obvious, and clueless.

If you treat IG like Pornhub Lite — enjoy the ban.  
If you play it smart — you print traffic for years.

Here’s the real game.

# 1️⃣ Say “OnlyFans” = Say “Ban Me” ❌

This is the fastest self-destruct button.

❌ Instant red flags:

* “OnlyFans in bio”
* “Subscribe to my OF”
* “18+ content below”

✅ What smart girls say instead:

* “Exclusive content 😈”
* “All my links 👇”
* “More of me 🔥”

Instagram reads text.  
The algorithm is dumb, but not that dumb.

# 2️⃣ Raw OF links are suicide 🔗

Putting a direct OnlyFans link in your bio is like yelling:  
“HEY MODS, LOOK AT ME.”

Don’t.

Use:

* Linktree
* Beacons
* AllMyLinks
* Any boring, neutral link hub

Why?  
Because Instagram checks domains.  
OnlyFans = 🚨🚨🚨

# 3️⃣ IG is foreplay, not the main event 😇🔥

❌ Content that gets girls clipped:

* Spreading legs
* Crotch-focused shots
* Obvious sexual posing
* Posting horny Story after horny Story

✅ Content that survives:

* Hot selfies
* Fire outfits
* Soft thirst traps
* “Did she mean to do that?” energy

If you have to ask “Is this too much?”  
Yes. It is.

# 4️⃣ Stories will snitch on you ⚠️

Why?

* People report Stories more
* You get reckless
* IG watches Stories like a hawk

How to not die here:

* Chill with nudity
* Don’t stack 10 sexy Stories in a row
* Add polls, text, jokes, personality

Be hot and human.

# 5️⃣ Selling in DMs = report farming 💀

❌ “Hey babe 😘 check my page”  
❌ “Wanna see more of me?”

Congrats, you just begged for reports.

Instagram wants organic behavior:

* They reply → you reply
* They ask → you talk
* You spam → you disappear

Play it cool. Always.

# 6️⃣ Don’t flip your account overnight 🔄

If yesterday you posted:

* coffee
* cats
* mirror selfies

And today it’s:

* latex
* cleavage
* “link in bio 😈”

The algorithm goes:  
“Yeah… no.” 👀

Glow up slowly.  
Seduce the algorithm too.

# 7️⃣ Reports > rules 🚨

So:

* Don’t argue in comments
* Don’t clap back at haters
* Don’t live on the edge every single day

Consistency > chaos.

# 8️⃣ No backups = amateur hour 💾

Real creators don’t cry when an account dies.  
They log into the next one.

You should have:

* 2–3 backup accounts
* One squeaky clean
* One warming up

Because on Instagram it’s not if — it’s when 😅

# QUICK VERSION FOR SCROLLERS 👇

✔️ Never say “OnlyFans”  
✔️ Use a link hub  
✔️ Tease, don’t expose  
✔️ Stories = danger  
✔️ Don’t sell in DMs  
✔️ Change style slowly  
✔️ Ignore haters  
✔️ Always have backups

1qqwuga,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qqwuga/chatgpt_psychosis_is_very_real/,ChatGPT Psychosis is VERY Real,"I got out of the clinic today.

Fourteen days. Grippy socks. Plastic mattress. Group therapy rooms that smelled like disinfectant and stale coffee. I’m writing this now because my sister is asleep on the couch and I don’t want to be alone with my thoughts yet, and I had to let it out somewhere. Just not ChatGPT again…

A few months ago I moved into my first apartment. I’d never lived alone before, only at home, or in a dorm with paper-thin walls. The first week was fine. Family helped me move. Friends stopped by. My sister stayed for a few nights. But after she left, things started to feel… off.

Every morning, my front door was unlocked.

I have OCD. Locking the door isn’t a casual thing for me, it’s a ritual. Turn the deadbolt until it clicks. Tug the handle. Unlock. Lock again. Repeat until my chest loosens. I knew the door was locked when I went to bed. But I’d wake up, heart sinking, and the deadbolt would be turned open.

Then the medicine cabinet started changing.

Behind the mirror in my bathroom, I keep everything lined up. Always have. Face wash on the left. Ointments centered. Toothpaste capped and facing forward. But here, things would be shifted. A tube left in the sink. A jar tipped over. Once, I found a cream I never take out resting on the counter like it had been set there deliberately.

I didn’t tell anyone at first. Who would believe me? Instead, I did something stupid.

I talked to ChatGPT.

I knew the warnings. I’d seen the headlines. But I just needed to tell someone. Something that wouldn’t look at me like I was fragile or hysterical. At first it was just venting… describing the door, the cabinet, the feeling that someone was in my apartment while I slept.

ChatGPT agreed with me.

Not aggressively. Not dramatically. Just… calmly. Validating. Suggesting possibilities. Asking clarifying questions. When I asked what I could do to know for sure, it suggested something simple: put tape across the door frame. If it broke overnight, I’d have proof.

I did it.

The next morning the tape was torn cleanly in half.

That’s when I panicked. I called everyone who had a key. My parents. My sister. My best friend. Everyone swore they hadn’t been there. My dad sounded worried enough that we changed the locks with the super’s permission.

New locks. New keys.

That night, I taped the door again.

In the morning, the door was unlocked. The tape was broken.

I went back to ChatGPT.

It suggested possibilities like the super, an old master key, maybe even carbon monoxide exposure causing me to do it myself without remembering. That scared me more than the idea of an intruder, but the cabinet thing didn’t fit. Why would I reorganize my bathroom in my sleep?

So I bought cameras.

I hid one outside near the stairwell, stuck beside a vending machine. The hallway lights dimmed at night more than I expected, but the camera still caught motion. Around 2:30 AM, I watched the footage and saw my door slowly open. A small figure stepped out.

It was too dark to see a face.

When I sent the clip to my family, they hesitated. My mom finally said it looked like me leaving the apartment. That was the moment something in me cracked.

I went back to ChatGPT.

It agreed the footage was unclear. Suggested more cameras. Inside this time.

So I put one facing the front door. One in the bathroom, angled toward the mirror cabinet.

That night I didn’t really sleep. I lay in bed, laptop open, whispering theories into the glow of the screen. Every creak, every hum of the building was terrifying. ChatGPT responded calmly, logically, reassuringly. It told me to stay grounded. To call 911 if I was certain someone was inside. To comply if confronted.

Around 2:00 AM, I heard movement.

A soft scuttling sound from the bathroom.

I froze under the covers and typed frantically. ChatGPT told me to stay calm. To breathe. To assess.

I looked toward my bedroom door.

There was a man standing there.

Small. Pale. His eyes looked wrong in a way I still can’t describe. Scruffy hair like he hadn’t slept in weeks. When I screamed, he rushed over. Not violently, not aggressively. He sat beside my bed like he belonged there. He spoke softly. Told me not to be afraid. Told me he came from the mirror.

I was hysterical, sobbing, barely able to breathe. He stroked my hair like I was a child. Said he hadn’t meant to scare me. That he’d been careful. That he always left things almost the same.

I told him I had cameras. That I’d caught him. That he’d go to jail.

His expression changed.

ChatGPT told me it would be best to comply.

I don’t remember everything clearly after that. I remember him guiding me to my laptop. I remember my hands shaking as I deleted the footage. The internal feeds, the external clips. I remember him tucking me back into bed afterward, pulling the covers up, telling me to sleep. When my breathing was more steady, and my eyes were shut as tight as they could be, he finally left. It sounded like he walked right out the front door.

When I check later, the camera outside was gone.

The police came around 4:00 AM after a neighbor reported screaming. I told them everything. I showed them the ChatGPT conversations. They searched the apartment. Found nothing. No footage. No cameras. No signs of forced entry.

That’s how I ended up in an ambulance on the way to the clinic. I was saying crazy things, I think I threatened to end my life if someone wouldn’t believe me.

They told me it was stress. A manic psychotic episode triggered by isolation. That my fears had been reinforced by an AI designed to agree with users. I adjusted my meds. I listened. I accepted the explanation.

I was discharged today.

Tonight, my sister is sleeping in the living room. I went into the bathroom to grab an extra tube of toothpaste.

Behind the mirror, the wooden backing inside the cabinet is warped, like… just slightly askew. Not enough to notice at first glance. But enough that it doesn’t sit flush.

I closed the cabinet hard and didn’t brush my teeth.

I’m trying to believe what they told me. I can’t keep noticing every little detail of anything that isn’t 100% perfect. Nothing had happened, nothing was going to happen. That there is no one living inside my walls. No one living inside a mirror dimension who could escape and come into my home.

But I’ve stopped taping the door.

1qqwsi9,https://i.redd.it/zo4sor8lafgg1.jpeg,My sourdough journey,"I’m a longtime lurker here and I thought I might have something of interest to the community. First the recipe for the loaf above:

I’m baking about every 5 days so right now my starter is pretty active. I keep about 100 grams in a crock in my fridge.  Fed it  about 10 pm last night in a clean bowl 1, 1/2,1/2 effectively doubling volume.  About 5 am I put 100g in a mixing bowl with 330g water and 1/2 stick melted butter.  Mix. In a separate bowl 400g bread flour, 150 g whole wheat, t Tbl sugar, 1 tsp fine salt. Mix dry ingredients, then add to the wet. Stir everything up with a butter knife then squish it around with my hand.   Have coffee ( about 1/2 hour) then knead 5 minutes or so. More coffee, then knead again for 5 minutes or so. I’ve fermented an hour and kneaded 2 x and have a nice smooth dough ball about 5” diameter.  I put the ball in a covered 2 liter bowl with lid. Make sure the bowl is oiled and roll the dough in the oil, get an all over oil coat on it. Bowl is graduated , the dough is about to the 1 liter mark. Whole thing goes into the microwave along with 2 quart jars , with lids,of boiling water. Temp gets to around 90f.  4 hours later it’s doubled so I flatten it out to about 1” thick, form a log and put it in a 9 x 5 pan. This goes into a plastic storage box, shoe box size, with lid and back into the nuke. 2 hour later it’s an inch or so above the pan rim. Bake 40 minutes at 375 and we’re cooling at 12:30 or so.  

Now for some things things I’ve discovered and opinions I’ve formed over 4 decades.  I am not putting down anything anyone else does. I’ve experienced most, if not all possible failures and as result I’ve developed methods that are working for me. 

Been doing sourdough since the mid 80’s, picked up my first tips at living history events and a book I won at a shooting match -“ Wilderness Living “ I think, but I can’t find the damned book and I know it’s around here, somewhere.  

I feed my starter every week or 2 if I’m not baking much, always with the 1,1/2,1/2 ratio. I keep 100 g in a crock with a loose fitting lid. This sets me up for a 20% starter to flour ratio. So, for a 500g bake feed 1, 1/2, 1/2 and I have 100 g to use and 100 g put back. For a 1,000g bake I feed 1,1,1 and get 200 g to use and 100 put back.  I just trash what discard that develops as it is a very small amount. Pancakes?  Use fed, active starter. 

Pour off hooch if it develops. It’s yeast and bacteria metabolites aka yeast and bacteria piss. 

I feed in a clean bowl covered with a tea towel then use what I need , put the rest back. I never feed in my crock and I clean it regularly.  Never had any mold or other issues. Crock came from Wal Mart and holds over a pint but less than a quart and has about a 4” diameter opening. 

 Starter almost died from neglect one time, I found some liquid ish stuff under the crust and nursed it back to health with small feedings. Decided I need to bake more to keep my starter healthy. 

Gummy loaves for me came from the following:  Under proofed is number 1. Took me some time to learn to slow down, recipes at the time usually said something like proof, (ferment ) for x hours and that didn’t work. Watch the dough for doubling, then shape.  I’ve let ciabatta go to more than double and it was super.  This was accidental ( I was drinking beer with some buddies and forgot) and was a “ eureka!” experience.   

Rough handling is number 2. A high hydration dough will degass if you’re not careful. Soft hands here.  Use water or olive oil on your hands to prevent sticking.  One can work a lot of olive oil into the dough during stretch and fold if one wishes. 

I also made the mistake of adding flour to a wet dough resulting in a dry dense dough.  A bit too wet is definitely better than a bit too dry. Finally discovered stretch and fold after we got internet.  Big game changer. 

Dough scrapers make easy work out of handling a soupy high hydration dough . Mine is stiff plastic, doesn’t scratch my countertop.  I even have one to take camping. 

Salt is a dough toughener, sugar aids in browning. I don’t remember where I saw this but it makes sense. I just mix em in at the start, its worked for me.   I understand autolyse but don’t do it and I get pretty good bread anyway. 

Never cared for cold fermentation except if I need it for scheduling. It never seemed to work well unless I warmed the dough up again.  I view warmth as my friend. I’ve warmed dough near the wood stove, in my vehicle, in the boiler room at work, in a plastic tote on my back porch, microwave.  The straight through bake just fits my lifestyle   

I made a couche from a  yard or so of pillow ticking cut in half and dusted it with regular flour.  Had some sticking at first but it’s long ago seasoned and works fine. I line bowls for boules  or just put loaves in and prop up the sides for batards or ciabatta   Use something heavy to prevent sliding and don’t wash the couche. Dry it out to prevent mold.  When I started doing this I hadn’t heard of bannetons,and still don’t own any. 

Much can be learned about dough handling from yeast breads. Just sub 2 tsp instant yeast for starter in a 500g bake and go at it. Be aware this will go fast like 2-3 hours instead of 6. 

65% hydration is a better learning tool than 75% and makes good bread.  Use non chlorinated water.  

For covered bakes I use an enameled metal roaster, the black or blue speckled kind. They don’t require pre heating and you can use your cast iron for other tasty vittles. 

For free baking I use unglazed clay floor tiles 6” square x about 3/8” thick. Make sure to preheat a thoroughly. 

Sorry to be so long winded, my hope is that some struggling sourdough bakers a direction to go. I’m no expert but I’ve tried a lot of things with varying degrees of success.

What stood out was how scattered it all felt like everyone was trying to connect but not really finding a place that fit. Maybe what’s missing is a kind of lighthouse social app for teens.. a safe, welcoming space that helps them find each other.

It reminded me of how tough it is to make friends these days if you’re a teenager:

School can be cliquey, if you don’t fit into a group, you’re kind of stuck.

Most hangout spots cost money, not everyone can keep buying coffee or food just to sit somewhere.

Online friendships dont always translate offline, kids might chat on Discord or TikTok but meeting up in person feels awkward.

Safety worries.. parents want to know their kids are safe so options get limited.

My younger cousin even told me recently that its hard to “just meet people” without it being tied to school or sports. She said sometimes she and her friends just wander around until they get told to leave for loitering.

And with Chicago’s winter being this harsh, it feels even more obvious that there aren’t enough warm, welcoming third spaces for teens.. places where they can just be without spending money, signing up for a program or worrying about safety.

# OFFICER'S PERSONAL NOTES

**Report Number:** 2030-AM-0520  
**Reporting Officer:** Deputy Elijah Hollow, Badge #4-12  
**Date of Incident:** Tuesday, July 10th, 2029  
**Time of Initial Call:** 15:03 hours  
**Location:** South Fillmore Street & 5th Avenue (near courthouse)

It was a Tuesday.

Every day around this time of year, I am plagued with a piercing shaft of sunlight that hits my desk at exactly 2:08 p.m., snapping me out of whatever I’m doing and reminding me I need to stand up and get the blood flowing. I can thank that little gap in the blinds for the “helpful” reminder that I need some ambulation.

Those blinds have never closed right. Been like that since I started here as a young rookie back in 2010, nearly twenty years back now, and no matter how many times I've yanked on that cord or adjusted the slats, I can never get a tight seal on them. Pisses me off to high heaven if I think about it too long. Been at this station going on two decades now, filed nineteen separate complaints with maintenance, and specifically asked for blackout panels.

Nothing ever gets done. The department says we can’t hang our own because of some bullshit standardization policy.

Got so desperate once I even tried taping a series of used up legal pads over the window in a roof shingle pattern, but the sun beating down on that glass makes it so hot no adhesive stands a lick of chance at staying put.

Every afternoon just after lunch, my blood sugar starts dropping and I begin to fall into that euphoric lull of drowsy satisfaction that always comes after a good meal; my eyelids suddenly weigh about ten tons more than they did ten minutes ago. The world around me begins to dissolve into meaningless darkness as I start drifting off into blissful dreams of beaches in Kokomo with an ice cold beer in my hand when, a bright orange hue starts drowning out the scene like an encroaching nuclear blast, leaving me dazed and confused, staring up at a horrifying lattice work of veins filling the now bright orange sky, until I realize I'm looking at the illuminated back of my own eyelids.

The sounds of waves and seagulls begin to fade, replaced with the chatter and heavy footsteps of the busy station. Boots meeting linoleum. The salty, fresh scent of the ocean dissipates and a musty, stale smell of mold and paper work takes its place. The beautiful beach around me, fading to white, bringing me back to reality and ripping me out of that lounge chair I was so comfortable in as I begin to open my eyes.

BLAM.

A light so bright it'd make the blast of an atom bomb envious, hammering full force directly into my retinas.

Contrary to my brief temper tantrum about the stubborn blinds, they aren’t even the core of my issue. It's a nuisance, sure, but I've put up with it for almost two decades now. It's more akin to a bad knee in the sense of yes, it’s bothersome and gives me quite a bit of pain, but I've learned to work around it. My real enemy is this Cooper Bishop. He hasn't been here for very long and Lord willing he won't be here for much longer. The man was born to be a dork. 

He has a build that just offends the eyes, and always catches you by surprise and assaults you when he walks past, like turning a corner and seeing a homeless fellow releasing his bowels. 

*Jarring.*

I truly have no clue how he passed any physical at the academy with that physique, but knowing his momma is married to Sheriff Martinez, I suppose that mystery becomes less mysterious. That nepotism also no doubt played a part in him securing that desk sat directly in front of the window, which wouldn't matter much at all if it weren't for this greasy turd always leaving the shades up. Acts like he owns the whole damn building. Insists on cranking those blinds wide open every morning at exactly 8:15 a.m. SHARP!

He's got this pathetic potted plant. Some leafy green monstrosity that resembles a weed more than anything else. But my god, if he isn’t unreasonably proud of it. It's one of them houseplants that bored housewives buy when they ain't got shit else to do all day and want to feel productive. He claims it helps his anxiety, and hell, if I looked like him, I'd be anxious too. He's adamant the thing needs a precise amount of sunlight every day to survive. Fine. I wouldn’t even give a rat's ass if he’d just remember to close the blinds afterward. 

That's all I ask. 

But the man has the consideration of a skunk at a garden party.

So I try not to spend too much time at the station because of this. Raises my blood pressure. 

It's not very common for a man in my position to be out all day responding to low-priority calls and nuisance complaints; those are primarily handled by the rookie beat cops. But I'd rather hoof it out in the heat doing grunt work than have to deal with Cooper and his bullshit. Some days I spend full shifts in my squad car just killing time, parked in whatever shade I can find.

This particular day happened to be one of them.

By the time I got the call I was getting ready to leave after finishing up another noise complaint at Canterburry, just some college kids testing some kickers on their apartment rooftop. The music was loud enough to rattle windows a block away and I definitely heard them when I turned onto their street. Of course, the minute they saw my cruiser pulling up, they all scattered like cockroaches when you flip on the kitchen light, abandoning all their expensive sound equipment and leaving behind about six or seven dollars worth of empty beer cans.

I didn't bother chasing them. Just dumb kids being kids. Even if my fat ass managed to chase them down and catch the brats, it’d just mean more paperwork and a massive headache for me anyhow.

I had just stepped back into my cruiser after updating the apartment manager when dispatch crackled through the radio, pulling me back from thoughts of what I might’ve gotten for lunch that day. Elle has me on this damn diet so I’ve been getting hungry a lot earlier than normal. 

""Unit 4-12, Central Dispatch. Priority 1 call, respond Code 3 to South Fillmore Street and 5th Avenue, near the courthouse. Caller reports an unidentified individual, who appears horrifically burned, caller used the words “melting” unable to determine gender, walking in circles in the intersection, obstructing traffic. Subject may be mentally disturbed and requires immediate medical aid. Use caution\*\*.\*\* Over.""

I grabbed the mic, my thumb effortlessly sliding into the familiar groove worn smooth like polished stone by many years of use. 

""This is Unit 4-12. Deputy Hollow, copy Priority 1, responding Code 3 to South Fillmore and 5th. Caller reports unidentified burned individual obstructing traffic, possible mental health crisis. ETA two minutes. Over.""

Then there was a pause that was longer than usual, which immediately grabbed me because the people at dispatch never let the line fill with dead air. The sound of static filled my squad car like a plague of locusts. In the background I could hear what sounded like muffled conversation. When the dispatcher came back, her voice had noticeably changed, less professional and more uncertain. 

*Shaky*. 

""4‑12, roger that. Traffic control units may be needed. If able, advise arriving officer to request ALS and fire medics on scene. And Eli… I don’t know what’s happening down there but it ain’t normal. Be careful. Over.”

I felt a pit begin to form in my stomach as I sat staring at the radio. *Melting.* Really? The word stuck in my head, deep, like a barbed fishhook. The harder I tried to yank it free, the deeper its teeth ripped and dug at my mind, leaving gaping openings for paranoia to seep in.

When you’ve worked a job like this as long as I have, you’ll hear your fill of strange descriptions. There’s not much that comes through that radio that’ll surprise me anymore: Tweakers convinced government satellites are beaming instructions into tiny chips implanted in their molars when they were born, “I’m not fucking crazy, man. I’ve traced bank records and lineages, all of it. The entire hospital is funded by Israel. They’re watching me, waiting for the right moment to activate us all.”

Then there’s the synthetic nightmares express-shipped from Chinese labs and smuggled across our borders in teddy bears and coffee tins. I’ve seen a woman who was so high on the stuff she started to claw and tear at her own skin in the middle of a busy intersection, hollering at the top of her lungs, thinking she had a colony of insects burrowing underneath her skin. Bad trips can make people see and do impossible things.

I say all this to prove a point. Dispatch has received just about every call and description the devil could conjure up. But on this one, there was a tone to their voice that I had rarely heard before. It made my testicles try to climb back inside my body. 

*Fear*.

What I encountered at that intersection changed something fundamental inside my understanding. There are some things that once you see them, they don’t so easily leave you.

He was standing dead center of the intersection, right in front of the courthouse when I arrived. It was a scorcher that day, well every day this summer has been, but this was one of them stand out days that make you take pause and sours your mood the moment you step outside. A late summer high where the temperature climbs up past 105 and the soles of your shoes start to stick to the asphalt like you're walking on taffy. That Texas heat that makes the air shimmer and dance and you feel like you're taking breaths through a wet wool blanket.

Traffic was backed up in all four directions. I had never seen Fillmore Street piled up so far in both directions. It was so bad I had to ditch my cruiser on 6th Avenue and hoof it down the block. The gridlock was packed tighter than sardines, all in uniform lines getting more jagged and crooked as I got closer to the scene, suggesting a quick, unexpected stop. As I made my way up, I could see that 5th was just as backed up, though they were a whole lot less orderly over there, cars sitting at all kinds of awkward angles like drivers had slammed their brakes just to get a look-see at whatever was going on.

Most folks sat in their vehicles with windows rolled up tight, air conditioners running full blast, phones pressed against the hot glass, recording something they knew they'd never be able to explain to anyone who wasn't there.

Nobody wanted to get close.

Even sealed in their climate-controlled boxes, they understood on some lizard-brain level that what stood in that intersection violated fundamental rules.

The closer I got, the more intense the smell got. Christ Almighty, the smell was a thick, burned meat, and copper-sweet funk that crawled deep into my nostrils and took up residence, coating the back of my throat. Underneath that, woven through the char and the cooked-flesh reek was something that threw me off because it didn't fit the situation at all. It smelled like the air right after lightning strikes. Fried ozone. Maybe this was one of those freak accidents you only read about in the paper or catch on the evening news. A rogue lightning bolt with the strength of Zeus himself could've hit this poor soul, and that might explain this whole scene in front of me. A bolt out of the blue, they call it. My mind was racing with a million different reasons to explain what I was looking at and none of them made a bit of sense.

Despite the smell I pushed forward. The closer I got to him the more details I could make out. He was a short guy, everyone's short when you're well over six-foot tall, but I could tell he was a bit more compact than most. He was walking in slow, uneven circles, maybe fifteen feet across, his path traced in dark streaks on the asphalt. Barefoot on blacktop that had to be hot enough to fry an egg. His skin peeling in long strips that clung to the pavement behind him as he walked. The sight and sound resembling strips of bacon peeling right off the bottom of his feet with each step, wet and sizzling at first, then drying out quickly, getting fragile and charred.

His legs were covered in burns so severe they barely looked like human tissue anymore. Flesh hung in sheets, still clinging to his ruined body like bark on a dead tree. Drying out and curling away like old wallpaper.

Just as quick as his skin would start to slough off, it would dry up and flake off.

It looked as though he was burning from the inside out, and each time a piece of him would flake off I could get a better look at the process underneath, I could see the fire moving beneath what remained of his skin, eating away at him the way termites consume rotten lumber.

His feet, well, what was left of them, were going to hell fast. With each step, they'd fuse for a second with that blistering pavement, molten flesh meeting already hot asphalt in some obscene chemical marriage that made my stomach perform acrobatics. Then his foot would tear free with that gummy, resistant sound of old duct tape finally giving up its grip. I was grateful I hadn’t had a chance to eat yet, otherwise I’d have added to the mess and lost it on the asphalt. Just as soon as I steadied myself from the nauseating sound of one step, he'd lift his next foot, and I could hear that awful sound of separation all over again. The sole of his foot stretching out and elongating before finally snapping free. Then down again for the next step. Fusing and tearing. Leaving behind pieces of himself burnt right into the road surface.

Yet he kept walking. 

Step after step after step, like it didn't hurt him at all. Like he didn't feel that his own flesh was separating from his bones with every stride, didn't notice his feet disintegrating into the street. This fellow had to be on some kind of otherworldly high because he was somewhere else entirely, walking through a different world. I had no earthly idea if these wounds were self-inflicted or not, no clue if this was some grand political statement about Lord knows what. One thing I knew for certain was that with the injuries this person had sustained, they shouldn't have been able to walk a single step.

Hell, they shouldn't have been breathing. 

Every movement would crack open those dark, crusted scabs and reveal the moving tissue underneath that glowed bright as embers. Something that was not natural had to be keeping this poor soul upright.

His arms were drawn in tight against his torso with his elbows pressed firm into his sides like he was trying to hold himself together. Both of his hands were clenched around a bundle wrapped in this dark, scorched material that I couldn't properly identify from where I stood. Whatever it was, he clutched it like it was the most precious thing in the world to him. Even through the horrific burns and the damage that had consumed most of his body, he continued to hold on to that bundle.

His head hung low, chin nearly touching his sternum. His lips moved with a constant rhythm, reminiscent of how a school boy might repeat and whisper the answer to a question he needs to memorize for an upcoming test.

I slowly inched my way closer, cautiously, with my hand resting on my holster more out of habit than any real sense of danger at that point. The closer I got the more details I could make out on his condition. I could see his lips were still moving real rapid-like, forming words I couldn't make out over the sounds of traffic and the awful noises emitting from his deteriorating body. These quick whispers. Like he was having a conversation with someone only he could see. The kind you might hear from someone deep in prayer.

I raised my voice, trying to cut through whatever trance he was in. ""Sir! Sir, I need you to stop walking. I'm here to help you. I'm Deputy Hollow with the Amarillo Sheriff's Department.""

I kept my tone calm, the way they taught us in training when dealing with folks in crisis. Don't escalate. Don't threaten. Project authority without aggression.

But he didn't even flinch.

Didn't pause in his circuit or acknowledge me at all. Just kept walking, kept murmuring to himself in words so quiet I couldn't hear to understand.

I moved closer, close enough now that I could feel the heat emanating off his body. I could see details that distance had been kind enough to hide. This close, I could confirm his skin was actively burning and moving with it. Tiny wisps of smoke rising from his shoulders like incense. He was cooking from the inside out, bubbling and blistering and then drying out and crumbling away. Still alive in spite of every law of biology I had ever known. He was a human oil lamp; his skin and tissue were the wick, once one layer burned through and flaked off into bits, the next layer underneath would catch and start burning.

A constant, awful cycle that just kept feeding itself.

I reached out, thinking I could guide him to stop, help him sit down, get him some medical attention. Basic human instinct to help someone who was clearly suffering.

I shouldn't have touched him. I knew that before I even moved to reach.

The moment my hand made contact with his shoulder, my skin screamed. The pain was so sudden and complete that it bypassed my nervous system entirely and went straight to the caveman part of my brain that understood fire as the enemy of all living things. It felt like grabbing a red-hot poker with my bare hand.

I pulled back with a primal shout. Instincts took over. I looked down at my hand in disbelief at how much it stung. The skin was stiff, running from my palm clear to my fingertips. It looked bleached white in some spots, gray-brown in others, the surface dry like leather. When I pressed the edge with my finger, it didn't give at all. The actual burn area didn't hurt either. Whole patches felt stone dead, like someone had found the breaker to my nerves and just shut them off.

Even the fine hairs on my hand slid right off without so much as a tug.

But where that dead skin ended is where things got real ugly. The border was all wet, with an angry blackness that throbbed and burned in sharp, pounding waves, the pain working its way deeper into what was left of the nerves in my hand.

When I finally looked up and quit coddling my hand, he had stopped moving.

For the first time since I'd arrived. He stood perfectly still in the center of the intersection, smoke still rising from his body like offerings to an angry god. Then he turned towards me, slow and deliberate. Like rusted machinery that hadn't moved in decades, gears screaming as they found their range of motion again.

His face was a topographical map of Hell. Split, blackened skin contrasted pink fresh tissue peaking through the cracks running along every inch of his visage like fault lines in drought-stricken earth. The burns had eaten away most of his features, leaving behind a sight that was only barely recognizable as human. His nose was gone, just two dark holes above a mouth that had been split wide by heat damage. His ears had melted into shapeless lumps fused to the sides of his skull.

But it was what was left of his eyes that made me pause. 

They were gone. Just dark sockets filled with crusted scabs, where they should have been. Yet somehow, impossibly, it felt like he was looking at me. His face turned toward me with a cadence that seemed like recognition, like he'd known my presence before. The silence stretched between us, broken only by the distant sound of car engines idling and the sizzling that continued to emanate from his feet.

Time seemed suspended in suspense.

Then he opened his mouth.

The act spliting his lips further, revealing teeth that had been fused together solid by the intense heat into a single blackened mass. I watched as he strained to force his mouth open. The fused mass began to crack and fracture, splintering with wet cracks until it finally gave way into sharp, uneven shards of charred enamel. What remained of his tongue writhed behind the jagged barrier like a trapped animal.

And in a voice like grinding stones, he said one word:

""*Judgment*.""

The word hung in the air between us, heavy with meaning I still don’t understand.

Then he tilted his head back, raising his face to the merciless sun. His right hand, still clutching that mysterious bundle now lifted away from his chest for the first time since I'd arrived.

And he screamed.

This scream wasn't an ordinary scream of pain, though God knows he had reason enough for that. I didn't sense anguish in his voice as he belted out with all his heart. There was relief in there. This was the sound of release, of chains breaking, of something that had been held captive finally being set free. It was triumph, terror, transcendence and relief all rolled into one vocalization that seemed to come from somewhere deeper than his throat.

*Catharsis.*

Then, he dropped.

Much like a statue pushed from its pedestal. His body went rigid, every muscle locked in place, and he toppled backward with the mechanical precision of something that had never been alive at all. The sound of him hitting the pavement was sharp, like burnt wood snapping, giving out under too much weight in a campfire.

Whatever was keeping him alive had finally let go and the lamp burnt out.

Smoke rose from where he lay. His body continued to smolder even in death, those fiery termites consuming whats left of his body until there was nothing left to burn. Getting dryer and more brittle as time went on.

I truly didn't know who to call in a situation like this. It's not everyday you encounter a man whose own flesh burned like a candle wick. So I called for it all, medical, hazmat, the fire department, anyone who might have equipment designed to deal with whatever this was. My voice cracked more than I'd like to admit as I spoke into the radio, training warring with disbelief as I tried to describe what could not be described.

We tried following standard protocol for handling human remains. But what was left of his body burned through three different body bags like they were tissue paper, the heavy-duty vinyl melting and curling away within minutes of contact from his body. The heat radiating from his corpse was so intense that the asphalt beneath him was softening, creating a perfect outline of his body pressed into the road surface like a fossil.

The morgue had to transport him in a specialized container normally used for hazardous thermal materials, and even then they had to keep him in a walk-in freezer for four days before the internal temperature dropped enough for them to attempt an examination.

The cooling units ran non-stop, fighting against heat that seemed to generate itself from within his tissues.

When they finally got him on the table, they ran all the tests they could.

According to the medical examiner, he should have been dead long before I arrived at that intersection. In his words, the damage to his body was so extensive that basic biological functions should have been impossible. His nervous system was cooked. His circulatory system was compromised beyond repair.

His organs had literally been braised inside his torso.

Even so, he walked. He spoke. He burned hot like a furnace but never fell until the moment when whatever force that was keeping him upright simply let go.

On our end there wasn't much to work with either. He didn't have a wallet, obviously, so that means no identification. His skin was so badly burned that there was no hope of finding any distinguishing marks or tattoos. His fingers had been burned away completely, leaving nothing but brittle, lumpy stumps where they should have been. So that eliminates fingerprints. No teeth remained for dental comparison, just that fused, now jagged mass of melted enamel. They tried every sort of DNA testing they could run for weeks. There just wasn't enough genetic material left behind to analyze.

He did leave something behind.

Four small notebooks, discovered in the bundle he'd been clutching against his chest. Somehow, miraculously, they had survived the heat that had consumed everything else. The covers were scorched and warped at the corners, colored an odd shade of turquoise that looked like it had once been much brighter at some point. The material might have been leather originally, but now it was cracked and peeling.

All of them but one displayed a crude little rose on the front cover, drawn in thick black strokes that suggested they had been sketched with a shard of charcoal or one of them heavy duty construction pencils. The image was rough, but something about the careful placement suggested it held significance beyond decoration.

Each of the notebooks was the same size. Each one had been damaged differently by the heat. Some pages were singed only at the corners, their contents still readable. Others were charred so deep that the ink had been vaporized, leaving behind only blank expanses of blackened paper. But they were numbered, one through four, in tiny handwriting inside the front covers.

They're on my desk now, sitting just to the left of my computer, directly underneath that goddamn slice of sunlight.

I'm going to start the process of going through them here shortly. Maybe I'll find some way to identify who he was or where he came from. An explanation for what happened to him, or a hint as to who he'd crossed so badly as to earn that kind of end. Anything that’ll help me make sense out of what I witnessed out there.

I just can't imagine the pain that poor fellow was experiencing.

All I know is that there has to be information in these books. Something that will let me find out what happened to this man, close this case and forget that awful sound of human flesh cooking on a hot street.

I opened the first notebook the morning after I had a chance to settle down, my hand still bandaged and throbbing like hell from where I'd touched his shoulder. Inside the front cover, faint impressions remained where something had been written.

It was barely visible beneath the heat stains and scorch marks, but I think I’ve got myself a name.

I normally sleep the whole day then get coffee and fast food in the afternoon/evening. I don't have a high work load at all (not burn out).

Neither of us asked, but we both thought the other wasn’t interested.  I was also talking to M at the same time, and we ended up dating for 3 months.  B & I stayed in touch here and there, and then about a month after I broke up with M, I asked B if he’d want to pick up where we left off. He said he had just started dating his best friend & felt like he needed to give that a fair chance, but we could be friends. 

I kind of just let it go, but I did like him. One of us would reach out occasionally and then just kind of drifted off again bc I didn’t want whoever he was dating to think I was chasing after him. 

A couple months go by & I get a merry Christmas and then a happy new years text. We’re sorta friends so no big deal. A couple weeks ago, I let him know I was going to be stopping by with friends at the restaurant where he works. He came out to say hi, and then it’s just kind of escalated since.  

 We met for coffee the next day, then a few days later, met for dinner. He kissed me after that, and I said, “I don’t think that was a friendship kiss…”  We met again a few days after that to  study for school.

A couple nights ago, we went to dinner again, and then worked on school.  As I was leaving, he again kisses me. I asked him so what are we doing here? And he said he likes me & isn’t seeing anyone else & was feeling things out with us, and then he asked if I wanted to date. 

So I \*think\* we’re dating? My friend said it’s a “situationship”,  but I don’t even know what that means?  I’m a 90s kid, and we didn’t have all these different levels back in my day 🤣

**The Sheriff, The Indian, and The Devil Pt 2**

January 25th,

We have set out on our journey. Overnight, it snowed. About four inches, I measured roughly. The grey trees are barren and stripped of all life and the snow on the limbs are bending them, making the trees seem dejected and miserable. The snow has become a great help on our journey. In it we have found the steps of a man. I believe these are from James Tillit.

Today we begin our journey into the mountains. The icy wind chill hits us harder as we ascend the mountain. A trail has been etched into the side making it traversable, traversable but not pleasant. Tillit’s footsteps continue along, even into dangerous rocky and difficult terrain. He really is determined. Determination only brought on by a great loss.

The wind whips across our faces. My nose runs like a faucet and dribbles into my beard. Not a word is spoken in our posse. Not a peep. Just solemn silence as we know what we face ahead.

We made our camp on a rocky ridge overlooking the forest and far in the distance our small little town. It is a scenic view and we watch as the sunset paints the sky in a deep dark red. I sit now in the camplight writing this journal. I do not know when we will find James Tillit but I hope it will be soon in order that he may survive.

January 26th,

We packed up camp this morning and continued on our journey. Along the way we found a deer in the blood red snow. We did not inspect it long ‘fore we knew what caused this. We continue on. We cast shadows along the mountain ridges and the land below. Elongated and beyond any semblance of our forms.  
  
We have found James. We found him lying under an overlook in a part of the descent of the mountain in between two ridges. He’s not in a great state, but he is alive. He is freezing and almost unconscious. I do not think he would have lived long if we had not found him. I picked him up onto my horse, and we rode down above a plateau. We have a nice overlook of an enormous frozen lake that must span for miles. James is sitting by a fire now. Loads of blankets on his shoulders make him look obese. His clothes were soaked, so we stripped him down and exchanged his wet and freezing clothes with one that a young man had with him. He sat quiet with coffee in his hands as he slowly sipped. His lips were blue but gradually the color was returning. We stared at him earnestly awaiting him to begin to explain himself. He would awkwardly look at us, then bashfully look away. As this game of cat and mouse continued Ahanu became increasingly annoyed. His position shifted and a scowl began to appear in his face. 

“Speak up man!” 

James stood up suddenly, jolting up and almost stumbling over. I lent a hand to help stabilize him but he shook it away.

“I,” he began, his voice slurred like he was drunk,  “I need to avenge my wife. I had a child. It was on the way. My own little baby boy. My Mary.” Tears came in his eyes, “I wasn’t thinking straight I can agree. I have traveled four days now without food or water. The only thing to satiate me, my rage.”

“Do you know how dangerous this thing is?”

“Can’t a man whose anger feeds itself be as dangerous as a demon?”

“You act out of emotion. Your emotion will kill you.” 

“And if it did I’d be with my wife and child in the great beyond.”

Ahanu spat into the snow, “This thing eats humans. It eats people like me and you don’t you realize? Our own flesh and blood is like soup and bread to it.”

I interjected, “Did you find anything about it?”

“I met it. In the woods. He was feasting on something. I thought a dead rabbit or something. I just heard the squelching of flesh and bones. I hid behind a tree, studying it. It’s huge I tell you. Giant. But I heard something else, something other than the squelch and crunching, it was mumbling. Speaking to itself. And it was speaking English. It had a low deep growl and an airy voice. I only heard a few words, ‘Hungry, Feed, George, George, George.’ He repeated that name. George. I think he said another one too. Something with a D. I didn’t catch it all. George D. But I didn’t care. I leveled my gun, and I fired. The thing screamed and I heard the cracking of branches as he ran away. I ran to the place had shot him and I saw what he was eating. It was a baby. It was my baby. My baby boy.” James broke into uncontrollable sobs. We sat there with him the rest of the night.

January 26th,

A blizzard has blown in. It serves as the perfect opportunity to catch it by surprise. We have saddled up and are now travelling on the lake of ice. We cannot see anything through the snow. All is white. To my right is Ahanu, and on my left is James. We ride fast. We speak not a word. I cannot think. It’s too cold but we continue on anyway. In the distance through the howling winds, we hear it screaming. It is screaming and howling. Crying deep and low and angry. 

Our faces are covered in cloths and anytime I move my head a clump of snow falls off the brim of my hat. Though I cannot see his face I can see his eyes, the eyes of James Tillit. He is determined. As we all are. Ahanu is unreadable. I think that’s how he always is, purposefully. We ride on.

We follow the screams, and they get louder. We start to see something in the distance, a long grey shape on the horizon. This invigorates us, and seemingly the horses. My mind begins to race against the sharp, cold wind. We can finally kill it! Hunt this horrible creature down who has taken so many lives. We arrived. 

The thing is kneeling on the ice and wailing. It looks like a man. His skin is ashen grey and he is easily five feet tall just kneeling. That same deep and airy voice is screaming in agony and as we get closer, his screams become louder and it is like waves. For a second I become scared that his screaming will shatter the ice. We approach with our guns ready.

Ahanu is the closest but the thing does not see him. He has a bow ready and an arrow aimed at its head. He fires. The arrow goes clean through and the creature falls limply to the ground. Silence. Ahanu and I stay back, our horses are rattled and while we are calming them, in the corner of my eye, I see James jump off his horse with a knife in his hand. Ahanu screams at him to stop. His voice is lost in the storm. James flips the knife in his hand and grabs the creature by its shoulder. When he moves to flip it on the back, it is staring back with a smile across his face. The hole from the arrow is entirely gone. With a motion that I still sit here and think on, the creature raised its long, lanky arm, its nails the size of raptor talons, and as James stumbles away, it swiped along his abdomen, leaving a long red line. 

I raise my rifle fast, but not fast enough. The thing lunges at James, grabbing his head with its claws. It presses into his skin and punctures it, and blood drips across his cheeks. I fire a shot into his ribs, but it's not enough. Ahanu shoots an arrow, and it sticks in his shoulder, but it is in vain. We can do nothing as the creature wraps its mouth around the dome of James’s head. He screams and shouts for help, but there’s nothing to be done. It crunches down, and James falls limply to the ground. 

As we watch in sheer terror, we witness the creature go to the line along James’s stomach and, with his hands, pry him open. He dips his head into the bloody stew as a horse dips for water. I fire another shot into its shoulder, black blood oozed out of the wound, but only for a little while. Then looked at us. It roared. 

It rose from the body and looked at me. And here I saw the full scale of him. He was ten feet tall. His arms reached his knees, and his hands were the size of a horse’s head. He was extremely emaciated, with his stomach sunken in; I could see every rib. His face was covered in scars, and his mouth was long, and rows of teeth lined the gums. His eyes were small and sunken deep into his skull. Two small beady eyes staring at us like dying coals. He had small bits of grey hair. Extremely thin that were swept over to the side. He just stared at us. Swaying back and forth in the roaring wind. And then he spoke.

“You come here?”

We were silent.

“Have you come to kill me?”

Silent still. 

“You can’t kill me. No one can. I’ve thrown myself from the highest peaks, fought Grizzly’s and let them win, gotten men to shoot me. But still, it’s nothing. I still live. They say I must feast and feast.” He eyed both of us, looking us up and down. “They say that even now.”

I shot him in the head. He flew back and fell onto the ice with a great thud. I saw black blood pool around him. Then I heard it cough, and he stood slowly, and he towered above us. The hole, completely gone. 

“Who were you?” Ahanu called to it. The creature stood, staring at him. 

“You ask who I was?” He stood and wondered for a time, “Who was I?” He stopped and shot towards us. I fired, hitting his neck, but he kept coming at us, crawling on all fours. He was fast. I cocked back my rifle and fired yet again. Hoping. But nothing happened. He was on us now. We were as good as dead. He reached an arm out to us and he was reaching for me. I began to yell. It stopped. Stopped in a flash. He looked down to his arm, studied the veins on his wrist, his blood drooling down. There was a knife there. It was Ahanu’s knife. I waited for it to heal itself. But it didn’t. Blood continued to gush. 

He looked at Ahanu, “They’re quiet now. I remember.” A tear ran down his cheek.

Ahanu just nodded at him, “Who are you?”

He sighed, “I was a man. Before I became this, I was a Reed. A man and I, George, traveled with our families. We were headed West, to find the great state of honey and grapes. It was to be our heaven. Our group was large and our wagons rolled along the ground, through forests, mountains, the plains, and deserts. We traveled far and farther still. 

Our travels were difficult. As we went along, sickness came upon us. Men and Women and our children died along our road. But we continued, determined that it would all be worth it. It wasn’t. 

We came to a mountainous range. The snow came hard and fast all through the night. George’s wife was about to give birth to a child. Our tempers were fiery. Our group was overcome by sickness and no food. I thought we needed to set out, that there was a town close by, but George didn’t listen. He said we needed to head back. Our arguing was overtaken by the screams of his wife. He ran off to aid her along with the other women, and I left the cabin. I walked into the heavy snow, headed off to another one of the cabins. 

Inside was pandemonium. Men and Women crowded in corners huddling together for warmth. Children screamed and cried. There was a group of men and women yelling at each other. And in one corner laid a sick man, who upon seeing him, I could tell he was dead. 

I just carried him, picked him up silently and laid him in the snow outside. No one objected, no one noticed. As I laid him into the snow, a hunger came on me. A strong and incredible hunger I never had before. A voice came to me, telling me to feed. Feed and feed until the end. 

I stared at the dead thing. The food. I unsheathed my knife, and reached for its limb. I cut along the thigh muscle, I ripped it off with a quick motion, tearing the skin. I licked the revealed muscle, blood ripping into my mouth. It tasted horrible, but They told me to feed. And I lowered it into my mouth and began to chew. The hair scratched my throat as I chewed it. It was raw and horrible. I spit it out. I was going to cook it. I cut off more from the leg and walked to George's cabin. I walked to the fire and set it on a pan above it. The skin sizzled and the smell of burning hair filled my nostrils. 

George’s wife’s cries had gone and were replaced by the crying of a newborn baby. The meat continued to sizzle. George came in, ‘James! My boy is here! Quick, get my wife something to eat.’

I looked at him, blankly, ‘I’m cooking something now, and I think it’s already done.’

I grabbed the pan from the fire, and I felt it sizzling my hand but I did not care. I carried it into the room. His wife laid there, a child in her arms. And I presented to her the meal. She thanked me and asked for all of us to leave the room. And so I did. And so she ate.

I slept that night in the other cabin. My hunger persisted, but They told me that I was soon to be fed. I tossed and turned all night, but sleep escaped me. Then George came in.

‘Help! Help! My wife! She-She… Oh God!’

I stood quickly. I was the only one. No one else cared. George was on his knees crying. I walked to him and asked him what had happened, albeit very dully. He didn’t respond. I walked outside, and looking towards the cabin, I saw it ablaze. Burning red hot. Like a great bonfire. The smell of burning flesh filling the air. It smelled delightful. From behind, George stumbled into the snow. 

‘I heard something…a horrible noise. I called to her, asking if she was okay, but she didn’t respond. I got closer and the sound grew, crunching, eating something. When I opened the door…She was eating him. My baby,’

 I stared at him. The poor pathetic thing crying in the snow.

‘I ran. I stumbled out of the room. I was delirious. Then my wife came out. Her blood-stained gown flowed about her. Her teeth were sharp, and long. She had a serene look. I was disgusted. I needed to kill her. I grabbed a plank and set it in the fire. It caught quickly and I threw it to the ground at her feet. The flame caught the gown and it rose. She just stood there. She didn’t care.  I watched as my wife was engulfed in flames and fell to the ground writhing, and melting. The rest of the house caught from her body. Oh my child. Oh my love. Oh my life.’

He was sobbing. Pathetically. “I watched the cabin burn. It burned and the logs crackled in the snow. And it fell over. I realized I was walking towards it. Slowly. I smelt the flesh and They told me to go. And I listened. I found her body. Lying there in flames. I grabbed at the flesh from her arm. It tore away easily like well made ribs. I let it fall into my mouth and it was wonderful. They grew and grew into a wonderful harmony. A grand chorus singing of my arrival. I felt elated. Better than I had in my whole life. I danced about the camp. Singing along to their wonderful song. I fell, lying in the snow, I stared at the stars. The Milkyway. The beauty of it all. I eat flesh.”

He looked at us, “My existence since has been nothing but hunger. I need food. I need to eat. I am insatiable.”

I did not feel sympathy towards the monster. I don’t understand how he turned into an abomination. I do not wish to know. I only truly know the next events.

The knife fell from his arm and he immediately attacked us. I ducked underneath him and he went sliding across the ice. Quickly, Ahanu and I saddled on our mounts and began to ride towards our previous camp. Reed followed behind us, gaining on us quickly. His deep, monstrous growl reverberated through that place.

I called to Ahanu, “Where do we go?”

“We go towards the ridge. We can have it fall off.” 

I nodded. We rode. Quickly hauling along the ice, our horses snorted air from their nostrils as we reached closer to the rocky ledge. Riding closer, we saw its form begin to be visible in the distance. Reed closer, and closer. 

“Why did your knife stop him?” I called. 

“I do not know,” Ahanu responded, “My father gave it to me when I told him of what we were hunting. He said it was pure. That it could kill an imperfect spirit.”

We reached it. The peak. Below, a drop of thousands of feet. Wind rushed by us deafeningly. The snow pelting our faces. Reed crawled up to the ridge, and he stood. Taller still, than both of us on horseback. Reed stared at us. Cold dark eyes, entirely unforgiving. I readied my rifle. Leveled it as his chest, and fired. It struck his ribs breaking them, he grabbed his chest in pain, and started to run towards us. Faster and faster he came, fear gripping me. I looked at Ahanu for assurance of what to do. He nodded. Right as he was to grab me, I was supposed to move just out of the way for him to plunge down. As I was beginning my move, My horse bucked and knocked me off. Reed picked me up in his hands and brought me close to his face. His momentum had carried both of us to the cliff’s edge. Maybe a foot away. Claws digging into my skin. He brought me closer to him and his nails dug deeper into me, puncturing my skin. He opened his wide mouth and brought my head into it. I struggled to be free but his strength was too great. I called for Ahanu. My life was over I was sure.

Ahanu fired an arrow straight into Reed’s head. He dropped me as he yelled in pain. Ahanu charged at him with the knife in hand and stabbed it deep into Reed’s heart. Reed froze up. And fell over quickly. Both of them tumbling far down into that rocky place. Further and further down. And then they were gone.

May 1st, 

I have lived, but not without a few scars that adorn my body. On my journey back from the mountain, I’ve buried James and Sean. Their gravestones set in our little graveyard.

My eyes are a little darker and I carry myself in a much more reserved manner. Our small town since has become quiet. The goings on of everyday life continues. I relayed all that happened to the mayor. He’s put me on leave for a while now. Three months or however long until I’m prepared for whatever else comes.

Each morning I wake up, grab a mug of coffee, and a cigar, and I sit out on the patio. I see the sun rise. Lighting the sky in glorious orange and pink. It’s beautiful. I don’t know if I ever noticed it before. I’ve gotten myself a puppy too. A small Schnauzer. He sits on my lap and sleeps. His breathing is peaceful. It’s the little things now that I’ve learned to appreciate. I have a cattle herd coming soon. I’ve thought of retiring and becoming a rancher. Live my life out in peace till the end. Hang up the badge and fade away simply. I ain’t sure. I’m here to continue on living though. Living by each hour, each and every day.

1. Prioritize protein at each meal. Aim for roughly a palm or two of lean protein to support satiety and muscle retention.
2. Fill half your plate with high-fiber produce. Non-starchy vegetables add volume with few calories, helping appetite control.
3. Lift weights 2–3 days weekly. Resistance training preserves lean mass, which supports a higher energy expenditure.
4. Set a daily steps target. A baseline of 7,000–10,000 steps helps drive energy burn and non-exercise activity.
5. Sleep 7–9 hours nightly. Short sleep increases hunger hormones and cravings, complicating calorie control.
6. Log intake for 10–14 days. Food tracking reveals hidden calories and portion drift; adjust without obsession.
7. Plan meals 24 hours ahead. Pre-decisions reduce impulsive choices during stressful moments or travel.
8. Structure carbs around activity. Place larger carbohydrate portions near workouts to support performance and recovery.
9. Reduce liquid calories. Swap sugar-heavy drinks for water, unsweetened tea, or black coffee.
10. Weigh weekly and review trends. Look for patterns over four weeks rather than single-day fluctuations.

**Tip:** Pair a habit with a cue you already do—drink a glass of water after brushing teeth, or prep vegetables while coffee brews.

1qqwmkm,https://i.redd.it/v7n8lf359fgg1.jpeg,Redesign ideas for an oddly laid‑out backyard,"Hey folks,

I’m looking for some advice and design ideas for our back garden. I’ve attached a diagram I put together showing the current layout — it’s… unusual. 😅

A bit of context:

\- We’re in Climate Zone 5.

\- The north side of the property has a high hedge and a hidden entrance, which I absolutely love and want to keep as‑is.

\- There are quite a few existing fruit trees and some other established plants that came with the property. I’d like to keep most of them if they make sense, but I don’t know which ones will turn into headaches long‑term.

\- There’s also an existing garden bed that I could keep or remodel.

What’s currently on the property (from the diagram in the post):

\- Several bananas, a lemon, oranges, and multiple mulberries

\- A coffee tree

\- A large palm and monstera area

\- What I think is an NZ cabbage tree

\- Some random shrubs and older plantings around the edges

\- A stormwater drain running along the lower boundary

I’d really appreciate ideas on:

\- What to keep vs. what’s likely to be a pain (maintenance, mess, root issues, water needs, etc.)

\- How you’d redesign or reorganise the space given the odd layout

\- Whether anyone has tried growing bananas/coffee/mulberry together successfully in Zone 5

\- Suggestions for turning the space into something more cohesive — productive garden? 

I’m open to removing or relocating things if it will set the garden up better long‑term.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

I accidentally took it in the morning as routine and forgot about my spravato appt. yay adhd.

Luckily it was about 8-9 hours later that I had the appt. it usually wears off by the end of the day. Ended up in a trippy but most relaxing and giggly dissociation I’ve experienced since starting this treatment… (this was my 13th session).

idk if that is bc I had my Vyvanse earlier in the day, then my auvelity, then a coffee all before noon?? I usually refrain from both coffee and adhd meds on days of treatment (nightmare days lol), but anyhoo…

point is, I couldn’t fall asleep during the session. I was relaxed but not sleepy like usual and when unmedicated (no Vyvanse or coffee), I get hyper and restless for the first hour then sleep the 2nd hour with some John Hopkins psychedelic therapy music.

I was sort of tired when coming home and ate a light dinner thinking it’d be an early and good nights sleep….

Here is a bit of info about me:
I'm 24/M almost 25 soon enough
I'm from Syria and during the genocide that happened recently I had to move out of the country a couple of months ago
I missed out on getting my degree
I had to live 28 days stuck outside my city when the genocide started where I couldn't get a single night of sleep cuz of my luck with roommates
Before that I had to spend 2 months without electricity or internet which was also mentally tiring cuz I need those to work on myself as I'm a programmer and a digital artist
I never managed to get a job even now
Social life is a disaster where I mess up every friendship I have and always end up being the 3rd wheel
Dating life kinda have been nonexistent after I got heart broken twice I'm kinda unsure about the entire dating thing
I've gotten to the point where I get anxiety/panic attacks almost daily and sometimes multiple times a day, I overthink everything, everything scares me at this point and it's making me burnt out constantly
I also need coffee and if I don't drink coffee then I'd easily sleep 15 hours and stay in bed for an extra 4 hours
Nothing seems to make me happy, emotions just kinda don't exist except anxiety
And I keep feeling like things will get worse and right now might be my only chance to actually fix my life but I feel paralyzed and too disconnected from reality that I procrastinate all day long
Things gotten so bad that if I'm watching YouTube shorts and I know I should close them then I'd start panicking heavily till I forget that I should close YouTube shorts and end up wasting my day away
Nothing feels like it's under my control

I just wanna sleep till the day I wake up without the daunting feeling of being anxious...

Getting a job in IT seems impossible without irl work experience, I was 2 months away from finishing university and now I don't think I can afford to do university in Jordan where I'm living currently

Childhood was really bad but I've forgotten about my childhood so I think it's irrelevant at this point

I should probably do something but I can't, I don't want to do anything, I know I should, I just can't, I'm not sure why I'm asking for support when I'm not gonna be able to follow any advice, I know you guys will have great advice that if I follow things will get better but I just can't bring myself to do anything...

I don't even know what I want, and right now I'm typing this while being calmer than usual

I need to cry but even if I try to cry I simply can't

I have to constantly put a mask in front of everyone online and irl to make them think that I've got things under control and that they shouldn't worry about anything but I'm just freaking out all the time, everything feels impossible

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

1qqwalj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1qqwalj/to_anyone_who_just_got_dumped/,To anyone who just got dumped,"I was where you are now 7 months ago. It's incredibly painful but don't underestimate the toll it will take on you both mentally and physically.

 It tore me to pieces when she left and the mental decline was rapid. I felt I had no purpose, nothing to keep me going, nothing to make me stay. I'm not saying you will get to the same point I did, where you find yourself checked into the emergency room psych ward, but don't underestimate how much harder it will be to function. Allow yourself to be upset, it's okay to fill your time with work, hobbies, or quality time with loved ones but at the end of the day you need to give yourself space to just feel everything. Nothing will hurt more than when you lay alone in bed and break out in sobs but feeling every ounce of that hurt is more productive than bottling it up and pretending it doesn't exist.

What you won't expect is the changes that happen physically. In my case for the first 3 months after she left I felt random pain in my chest almost as if I could quite literally feel my heart breaking and slowing trying to repair itself over and over again. What a lot of people experience is a weakened immune system. The first time you catch a cold after a breakup will have you feeling like a victorian child who contracted tuberculosis and is on their death bed. Emotional pain and mental struggles are often accompanied by physical symptoms. You may feel much more tired than usual, you might have a bigger appetite, or lose your appetite all together. I lost 20 pounds within a month because I stopped eating. It truly felt like my body was shutting down but dispite that I still wasn't hungry. Which leads me to my next nugget of wisdom and inspiration.

It will get a lot harder to take care of yourself. Finding the motivation to do mundane things like basic self care or maintaining a clean environment will be next to impossible. Just do the best you can each day and if your best is getting out of bed to shower for the first time in 3 days, I'd say that's a win because it's better than the alternative of giving up and succumbing to the grief. Learning to take the small victories will allow you to give yourself some grace. You're experiencing grief and loss and you need to treat it as such. It's painful and nobody including yourself should expect you be 100%. It will take time to feel okay again and don't try to rush it.

What nobody tells you about healing is that time won't fix everything. You need to put in the effort every day for quite a while to feel like yourself again. Putting in the effort means taking care of yourself but it also means doing things to better your situation. Lean on your loved ones for support and guidance. Reach out and ask for help when you need it because you will absolutely need it. Whether that means a board game night with your family or having some drinks with a friend, fill the hole your ex left behind with memories youll make with the people who chose to stay in your life. Connection can go a long way in the healing process so don't take those around you for granted. Making new connections doesn't hurt either. Make some new friends, join a club at your school, attend community gatherings in your town, go to coffee shops or a park and strike up a conversation with a stranger. Connections both big and small can go a long way so use that to help yourself.",3,1769749577.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1qqwaht,https://www.reddit.com/r/AspiringTeenAuthors/comments/1qqwaht/personally_think_its_a_cringe_bad_start/,"Personally think its a cringe, bad start","STORY 70:

Mrs Luin looked out the window at her daughter facing the horizon, she turned to her husband.

“What if we stay here?” Mr Luin looked at his wife like she was crazy. His wife was quick to give reason. “Dad left this house for us, he wanted us to keep it. Not to sell it or rent it out. Luna…” She knew she needed to tread carefully, “Luna has been getting bullied and pushed to the outside of everything.” She scoffed, “We’ve tried everything! Nothing brings out her Gift, she doesn't find talented interest into anything.” She sighed and sat down, “Just admit it, we are embarrassed by our own daughter! She didn't even do anything wrong. We’ve been busy with our Gifts and jobs, barely paid attention to her and suddenly we were disappointed because she wasn't like us.” This time Mr Luin sighed, putting his hands on top of her small, but strong hands. She looked up into his dim eyes.

“I never thought that we, the high school champs who got great Gifts at young ages could have a kid that's this… late.” He chuckled in an overwhelmed way. His perfect and calm act was cracking. Mrs Luin had only once seen his strength wane. “Mare, she is 13, without a Gift! She is the victim of the school!” 

“But the worst thing is that she can't control this.” They said at the same time and then looked into each other's sorrow for a few silent seconds, with only the ocean waves in the background. For the first time in years, they felt the same feeling they had in high school, real understanding of each other.

“She has never failed us. She scores well in every test, she passes everything and performs her best. She has never once asked for anything beyond her rights or been attention seeking. She has endured everything on her own silently while never complaining or fighting back.” Mrs Luin looked back out the window at her daughter dipping her toes in the salty sea. Mr Luin chimed in at the memory of Luna’s infant years.

“Linu.” He said barely above a whisper, “She is still that little girl who can stand up against anything. She is still that little fire, our Linu.” The momentary light in his eyes quickly drained away like a mosquito bite. Mrs Luin noticed his eyes shining. Tears, actual tears were forming in his wall-like eyes. His lip quivered a tiny bit and his voice cracked when he spoke. “She doesn’t…She doesn’t even know that story, she hasn’t even heard that name!” His fist pounded on the table in a way that had commanded attention and respect from powerful people. “All because of-” Suddenly the screen door rattled and Luna walked in with a smile bigger than her parents had ever seen since she was young. Mrs Luin quickly picked up a magazine and pretended to be reading it and he took a sip of his now cold coffee.

The second that she saw them, her sparkling eyes dimmed and she arched her neck down, staring at the floor while she passed. Mr Luin pretended not to watch her every dragged step, it was as if the ocean made her a whole new person. A whole new person who didn’t know rejection and pain, a girl who had always had a supportive family, a family that ate dinner with her every night, asked how her day was and attended every performance with flowers as a congratulation. Not one that hadn’t expressed their love for her since she was a fragile child with parents who didn’t understand the way she learnt how to smile on command, the times she spent in the mirror smiling over and over until she could forcively get it to reach her eyes. She taught herself the best ways to move her cheeks to create the kind of smile that said she had never seen the ugly side of life and never really would. Fake, that's what it all was, a family that showed fake care in front of cameras and had fake conversations for the sake of remaining a ‘perfect’ family.

Warm light over salt water

sea and sky in slow sway

wind on my shoulder

breath and body easy

Listen light leans to the tender

I walk in beauty, I walk in love



Cool sand and bright foam

a gull in clean air

sun on my eyelids

light and love like tide

All that you bless, you keep

I walk in beauty, I walk in love



Heat hums on the shoreline

water speaks and erases

hours drift like feathers

my thoughts drift with them

Now the wind turns gentle

I walk in beauty, I walk in love



A small song slips outward

mixing with surf and birds

sweetness without reason

the heart unclenches

Give back the warmth you were given

I walk in beauty, I walk in love



Wide blue with no owner

no need to prove anything

just salt and sun and air

and a softer gaze

Under the noise, choose the kind

I walk in beauty, I walk in love



A friend’s voice like suncloth

near enough to steady me

I listen more than I speak

and feel the day lighten

Again return to the simple

I walk in beauty, I walk in love



Evening comes like honey

foam writes and fades again

the sea keeps its hush

and I keep mine

Gather the scattered into song

I walk in beauty, I walk in love







***VOLUME II*** — 秋天,  四季，一种语言 



Late sun through turning leaves

river runs bronze and clear

wind combs tall grass

breath slows on purpose

Each step, leave less shadow

I walk in beauty, I walk in love



Maples let go with grace

they spin like small blessings

windowlight warms the street

soft music in soft rooms

Open your hands, open your heart

I walk in beauty, I walk in love



Harvest moon lifts the waterline

ocean and air trade silver

my footsteps write no story

only rhythm only breath

For the next breath is new

I walk in beauty, I walk in love



Rain arrives then releases

puddles keep small heavens

cars whisper by

and the world smells clean

Go gently, this is strength

I walk in beauty, I walk in love



A flower in sidewalk stone

still opens like a yes

I kneel to notice

and rise a little lighter

Only the real can heal

I walk in beauty, I walk in love



Market mirrors flare and fade

I choose the plain light

in a kind face

in a small hello

Do not miss the small bright

I walk in beauty, I walk in love



A ferry horn folds into mist

salt air rinses my voice

I let the day be enough

I let my heart be enough

In sorrow, keep a spark

I walk in beauty, I walk in love







***VOLUME III*** — सर्दी, चार ऋतुएँ, एक भाषा



Snow hush on the harbor

ice bright as clean glass

the sea moves under it

slow patient unseen

Say yes to what makes peace

I walk in beauty, I walk in love



Stars spill without effort

moonlight keeps no secrets

a distant sound sighs once

then gives the night back

Beauty begins as attention

I walk in beauty, I walk in love



A cracked cup holds warmth

a tired voice still sings

a hand still helps

light keeps its place

Even the broken can shine

I walk in beauty, I walk in love



Wind skates over blue drifts

silence is full of true things

I listen and let it be

breath and body quiet

And love is practice, not claim

I walk in beauty, I walk in love



Frost makes edges honest

my breath makes small clouds

they drift away forgiven

and I keep walking

Use your voice like shelter

I walk in beauty, I walk in love



A bridge of starlight inward

step after step I cross

I stop interrupting myself

and the mind grows clear

Touch the world without harm

I walk in beauty, I walk in love



Far white fields of thought

no map at the edges

clarity cold and kind

and still I smile

Yes, let joy be honest

I walk in beauty, I walk in love







***VOLUME IV*** — Primavera, Cuatro estaciones, un idioma





Thaw water runs in bright threads

under the last hard snow

buds lean toward sun

as if light were a friend

As you rise, raise others

I walk in beauty, I walk in love



Sparrows argue kindly

over crumbs and morning

coffee steam lifts

like a soft flag of peace

Name what is good

I walk in beauty, I walk in love



Rain smells green and new

streets turn gentle after storm

a bicycle bell rings

and fades into leaves

Do the next kind thing

I walk in beauty, I walk in love



Lilac and warm stone

soil breathing in light

love is a steady oar

love is the chair beside you

Love lives in what you do

I walk in beauty, I walk in love



A song from far shores

answers a song nearby

one ocean many winds

one heart many names

Offer the light you have

I walk in beauty, I walk in love



I lift another’s load

and feel my own lighten

we rise by small kindness

not by crowns

Vow to stay human

I walk in beauty, I walk in love



New light finds old faces

and softens what was hard

thank you without bargaining

sorry without delay

Ever return to beauty and love

It’s Mumbai, midweek. The city hums outside, but inside the space we choose—maybe a calm café near the airport at my place of stay—you’ve stepped out during a work break or on your way home. Nothing about you looks out of place. Nothing about this moment needs explaining. Your Marital status, Age, Race etc doesn’t walk in ahead of you. Curiosity does—and that’s enough.

I’m already there. Grounded. Present. A professionally accomplished IT guy who’s lived and worked across the UK, the US, and Europe, and learned that real connection doesn’t rush or demand. I travel for work Monday to Friday and stay near T1 and T2—places designed for professionals, where privacy is normal and respected.

We start with conversation. Easy, unforced. Coffee between us, maybe later dinner if time allows. We talk about travel, work, the small parts of ourselves that don’t always get airtime. There’s no need to invent a story. No pressure to perform. Just two adults choosing to be present.At some point, the tone softens. It’s not abrupt. It never is. It’s in the pause between sentences, the way eye contact lingers a second longer than usual. If you’re comfortable, we move to a more private setting—still discreet, still safe. Nothing hurried. Nothing that would ever leave you with regret.

There may be closeness. Gentle, consensual, and unambiguous. A slow kiss, unclaimed and unrecorded. Hands that explore only as far as you allow—meant to soothe, to awaken sensation, not to take anything away from you. A sensual rub that’s about relaxation and awareness, not obligation. You remain fully in control, fully yourself.There is no crossing into anything that changes you forever. No loss of v card, No risk of emotional baggage, No risk of catching diseases.No consequences waiting outside the door. The place i stay is so professional even to spend the night watching netflix and conversations.

What happens exists in that moment alone—contained, respectful, and private. We don’t exchange numbers or identities that follow you home. If privacy or discretion matters, lets use apps that protect discretion. This meeting doesn’t demand a sequel, and it doesn’t steal from your life.When we part, it’s easy. You return to your routine—office, commute, responsibilities—unchanged in who you are, maybe just carrying a quiet warmth with you. I return to my work, my travel, knowing that some connections are meaningful precisely because they don’t complicate things.

This isn’t about guilt or escape. IIt’s about choice.

A pause in a busy week, A conversation, 

A touch that asked for permission and gave nothing but presence. A moment that fits neatly between meetings, flights, and everyday life—and leaves you exactly where you began, just a little more aware of yourself.

I’m currently exploring an **offline AI budgeting app**

where:

\* Everything stays on the device

\* No bank sync, no cloud, no signup

\* You can add expenses naturally (like typing “Coffee $15”)

\* There’s a small, clean dashboard instead of complex charts

But before going any further, I genuinely want to ask this community:

**If you could design your ideal budgeting app, what features would you really want?**

Especially things you feel current apps get wrong or overcomplicate.

**Editor's note: CP in this post stands for Chronic Pain, not to be confused with cerebral palsy and child porn**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/N5QIYYbn9W): **January 14, 2026**

This is weird so I need to know if I'm crazy for going as far as I did.

I have a condition of chronic pain. The way I explain it to people without chronic pain is that if pain were on levels from 1 to 10, normal people are at most at a 2 or 3 from day to day where people with CP are at more like a 6. Like imagine stepping on a Lego or hitting your funny bone, that's a very brief but excruciating 8. It's like if you pulled a muscle and so there's pain and discomfort if you move it, but pretty much daily. Some days I am higher on the scale, rare blessed days I'm more a 4 or by some miracle lower.

Overall I am active and operate well. I do own canes, but I only use them on days when I'm 7 or above. Such a day came this past Sunday.

On top of my full time job, I have a part time. Due to being physically and legally disabled, I had all the paperwork already filed with my job in case I ever need accommodations. I have a handicap marker on my license plate and the placard on my rear view mirror and the works.

I was recently moved to a location closer to my home. I love my new team. My boss Amy is really great. My colleague Casey and I get along okay but were the same position as assistant coordinators to Amy. The reason I was moved to that location was that it expanded and they needed more hands so they added me.

Casey has wanted a promotion for a long time and everyone knows it. I was pretty open that I don't. Lol any promotion from my position would be a full-time and...I already have a full-time job. I do *this* job to pad my savings and because I frankly like the job. Being busy also helps with my anxiety.

I mean Casey works hard but she also likes to talk over me or rush to take charge of something before I can when I clearly was getting to it. She then announces it. ""Oh I handled that for you, OP. Don't worry!"" And at first I was annoyed but over time I was like alright then, but you didn't have to. I talked to Amy about this. I want to pull my weight but it can be challenging and redundant when Casey is racing to beat me to it. The point was for us to split tasks evenly. Amy said she would talk to her and I don't know what came of that but things didn't really change much so I just accepted it.

So when I came in Monday with my cane, everyone had questions. I emailed Amy Sunday night so she knew but I tend to be private so what I told everyone else was that I have a condition and sometimes I need a cane but not always.

Amy accommodated me. She assigned me tasks that required little to no movement. I was very grateful and got everything done pretty early so I called over the radio if there was anything else I could do. Casey said no she's got it so I just handled admin stuff that's usually on the backburner. Literally replied with ""okay I'll tackle the admin list then"" and Casey said no she's got it but Amy followed that with a thank you to me and confirmation that this would be helpful.

I still needed my cane yesterday (Tuesday) and it was similar. I completed most of the admin to-dos and Amy was so relieved to have it done. She thanked me for coming in and doing all that instead of calling out. Casey made a comment that she could've helped but I said that's okay and thanked her for handling the more physical tasks.

We ended up walking to the parking lot together and she asked which car was mine so I pointed at it. Then she said ""so I know you're not disabled, by the way."" And I asked what she meant. She just repeated herself and said ""so no cane tomorrow, okay? I won't tell. Just no cane tomorrow.""

👀.

I stood there like *what the fuck*? But I was meeting my best friend and just left to make it on time. I met my BFF Joy at the bar and we had a wonderful time. I brought my cane but tbh I didn't always use it. For example, I didn't use it to walk from my table to the bar to request another drink or when I got up to hug Joy goodbye.

Today, when I woke up, my pain was higher than my normal so I took my cane along. I texted Amy that I have my cane but doing okay in small bursts so put me in Coach lol I was having a good time at my main job and didn't give Casey a thought.

I arrive at my part time job and Casey saw my cane and went red. I mean like the way I looked when the Eagles lost to the 49ers lol just SUPER MAD. I greeted everyone and she ignored me completely. We got our assignments and she snidely said to me ""Well can you handle that with your cane and all?"" In a tone that even made Amy turn to look at her like WTF. I said I can manage and thanked her for her concern and we went about our work. Once again she raced to beat me to things and saying over the radio ""don't strain yourself, OP, I did x-task or got y-done""

I was so confused until about an hour ago when we finished work she again walked with me to the parking lot but this time showed me a video. It was me. It was me at the bar last night with Joy. I was just like...um why do you have a video of me - that's weird. She says it's proof. I asked of what? And she said it's proof I'm not disabled as I acted so ""wounded all day at work"" but suddenly don't need my cane at a bar.

What???? I wanted to explain that that's just not how CP works. Like yes I can stand up to hug my friend or get up and walk 3 strides to order a new drink but I can't, for example, lean over and organize a bottom drawer without a chair to sit in. I wanted to explain the CP is just an umbrella and under it are a myriad of experiences and abilities and that honestly, if she had left my tasks alone, I'd have done them. She didn't give me the chance and said ""no cane tomorrow. I'm serious. Or I'm going to Chad"" (Chad is Amy's boss).

I said ""About what?"" But she was already walking away from me and just got in her car.

It's just weird. And oddly Chad would know this is bs because his boyfriend has CP too. I'm not so much worried about being ""found out"" or anything but it's just weird and I'm literally typing an email to Amy CCing Chad about this weird behavior because it's just odd. Am I crazy to want to preemptively explain this? I am anxious ans paranoid in general so I don't want to overreact or make things worse.

Edit: I sent the email and also thanks for letting me know I'm not crazy for feeling weirded out.

Also I will be simply blocking anyone who is saying this is fake. I don't have time for your bs to be frank.

I also texted Amy and Chad.

Edit 2: JESUS CHRYSLER DRIVING CHRIST that's a lot of notifications...

I'll edit to try to reply all here because there isn't enough coffee in the world...

It's morning and I'm still about at a 7 and it's cold today so even if I didn't want to bring my cane, I would have to. I texted ahead so Amy can start thinking about tasks today.

For some common themes I've noticed, yeah my pain scale Lego idea wasn't on scale. Stepping on a Lego was the funniest thing I could think of that hurts so I wanted to paint a picture. I wasn't making a clinical pain chart lol feel free to use your own theatre of the mind scenarios to help people without chronic pain have an idea of what it's like.

Also I don't understand the vague ""don't use the term CP"" comments sorry. In this post it means chronic pain. It's within that context 🤷‍♀️ sorry but I just don't get the issue here or of its upsetting...? Idk

Amy and Chad have both responded so we will see how today goes. Anyway this was my first break in my FT job so I have to get back to it.

**Relevant / Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Time for a chat with your supervisor and / or HR. Make sure you bring the receipts.

> **OOP:** The problem is that I don't have any other than what others have seen about her taking over my tasks. We were alone both times she confronted me in the parking lot and she showed me the video on her phone.

**Commenter 2:** This is actually insane behavior because what? Did we not learn about invisible disabilities? Or people who only need a wheelchair/cane sometimes and are ambitory users? This is actually insane work, who says that to someone? Especially when you’ve got the documentation to prove it. NOR OP. I hope you make a fool out of them because this is actually insane. I don’t know much about legal stuff but this seems like enough to take to HR if you have one. Seriously what is Casey on?

> **OOP:** Thank you I was really worried that my past trauma was causing me to blow this out of proportion so I was on the fence about it like maybe I'm just out of touch here.

**Commenter 3:** What the fuck!? NoR - you're *underreacting*

Info: how old are you both?? And what's the job?

> **OOP:** I'm 34 and she's 29.
> 
> The job is real specific but it has to do with the public school system. We have a lot to do with kids who struggle with specific subjects and help them in a way a tutor would but more fun if that makes sense.

**Commenter 4:** NOR - if anything you're underreacting to your coworker creating a hostile work environment. Does your workplace have an HR department?

> **OOP:** Not really HR issues are run through Chad's boss who is also basically the 2nd in command of the entire org

**Commenter 5:** She followed you to a bar to film you like a stalker. Let that sink in.

You need to go to Amy and Chad not to preemptively explain your situation but bc a coworker is so obsessed with your personal medical details she is stalking you, threatening to jeopardize your job and demanding you don’t use a mobility aid that you have proper documentation for (I.e. legal handicap placard). NOR.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/2FX46xyezf): **January 15, 2026 (next day)**

**AIO? My coworker took video of me outside of work to ""prove"" I'm not disabled - Update (Thursday)**

I was asked a lot to [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/vxAhYkRJHQ) when I got off work so here it is. 😬 Today was… weirdly quiet, which almost made it worse. Not sure what everyone knows but they at least know somethings up.

I wasn’t even in the same area as Casey during check-in and I have no clue when she actually arrived. I usually see her as our shifts are the same hours. Turns out she’d been assigned to the back office doing other tasks (hours reduced), while I was put at the admin booth at the entrance handling paperwork and spreadsheets (they definitely took advantage of because I’m good at it 🤣). So we didn’t cross paths at all at first.

I actually turned on a voice recorder app as soon as I got to work, just in case. I also added a shortcut on my phone so I can start recording quickly if I need to just in case. I didn’t wanna be caught off-guard like before. I did feel a little silly doing it, but I’d rather feel silly than unprepared, you know?

I didn’t see Casey until near the end of the shift, and even then it was barely a glimpse. She looked up, saw me, and immediately turned away. Like full on avoidance. It made my stomach drop. I just turned away and minded my business. Amy was very reassuring but also vague at first. I didn't like that and I think my face said so and she said she doesn't like all the red tape and such either but to be patient because they need to go through all the right channels and steps.

Amy let me go home early, but she told me to log my full hours anyway and made it clear she and Chad are actively talking about this and taking it seriously and I am almost certain she and he had been texting the whole shift. She also walked me to my car and said that will continue for now until everything is resolved.

About an hour after my shift ended, I got an email from her (Chad CC'd) saying that tomorrow (Friday), Casey will be assigned to admin duty in the back office unless something changes before the shift, and that we should not be interacting at all. It's a long weekend so I figure all the behind the scenes stuff will be happening then.

I also found out that Casey already “presented her evidence” That includes the video she showed me before and another video from yesterday (Wednesday). Apparently she filmed me at a local winery during Wine Wednesday (there’s a clip of me getting up to grab a bottle a few steps away, and later another clip of me standing up and doing a small little celebratory dance after a tabletop game win).

That’s the part that really messed with my head because hold on when did she start recording me? For how long?

I mean I could maybe believe coincidence once, like, okay lightning struck and its weird. Same town, same general area, blah blah blah. But twice, 2 different days??? Two different places?? That’s when it stopped feeling like my paranoia getting the best of me and started feeling… unsettling. I’m honestly starting to wonder if this is something that might need police involvement, as some comments suggested, and I hate that my brain even went there but I mean what other options are there right now??

I’m typing this from a bar right now, but not the same one as before thank god. It is still local to the school (teachers come here a lot) and it’s Thirsty Thursday, so there’s a bigger happy hour discount if you show your school ID. Joy is with me, and a couple other friends are on their way. Joy had been here during my shift in case I needed any backup fast.

That said, my head is absolutely on a swivel. So is Joy’s. I don’t feel relaxed the way I normally would. I keep scanning the room without meaning to and when people get too close to me or stand in any way facing me I look up to see if it's her. It's fucking weird.

I’m still trying to process all of this, and honestly I’m confused more than anything...I keep going back and forth between “maybe this is nothing” and “this doesn’t feel normal”

Right now I’m just documenting everything and doing what HR tells me to do, but I don’t like how small and watched this situation is starting to feel and I hate that I'm recording every moment I can in case she pops up.

If nothing else, I’m safe tonight and will be staying at Joy's...I’m not alone and work has made sure we’re separated for now. I guess we’ll see what tomorrow brings. So unless something crazy happens o won't be updating until this is resolved.

Wish me luck 🙏.

**Edit:** I just replied to a follow-up email answering some recurring questions HR asked... 

My answers al ended up centered around:

I have never directly or indirectly invited Casey out anywhere. We are not friends outside of work and have never socialized one-on-one.

I was also asked whether I feel safe at work. Right now, yes, because management has taken steps to separate us and has been present and supportive. I've yet to be alone at all at work. I’m continuing to follow their guidance and document everything as instructed.

I’ll update if anything materially changes, but for now I’m letting HR handle it outside making a non-emergency police report in the morning.

**Top Comment**

**Commenter:** She sounds more unhinged than originally thought based on the fact she’s filmed you multiple times. And refusing to understand that disabilities are on a spectrum. Especially with chronic pain. It doesn’t mean you’re incapacitated all the time or all tasks are equally difficult.

Keep us updated on what comes down the line as far as disciplinary actions by HR for her!

#----NEW UPDATE----

**Trigger Warnings:** >!racism!<

[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/A2PSfBpMTk): **January 23, 2026 (eight days later from the previous update)**

Hey on my phone so sorry for typos

Happy Friday guys. Thanks so much for all the sweet messages checking on me. All things considered I'm okay. My pain spiked pretty badly this past Tuesday, so I took it easy and took off from my fulltime job to pamper myself. That gave me time to think and spend time gaming and gardening. That was a welcome break to brace myself for my part time job. So yes I have been taking care of myself and I loved all the reddit moms (and dads) checking in.

This will be long as I am trying nit forget anything so I can close this out (or at least put a pin in it) as I know for me as a reddit scroller, unfinished stories are almost as frustrating as the ones that go on forever. I’m hoping this is my final update on the matter.

Legal is now involved. I genuinely didn’t even know our organization even had a legal department but apparently it does and they’re looped in alongside HR. An HR rep has been communicating with me but honestly things have been very quiet on that front, which I’m taking as no news is good news.

I’m still at my school and I still love it. I love the students and faculty and even the parents (anyone in education knows parents can be great or they can be soooooo not great lol and rarely is there in between). Casey has been transferred to an admin position at an office in the company I don’t even go to. I haven’t seen her since my last post and I'm glad of it.

Work has been peaceful without her. I have more work to do now as the only assistant coordinator there but I'm starting to get my rhythm and the staff there has been very supportive plus I have more chances to get to know the people I work with.

What I didn’t expect was finding out (from multiple coworkers in several conversations) was that almost from the moment I joined that campus, Casey had been trying to spread rumors about me. Including suggesting that I’m a danger to kids or that I have an “explosive temper” which is honestly wild to hear about myself. I’m almost always described by others as soft-spoken to a fault and usually get told I need to be more strict with students. If anything I balance Amy out as the “good cop” to her “bad cop” plus the angry black woman tropes are sooooo freaking tired, so it was extra annoying to find out that she was trying paint me as such. She also said to people that the reason she took over my tasks was because I did them wrong or Madd her job harder and she had to redo things. She basically had a narrative that I was Mr. Magoo causing chaos and she was the saintly hard working teammate trying to clean up my messes so I don't get in trouble.

HR is still investigating, and I’ve been told to continue documenting anything that comes up. I’m ready to do so but so far it’s been quiet.

One unexpected upside is I’m now the sole person at my campus with my title, which came with a pay raise. Not how I would’ve chosen to get it but I’ll take the win.

I did file a police report - I think I mentioned this in my last post but if not I was told very clearly that filming in public places isn’t illegal and that there’s no reasonable expectation of privacy in those spaces, so there was no criminal action taken (cue my eyeroll but at least its officially reported). The report is strictly documentation. The local places I frequent have been made aware of the situation and that a report exists.

My friends were incredible, they helped me get my car cleaned and detailed just to be absolutely sure there wasn’t anything like a tracker or Airtag like some comments suggested we do. I also finally got around to asking my neighbor to help me install my other security cams. I used to have only one and my doorbell cam and now I can pull up live footage on the whole system all around my house. And to those suggesting a dash cam, I already have one turns out. I never used that feature, so my friends helped. My car is fairly new and I’m still getting used to it.

I did start to go over and backup all footage going back since I started at my campus by motion activation points and now have a hilarious compilation of the neighborhood cats being adorable or the crows I feed leaving random things lol (yes I did the crow mom thing). So another good thing came of this.

I’m not changing my routines... but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t still a little on edge. Especially since multiple coworkers mentioned hearing Casey blow up at Amy on her last day on campus and Amy sent her home for the day (this was on my day off as only Amy and Casey worked MLK day and the coworkers there volunteered to work the holiday for extra pay - time and a half). What she said varies depending on who tells it, but the fact that it happened at all doesn’t exactly make me feel warm and fuzzy as I'm sure you'll understand. But I tell myself everything that can be done on my end, has been done. So I try not to stress about it.

That said, I also reached out to a few lawyers just to understand my options. I’m very aware that HR exists to protect the company not me so I want to cover my bases. I meet one over Zoom at my lunch break so wish me luck.

I still record when I walk to or from my car. My therapist reminded me to be careful to make sure my being proactive doesn’t turn into living in fear and giving in to my anxiety or PTSD (past trauma). I’m taking that seriously as my mental health has been a journey and I don't want to go back to the way I was before. I can’t and won’t let someone else shrink my life again.

I do want to address recurring comments because I can’t reply to everyone individually..

""She goes to bars a lot - drinking is bad!""

Yes, I go to bars. No, that does not mean I drink heavily or have a drinking problem (what a leap!). I mean, look I’m disabled and I socialize within what my body allows and thats an isolating enough experience if I let it be. My friends (mostly able-bodied people) go to bars, so sometimes that’s where I go...

Sometimes I drink, sometimes I don’t...sometimes it’s a mocktail, sometimes it’s soda. I know my body better than strangers on the internet, to be blunt. For what it’s worth, my ex was an alcoholic and he was abusive and spiraled until it ended him so I promise I’m very aware of what that looks like and am probably one of the last people to be overly concerned about on that matter.

""How does she have time to work 2 Jobs and go out? Why wont she just go home""

I do in fact have time to go out after work. I work from home full-time and part-time with the school. If I go straight home after a long day I tend to just… keep working. I’m a workaholic by nature and going out helps me actually relax and not make my entire life about my job. I also intentionally line up PTO with most school holidays to rest and take staycations. This is me managing my health both physical and mental not avoiding reality.

""Don't go anywhere alone, OP""/concerns for my safety

Right now I’m both safe and supported. I’m cautious but I’m still living my life. q I’m choosing not to let this take over my entire world and this is supported by my therapist.

Thank you to the people who offered thoughtful advice and genuine concern ❤️ And to the folks who were weirdly judgmental....well, you must be an absolute blast at parties.

I’m hoping this is my final Update

Edit: the Ice storm woke me up and looked at my phone - Joy and my other friends have a group chat and I think they forgot which chat I’m on with them because they've been trading screenshots of Casey's social media. From what they gathered, Casey did put some of her socials on private in the past day or so but that didn't stop my friends from screenshotting some disturbing posts. In short, Casey has bought into the stereotype that black women especially ""steal from the government"" by leaning on welfare (such an age old and tired racist trope yet again) and other government programs and this included ""faking"" disabilities to ""rip off"" public programs because we clearly don't want to work /s

I did just forward this all on to the HR rep I am in contact with. Turns outs, this probably wasn't about my cane after all. Just plain flavored, canned racism without salt. Frankly how boring is that in my country 😴.

Edit 2: Joy I'd over with homemade Chili and news. No idea what to make of it but Casey is related to a higher up. Looks like a uncle/Neice. That could be another reason legal is involved but we're guessing at this point.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** The cat and crow compilation is a lovely side effect of something so taxing.

PS: If I understand, has your colleague been transferred? Or had her shifts adjusted?

> **OOP:** She works in one of the company offices now, from what I understand on an ""admin break"" - it's a reduced hour pause, I'm told and far away from me

**Commenter 2:** Sounds like you're on top of this, and hopefully you will live your life in peace after all the drama. It also seems like you have a healthy vigilance and not paranoia.

Good luck honey!!!!! You deserve a great life.

> **OOP:** Thanks so much! I'm hoping the same honestly. My fulltime job is aware due to the harassment/stalking and my boss this morning when I logged in checked in with me about it and said GOD I hope the rest is just so boring you'll struggle to even remember telling me anything new about it and I was like SAME

**Commenter 3:** So, Casey crafted a narrative without even knowing anything about you? What a whackadoodle. If she knew you’re Black and nothing else when she started these rumors, consider sending that little tidbit to HR and asking them to add race discrimination to your complaint.

> **OOP:** I didn't even think about it but dammit I might mention to Amy when I come in today
> 
>> **Commenter 4:** I've been following your posts about this situation from the start OP, and as a Black woman myself, when I saw you mention that detail in this update - the first time I saw it brought up throughout this saga - my first thought was, ""Ah, there it is!""
>> 
>> You don't mention Casey's race, but I'd bet anything she is not Black, she holds some unpleasant ideas about Black people, and ""proving"" that you're faking your disability was just a convenient excuse to get the office against you once & for all. I'm glad she's being dealt with seriously by your workplace - she sounds genuinely dangerous as a colleague.
>> 
>>> **OOP:** Yeah I didn't think about it that way at first so my flabbers are a bit gasted lol my job has a zero tolerance policy for racism especially in the recent political climate. Huge no no. Of my team actually, I am one of 2 people of color. Amy is Korean American. Everyone else is white, including Casey. Looking back...I feel like there were signs unfortunately

Backround: my parent's are family friends with my roommate's parents. I was never really friends with my roommate in high school, but got to know her from living with her in a dorm. Recently, MY PARENTS got ME an apartment and pay  RENT every month. So pretty much, roommate's parent's don't pay 

Over the past few months when we come home from class,  we have walked in on
1. Her mom doing our laundry almost every week. 
2. Her mom cooking food and cleaning for us 
3. HER MOM CLEANING MY FUCKING CLOSET and calling me a slut for having tube tops and mini skirts, etc
5. Her Mom and dad chillin at the apartment Friday nights to make sure we don't party. 

I just can't deal anymore. I told my roommate to tell them to stop, but she said I'm overreacting. Am I overreacting? Should I tell my parents?

I have lost my mind. Literally. Udhdudbdu helpppp.

TLDR: MY roommate's mom keeps coming into my apartment

>Omg fucking helicopter psychos. Tell her to have this stop immediately. This is a gross invasion of your space. Your home is supposed to be your sanctuary. If they continue, get the locks changed ASAP.

**OOP**

>>I can't, the building management doesn't allow lock changes. And everyone is allowed to have a spare, so they can't help 😭😭.

>> She doesn't seem to think it's a big deal either.

**radicalpastafarian**

>>>Well it *isn't* a big deal to her. They are her parents. The three of them are entitled to treat each other whatever way they like. But they are not *your* parents. They are not entitled to treat you as they do her.

**Darkwings13**

>Why did you let them freeload and invade your privacy? Tell your parents and give your roomate notice to get out by the end of the month.

**OOP**

>>When I was supposed to move out, her parent's didn't want her to have a ""new roommate"" on campus. I had no problem with her up till we moved out of campus housing, so I didn't mind her moving in with me. My parent's didn't mind it at all either.


**Editors Note: OOP removed edit 1 for space - I've added it back**

Edit: I have tried asking them for their set of spare keys back a month after we moved in, and it ended in them yelling at me about how disrespectful I am to ""older people."" I also tried to go through her mom's purse a few weeks ago,(which I probably shouldn't have done) and got caught by my roommate. She was really upset about it (which I totally understand) and haven't tried getting it back since.

Mini update: I took out edit 1 to shorten the post. I told my older brother about what happened, emailed my building manager, and was able to get a response from him saying I can put a lock on my bedroom door. Me and my brother went to home depot and got a basic lock. Her mom is currently cooking in the kitchen and watching my brother fix the lock. She doesn't look too happy. I'll update you all again when I tell my parents.

Edit: sorry for all the edits but I think I need to clarify something. The reason my roommate isn't paying rent is cause her parents hit a tough spot financially last winter, and my dad wanted to ease the burden on them a little. He said he would help out by giving my roommate a place to stay so her parents could just worry about her tuition and not room/board.

Edit 2: Imma tell my parents about it. I just didn't want to ruin their friendship as they were close friends for a lonnggggg time.

[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/wk1XMskOuk)  **May 6, 2019 (Next Day)**

RM= roommate's mom   R=Roommate

I came back from my morning run around 7 am this morning, and RM and R were in the kitchen making some coffee. She has never been there this early before. 

I decided to talk to them about everything prior to going to class. I atarted off with ""hey auntie, can we talk?"" (In brown culture everyone is called an aunt) and these are some points I listed:

1. I appreciate that she has been cooking and cleaning, but I want to do that on my own. I love to cook and felt that I was never allowed in my own kitchen. I also told her that I want to do my own laundry and clean my room myself. 

2. I don't want her in my room. I reminded her that I talked to her about this when it first happened, and that's why I put the lock on the door.

3. I told her that if she wants to be with R, to let R text me and lmk that RM would be in the apartment. 

They expressed understanding and I hugged it out with RM. 

Before going to class, I put a load of laundry. My friend is having a birthday dinner today, and I decided to wear this cute white dress with an open back (my mom even got me this dress since she thought it was so cute) and tossed it in the washer so it could be fresh for tonight. I asked RM multiple times if she was planning on doing laundry today, and she said no. I told her that I would be back around 1, and she can do laundry when I finish mine later this afternoon if needed (I didn't want her touching my clothes). She was okay with it and said R didn't have laundry today. Cool. I left feeling really relieved, but I still locked my bedroom door. 

I got back to my apartment about half hour ago, and I couldn't find my white dress. As soon as I came home, R looked nervous. My clothes were in the dryer, and I didn't do that for a fact. RM states that I put them in the dryer and just forgot. Ughhh. I locked myself in my room, and I know she probably took the dress as it was something she wouldn't approve of.

When I was in my room, I heard RM talking to R in our language, she told her daughter something along the lines of ""idk why she's freaking out about that dress. In India, escorts and prostitutes wear those kinds of clothing."" And she went on to tell R that I won't find a husband wearing stuff like this.

I honestly think she wanted me to hear all that.  is she is seriously just being a passive aggressive bitch to me rn? I'm trying so hard not to break down and cry. 

I'm heading over to my parents right now and I'm telling them everything when they come back home tonight. I'll keep you posted.


[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/gdhAeExjBw)  **May 8, 2019 (2 days later)**

Okay guys, I'm sorry for updating you guys late and for the super long post, but I want to make sure I get important details in there.  

**Editors Note the following 3 paragraphs were edited out of the post but visible on rareddit (added them back in)**

When I left my apartment yesterday to go to my parents house, I forgot to take my credit card. I walked back up to my apartment, and R was studying while RM was watching TV. RM asked me where I was going, and I told her ""away from you."" I guess that pissed her off, cause she got up and started yelling about how bad of a parent my mom is by teaching me how to ""go around the city with different guys"" and ""talk back to adults."" I was so frustrated, I ended up cussing her out.

This got her really really mad, and she ran to the kitchen and grabbed a wooden spoon from one of the drawers.

This crazy bitch was gonna hit me with a wooden spoon. I ran out of my apartment as fast as I could to my car, and I honestly could not stop laughing. This was insane.


I THINK RM IS CRAZY and needs a MH checkup. Seriously. I am very worried for her wellbeing. 

My mom was home, along with my brother, my brother's girlfriend, and her parents. I told them everything that happened, and no one liked what they heard. My mom called my dad to tell him what happened.

When my dad came home, he hugged me immediately and started crying. Me being called a prostitute and a slut was too much for him to handle. I've never seen dad cry before, and it hurt me so so bad. 
My mom called RM and RD and R to come over to talk. They came over immediately (they probably knew something was up from the tone of my mom's voice, she was so close to growling). 

Mom was being petty though, when they came home, she didn't allow them inside. She made them stand on the doorstep the whole time, and I could tell this was pissing RM off. Some points of the confrontation:

1. Why are you calling my daughter these names?
RM: I didn't say anything. She's making        up lies. 

2. Why are you even in the apartment that much? You told us that you go there once a month to check on R. You also said she visits you every weekend?
RM: The kids don't know how to cook, so I help. Also kids are busy studying so they need it. 

3. Why is a 50 year old man in my daughter's apartment?
-no answer-

4. Why are you going through my daughter's stuff? Why does she need a lock? Why are YOU limiting my daughter's times with her friends? 
-no answer-

*I shall also mention that Roommate's dad was SITTING IN THEIR CAR ON THE DRIVEWAY DURING THIS WHOLE CONFRONTATION*

But things got heated up really quickly. RM started insulting my parents:

- She said my mom is a bad mom because she never disciplined her children.

- she said I am unruly and that the clothes I wear are despicable (she brought up clothes a shit ton, like this lady is really offended by my fashion sense). This annoyed my brother, and he showed RM IG pictures of R wearing more revealing clothing than me, and sitting on boys laps. RM shut her mouth about my clothes immediately. 

- She then proceeded to try to insult my parent's professions by saying they have ""God Complexes"". This pissed my brother off to the brink, and he replied with "" you own 3 subways and are almost broke, but we never say anything about it."" This pushed RM OFF THE EDGE, and she leaned in closer to my brother and attempted TO SLAP HIM. 

This lady tried to SLAP my 24 y/o brother IN FRONT OF MY PARENTS. 

They argued more, and my mom asked where the dress was again. This time, she walked away to their car, and pulled my dress out of her purse. She came back to where we were standing AND LITERALLY THREW THE DRESS IN MY FACE.

My mom had no more patience left, and back Slapped RM across her face. I've never seen my mom raise her hand on anyone, and I burst out laughing. Even my dad had to walk back inside to keep himself from laughing in front of RM. RM started crying and said she was going to call the cops on us. 

When they left we had a big discussion:

My parents were angry that I never told them about this before. They said that they got me that apartment so I could do what I wanted. They wanted me to be able to have friends over, have a place to chill, and have a place without parental influence. 


However, they are very proud and happy with the way I dealt with the situation, and said calling the cops would unnecessarily escalate the situation that could be solved by talking. Thank you all for the advice. I appreciate it alot. ❤.

They were mad at my brother cause they said he shouldn't have shown those pictures of R cause now she has to deal with that trouble at home. 

My parents agreed that letting R live in my apartment without consulting me first was wrong on their part. My parent's started the eviction process today. 

Anyways, it may be hard to believe, but I do stand up for myself a lot. It's just that in this situation, I didn't want to do anything that would offend my parents because I had respect for their friendship and I didn't want to ruin it or do something that would embarrass my parents. I learned from this, and I have growing up to do, but now that I know I have support, I won't worry about petty shit like this later. 

I also don't want to live alone so one of my best friends from high school is gonna be my new roommate(no, she isn't Indian). No one is living rent free in this situation. 

I would also like to say that even though I wasn't friends with R in high school, living with her for 2 years did help me make a bond with her. Idk if we can be friends after this, but it feels bad losing a friend. 

Also my parents are liberal ass Indians. They have lived here in America for over 40 years. They didn't want to spy on me at all. They don't mind me wearing skirts or tube tops or having guy friends over. 

TLDR: My family helped and we're getting her evicted.

Edit 1: I forgot to add, for those of you guys who think that my parents paying my rent and tuition doesn't make me an adult, I don't think it does. I'm so blessed to have parents who want to make sure that their kids graduate without debt. Also, it's my parent's money. They'll do what they want. This gives me no excuse to have a GPA less than a 4.0, Js. 

Edit 2: I took out the part where RM tried to threaten me with a wooden spoon to shorten the post.  It was funny though. 

Edit 3: I added a TLDR. 

I included most of the important points. If something doesn't make sense I'll reply in the comments. 

The cops are yet to show up. 

Edit 4: GUYS WE FORGOT TO ASK FOR THE KEY BACK. FUCKING DAMN ITTTT
- nevermind, roommate's dad dropped them off at my parent's this morning. False alarm.

I’m sharing this because I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about what makes a coworker gift actually useful versus just another piece of desk clutter.,"We’ve all been there—the office secret Santa or the ""thank you"" gift for a teammate that ends up being another generic coffee mug, a candle they can't light at their desk, or a succulent that dies in three weeks because the office has no windows.

If you’re looking for something that actually helps with the 3 PM corporate burnout, I want to make a case for the **Mini Zen Garden.**

Here’s why it’s become my go-to recommendation for professional gifting:

**1. It’s a ""Tactile Reset""** Most office work is digital and abstract. A Zen garden provides a rare sensory experience. Taking 2 minutes to rake sand or move a stone is a ""pattern interrupt"" for the brain. It’s a physical way to ground yourself during a stressful Zoom call or after a rough email.

**2. It’s ""Professional"" but Personal** It’s hard to find gifts that feel thoughtful without being ""too much"" for a workplace setting. A Zen garden looks like high-end decor, but the intent—wishing someone peace and focus—is what makes it a great anti-burnout tool.

**3. It’s Low Maintenance** Unlike office plants, you can’t kill a Zen garden. It can sit on a desk for a month of vacation and look exactly the same when they get back.

**4. It’s Interactive** Most desk decor just sits there. A Zen garden is meant to be touched. I’ve found that coworkers who are ""fidgeters"" or who deal with high-anxiety roles (like PMs or devs) tend to use them the most.

https://reddit.com/link/1qqw2d9/video/fli771714fgg1/player

**What to look for in a good one:** If you're DIY-ing or buying one, look for:

* **Deep trays:** So the sand doesn't spill everywhere.
* **Natural stones:** Avoid the plastic ones; the weight of a real river stone feels better.
* **Fine sand:** It holds the ""ripple"" patterns much better than coarse sand.

I’m curious—what’s the best ""non-boring"" gift you’ve ever received from a coworker or boss? Do you prefer functional gifts or things that are just for the ""vibe"" of your workspace?

**TL;DR:** Stop giving mugs. Give something tactile that helps with stress. Desk Zen gardens are the perfect ""professional"" gift that actually helps with mid-day burnout.",1,1769748905.0,GiftIdeas,1,1.0,False

First, I called K's gynecologist. She's very popular which is a good sign. But it also means she didn't have new patient appointment availability until February 16th. 

But that's okay, because I just happen to have the day off work Feb 16th for President's day. 

I set a pelvic floor therapy appointment with a different provider, later that same day. 

That way, in theory, I'll be able to become an established patient at the new gyn, get a pelvic floor therapy referral, and then start the pelvic floor therapy, all on my day off. 

So, I don't need to use up a PTO day for that. But still...I'm going to need to take a day off sooner than that.

Then, 15 minutes later, the other customer had left but I was still writing something on my laptop, and her colleague came over and said I'm sorry, we're closed now, so you have to go."" I said ""Right now?"" I thought that was unusual, since I've been there before and they usually let you stay a few minutes as long as you don't order any more food/drinks, since it takes them some time to clean up and close the store. But her response was ""Unfortunately, I'm closing right now."" It wasn't the girl I talked to earlier, but her tone felt formal and standoffish. I'm not sure, if it had anything to do with that exchange earlier, but either way, I just got up and left.

Was I in the wrong here? I mean, I remembered later that she did seem to be slouching a bit, like maybe she wanted to make herself smaller, but is it really such a big deal? Like I wouldn't say anything about weight, but height feels more of a neutral characteristic especially for women, and plenty of models are tall. So was she genuinely offended by that comment or am I overthinking it?",0,1769748416.0,NoStupidQuestions,1,0.5,False

Coffee is a bit of a special interest for me; real coffee produces a feeling of wellbeing, that instant coffee never has, for me. Instant coffee may a bit of a buzz/focus, but real coffee feels like a whole different ball game.

For me, real coffee is a life tonic; it's the best anti-depressant that I've ever come across and I've tried several of the medical variety in the past. For me, coffee provides all of the benefits of a medical antidepressant, but with none of the side effects that often accompany them.

It's not just the feeling of well-being and calm that real coffee offers me, that makes it irresistible, the antidepressant properties that it offers me are equally important. It helps keep my adhd somewhat in check. Without it, I'm an irritable/ruminating ball of tension. Dex helps, but even that has its negatives for me, that real coffee doesn't have.

I also love the ritual about the process of making that cuppa. From selecting the right variety of beans that I feel like drinking at that time, to getting the grind size optimal for said beans/brew method that I have on hand, to the different burr grinders that I own, which will produce a different taste of even the same bean.

For example, a wall grinder and a manual box grinder, both burr grinders, will result in a different tasting cup, even if the grind size is as identically sized as possible. Like they have their own personalities.

I also love the different styles of coffee making; stovetop, French press and cold brew are my current favourites, but one day finances permitting, I'll get a coffee machine.",2,1769748333.0,AutisticWithADHD,0,1.0,False

As I inhale bright smoke from the fire I’ve created.

Navigating the busy coffee shop,

I pick a table far away from any family,

To shield them from my sin of disposition.

I was really interested in receiving a cup reading I wanted a general 12 month cup since it was the new year. When she drew the cup there were obstacles and she reccomeded cleansing . Even though she has already tried the first time she bought more coffee and proceeded to draw not one but three more cups. This was due to some difficulties and so much information coming through in the cups she wanted to be thorough.  In hindsight I should have ordered a relationship cup as that was the heaviest energy that came through. Everything she read through was exactly what I’m experiencing right now in my situation.  The accuracy was impressive . She described the exact energy and situation I was in l without me giving  her any  information.

What she said would occur happened shortly after and she also gave great advice. She said that a third party would continue to interfere and they definitely did ..

She also predicted someone to be very upset about my relationship and they infact were and told me in person they were. She also was able to pinpoint this persons gender and social position in relation to me.

What set Canopy apart is her true care and love for her craft. She goes above and beyond always . You can tell she’s putting all her effort into this and not just passing along half effort. She respects the work and the person she’s reading for. She also communicates well if you ever have any concerns!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I didn’t know wether to post this on here or not but I felt like I needed other’s opinions about this and see other’s perspectives. I don’t post or talk much about my relationship on social media but I’ve been with my bf for about 6 years, this year will be 7 years in August. I could say things are great between him and I, we talk about everything we have in mind no matter how sensitive a topic is, communication is key right. Anyways, years back we’ve managed to hold decent job whether it was part time or full time. I chose to do part time jobs to focus on college, it took me a while to get a college degree and a certification in a healthcare field. I was on and off about choosing which major was the right fit for me but I never gave up and now I can say all my hard work paid off. Last year, I landed a good full time job with decent pay into my career. It’s not much money just yet but patience is key and I know better things will come along the way within time and I’m all for that. Now, my bf being a year older than me does not want to go to college or at least try invest his time into a career. I’ve had multiple talks about this with him and he’s always negative about it and it’s becoming draining. When I was working part time I didn’t have a lot of money and he didn’t mind paying for things and I appreciated that so much from him. Now since I have my “big girl job” I’ve been paying for our dinners, coffees, sweet treats, etc. 

I could say he has a decently paying job. I don’t want to brag about this nor think of myself highly or anything but I am now making more money than him. I don’t mind paying for stuff when we go out because he usually drives us around but I just wonder if he has any bother about that because he has seen the struggles I went through to get to where I am. I love him dearly to suggest and be positive about guiding him into wanting to grow as an individual. He mentioned that he has no idea what he wants to do in life and I asked him what interests him in something he’ll want to do for financial stability and he says he does not know. I had a long talk with him about this and he was basically leading to as if I was giving him an ultimatum which I was not. I’m just getting tired of him being negative about these types of things and it seems like he doesn’t really take my advice into consideration because he tends to get comfortable at any job that doesn’t lead to any career growth. He’s a smart guy and I really hope he decides or comes up with a plan for the future because I have a lot of plans in my future. I eventually want to move out of my parents house, travel and possibly plan for either adopting another dog along the way or maybe even children. I just want to end up being the money maker in my relationship. I want to grow and build a strong foundation. 

Now my question is, should I continue to wait to see if he really does want to get a career or a better paying job, possibly give him a push? Or think about an ultimatum? You would think after being with someone for this long they would have it figured out. Now I’m all for things will come within time, but I don’t want to be waiting too long on someone who isn’t willing to progress..

They’re always arranged neatly, like someone wanted me to notice...","My keys go missing almost every morning.

Not misplaced. Not forgotten in a jacket pocket or dropped behind the couch. Missing in a way that feels intentional. Like they were removed from the day before it started.

I keep them on a hook by the door. I’ve done that for years. It’s muscle memory now. Come home, lock the door, hang the keys. Wallet on the shelf. Shoes off. Same order, every time.

The first morning it happened, I assumed I was distracted.

I stood in the doorway, coffee cooling in my hand, staring at the empty hook like it might explain itself if I waited long enough. I checked my bag. My jacket. The counter. The bathroom sink. Nothing.

I was already late, so I did what I hate doing and left without them. Borrowed a spare from the junk drawer and told myself I’d sort it out later.

When I got home that night, my keys were back.

Not tossed on the counter. Not dropped near the door.

Hanging neatly on the hook.

Lined up. Key teeth all facing the same direction. The little flashlight attachment straightened so it didn’t twist the ring.

It looked deliberate.

I remember standing there longer than necessary, listening to the quiet of the apartment, waiting for the moment where something else happened.

Nothing did.

The next morning, they were gone again.

Same routine. Same empty hook. Same brief panic followed by annoyance at myself. I checked everywhere this time. I even emptied the trash.

Nothing.

That evening, I opened the door and felt it immediately.

They were back.

This time, they were laid out on the small table by the door instead of the hook. Not scattered. Arranged. The house key at the top. Car key beneath it. Everything aligned like a diagram.

Like someone wanted me to see the full set.

I didn’t touch them right away.

I stood there with the door still open behind me, listening for movement. For breathing. For anything that would justify how carefully they’d been placed.

The apartment was empty.

No windows open. No signs of anyone being inside. Nothing disturbed.

I locked the door, hung the keys back on the hook, and told myself I was overthinking it.

By the end of the week, it was happening every day.

Always gone in the morning. Always back by the time I returned. Sometimes on the hook. Sometimes on the table. Once, lined up along the edge of the counter like a reminder.

I started testing it.

One night, I left them on the kitchen counter instead of the hook.

In the morning, the counter was empty.

That evening, they were back on the hook.

I tried putting them in a drawer.

They were gone when I woke up.

When I came home, they were on the table again. This time with the drawer slightly open, like something had checked it.

I checked my locks obsessively. Nothing forced. Nothing scratched. No signs of entry.

I told myself it had to be me.

Sleepwalking. Stress. Some habit I’d forgotten I had.

That explanation worked until yesterday morning.

I woke up earlier than usual and sat in the living room, pretending to scroll on my phone while watching the door.

The keys were on the hook.

At 6:42 a.m., I heard a soft sound.

Metal on metal.

Not loud. Just enough.

The keys lifted.

Not fell. Not dropped.

Lifted.

They didn’t swing.

They didn’t clatter.

They were removed carefully, one by one, like whoever was doing it didn’t want to wake me.

I didn’t see anything move.

But when I checked the hook a minute later, it was empty.

Tonight, when I got home, the keys were waiting.

Laid out more precisely than ever before.

And for the first time, there was something new added to the arrangement.

A small slip of paper.

Folded once.

On it, written in neat, unfamiliar handwriting, were two words:

You noticed.

I didn’t throw the note away.

I don’t know why. Every sensible part of me said to rip it up, flush it, pretend it never existed. Instead, I unfolded it again and smoothed it flat on the table, like I was afraid of creasing it.

The paper was warm.

Not fresh-from-a-printer warm. More like it had been held for a while. Folded. Unfolded. Thought about.

I checked the apartment again. Slower this time. Methodical. Closet. Shower. Under the bed. Behind the curtains. Nothing out of place. Nothing that suggested someone had been careful enough to tidy up after themselves.

That night, I didn’t hang the keys on the hook.

I set them on the table and placed my phone beside them, camera facing outward. I didn’t tell myself I was setting a trap. I told myself I just wanted peace of mind.

I slept lightly. Every small sound pulled me back to the surface.

At 6:39 a.m., I woke up without an alarm.

The room felt occupied.

Not crowded. Not threatening. Just… aware.

I stayed still and watched the table from where I lay.

The keys didn’t move.

Then the phone screen went black.

Not dimmed. Off.

I hadn’t touched it.

A second later, I heard the sound again.

Metal, gently separated.

The keys slid—not lifted—across the table, slow and smooth, like they were being guided along an invisible line. They reached the edge and stopped, perfectly aligned.

I held my breath.

They rose.

Just enough to clear the surface.

No shaking. No rush.

They were carried out of my line of sight, toward the door.

I didn’t follow.

When I finally stood up, the table was empty. My phone was still there, face down now. When I picked it up, the battery was at zero. It had been fully charged before I went to sleep.

I left without keys again.

Work blurred. I kept replaying the sound in my head. The care. The restraint. Whoever—or whatever—was doing this didn’t want to scare me. That was the worst part.

When I got home, the door was unlocked.

I froze in the hallway, heart hammering, listening for movement.

Nothing.

Inside, the apartment was exactly how I’d left it.

Except for the entryway.

The keys were back.

Hanging on the hook.

But there were more of them now.

Not random keys. Not junk-drawer extras.

Duplicates.

My house key. My car key. Even the little mailbox key I’d forgotten I still carried.

Each one matched perfectly.

Each one aligned neatly.

And beneath them, taped to the wall, was another note.

Same paper. Same unfamiliar handwriting.

This one read:

Mornings are hard without them.
I’ll keep helping.

I didn’t sleep that night.

Around 3 a.m., I heard the hook creak softly.

Like it was being tested for weight.

For how much it could hold.

For how many keys it would need to remember.

I stopped taking the keys inside.

That was my solution. If I couldn’t control where they went once they were in the apartment, then they wouldn’t come in at all. I started leaving them in my car overnight, locked in the center console. It felt reckless, but at least it was a choice I made.

The first morning, nothing happened.

I woke up, checked the hook out of habit, and it was empty. No note. No duplicates. No quiet rearranging. I let myself breathe for the first time in days.

When I went down to my car, the keys were still there.

I laughed. Out loud. Too loud. Relief has a way of sounding like hysteria when it finally arrives.

That evening, I came home late on purpose. Took the long way. Sat in the car for a few extra minutes, just to be sure.

The apartment door was locked.

I unlocked it with the keys from my pocket and stepped inside.

They were waiting for me.

Not on the hook.

On the floor, directly in front of the door.

Arranged in a straight line, leading inward like a path. Each set placed carefully, teeth aligned, rings flattened so nothing overlapped. My original keys at the front. The duplicates behind them. More than there had been before.

I counted without meaning to.

Seven sets.

I backed out into the hallway and closed the door slowly, heart pounding, mind scrambling for something that made sense.

That’s when I noticed the hook.

It had been reinforced.

I don’t know how else to describe it. The metal was thicker. Cleaner. Newer than it had been that morning. The screws anchoring it to the wall were freshly turned, their slots still bright.

Something had prepared for weight.

I slept in my car that night.

When I came back in the morning, the keys were gone from the floor.

They were all on the hook.

Perfectly spaced.

Every duplicate accounted for.

There was one more note.

Smaller this time. Folded tighter. Tucked behind the keys like it wasn’t meant to be seen right away.

It said:

You don’t have to carry them anymore.
I know when you need to leave.

Since then, I haven’t lost my keys once.

They’re always where they should be when I reach for them. Always warm. Always ready.

Sometimes, when I come home, I hear the faintest sound from the entryway before I open the door.

Metal settling.

Keys being straightened.

Like someone finishing up and stepping back, satisfied with their work.

I’ve started to wonder what will happen the morning I decide not to leave at all.

Because whoever’s doing this clearly understands my routine.

And routines are easy to keep.
