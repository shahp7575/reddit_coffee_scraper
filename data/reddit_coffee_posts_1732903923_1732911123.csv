My family loves her, we did many trips around Europe together in these last two weeks and just now she boarded a plane to Brazil.

Feeling? Like I ate a pepper spray can. I haven't cried so much since my grandmother died in 2009.

Everything in my apartment reminds me of her, she left her soap, I've deleted the game ""It Takes Two"" because she's not here for us to play anymore and I'm refusing to wash her bathrobe because it still has her perfume on it.

My bed feels empty, tomorrow I'll stop making coffee because I live alone and I don't like drinking coffee alone, on Monday after work I'll come home to a cold apartment and nobody will hug and kiss me when I open the door.

My breakfast will return to being whatever I find in my fridge and not delicious toasts she usually makes for us.

I'll miss her complaining about my country being cold and me making sarcastic jokes.

Yes, it sucks, it feels bad, I hate that my profession is not remote to be able to live with her yet and I always end up blaming myself for not being able to work remotely.

Well, off to watch sitcoms and drink wine, didn't mean to make this post so depressive but I feel like a part of me died, can't wait for April next year to visit Brazil again.😔",1,1732910947.0,LongDistance,0,1.0,False

So I've been seeing this girl since the start of October, nearly 8 weeks now. She's an old flame who I dated 11 years ago but we reconnected.

Anyway so after initial chat and a couple coffee dates I asked her out to play mini golf as our first official date, which she accepted. It was a lovely night, I paid for everything, we got back to hers and there was a lot of petting and kissing, I suggested moving upstairs and she said no - okay totally fine, this was the first proper date and only two weeks in, I can respect that. 

The week after we have two more coffee dates, then she hangs out with me at my place and we watch a couple movies, I cook us dinner and we had a lovely time with a bit of cuddling and kissing, I didn't make a move this weekend. 

Following week same again, two coffee dates during the week, she comes over on the weekend, I cook, watch movies, some heavy petting ensues I suggest moving to the bedroom she says no. 

That night walking her home I tell her I'm a bit confused, she's declined my advances twice and I want to know where I stand, she says ""I know you want it, and I want it to. But it feels right to make you wait a bit"" I asked her if there is a sexual attraction and she assured me there is. 

Following week, I take us out bowling on the Friday, pay for everything, then on Saturday take us out to see fireworks and we hit the pub afterwards, and up bumping into my cousin and back at his place for karaoke and more drinks, ask her if she wants to spend the night, says no - no problem, send her home in a taxi. 

Through November we've both been busy so we've had our coffee dates in the week, but she's only spent one Saturday here chilling watching some movies, again I cooked, no advances made and I haven't brought it up. 

I'm seeing her tomorrow but I don't expect any progress. 

The following week is my work Christmas party and she is my +1, she's made a lot of effort for this, says she's really excited and she bought a nice dress to march my suit about a month ago so I feel like she's taking it seriously. 

But am I an asshole here if come the end of the party next week she doesn't stay at mine and we have sex I break it off? I feel like at this point I've been very patient, I've taken us on dates, paid for everything, cooked for her, not pressed the issue or anything, but I've never been nearly two months in and not crossed the line. 

Am I being played or am I looking too far into this? Is it worth hanging about or should I cut her loose? I've always been very sexually active in my past relationships and I worry this is a bad omen for the future. 

Trouble is, I do like this girl, we have a great time together... But if we both find each other attractive why has nothing happened yet? I'm finding it very confusing. Would love some outside input! ",1,1732910894.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

How do I get better at making out?,"So I (20M) have been talking with a girl from my uni (19F) for almost 2 months, we started liking eachother and we got pretty close pretty quick. We were pretty straight forward about what we wanted, about liking eachother  so we started to hang out, we started slow, we just talked for a couple dates.

We knew we both had no experience whatsoever so I didn't mind just holding hands and giving hugs but we both talked about how we are just been silly because we both wanted to make out so after 3 dates, yesterday we had another date. We went to the mall to buy things and have a coffee then headed to my house to watch an anime (dandadan, very good anime). 

I got us sitting on the bed, we led down and watch the series. I tried slowly to get closer to her, hold her hand and tried getting her more comfortable but she was rly nervous and i was too so i didn't want to make her uncomfortable. So we watched 2 caps of it, and when it ended she started to show me pictures about her hair, and about trips and we had some laughs but she just kept talking giving pretty much no space for me to try and kiss her. 

So in between these pauses she did when she stopped talking, analyzed the sitution, got nervous, and started talking again i just went in before she could talk, we kissed for a bit and then she got on top of me. Very cute, very nice, until we started actually making out.

Knowing we both have had no experience I was expecting it to be slow, just starting with kisses. Her tongue was wilding, she went straight in, and I didn't know what to do so I tried to follow her and tried to use the tongue aswell. I don't know if I was the problem, if she was the problem, probably we both were, but it just went horrible. 

So after humiliating ourselves she stopped said if we could just hug for a bit, talked how we were not liking, tried to go at it again, screwed it up, we laughed about it and called it off. She tried to calm me down, told me it was not that bad, that maybe it was the position we were in, that we both did bad but I was really unsatisfied with myself and felt like she felt it was my fault.

We calmed things down, talked about how it doesn't change how we see eachother and that we want to learn together, just forget about this 1st time and hope it goes better next but I am worried I am the issue so I want some tips about how to make it a good experience. I dont want to be the best at it when we meet next time, because I know it will take time, but i dont want it to be awkward, even tho she told me she won't im worried she will stop liking me if it's still bad ",1,1732910840.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1h2uan3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalBased/comments/1h2uan3/need_help_with_sick_mother/,Need help with sick mother. ,"Hi everyone I have been thriving on an animal based diet for around two years now. I am very conscious about health and I try my best to be the best version of myself as possible.

My mother has been chronically ill since 2004. Due to a medical mistake by a random hospital in a small town in the Netherlands, my mother had to have a liver transplant. She had to have her gallbladder removed because she had gall stones. After the operation a specific doctor gave her a shit ton of antibiotics. She basically overdosed for a extended period of time and this completely destroyed her liver. 
She waited for 2 years on the transplant list and got a new liver in 2006. 

Everything was fine for a while, until 2010. She got diagnosed with colitis ulcerosa. She has been getting different medication for that since she was diagnosed. She also has been taking tacrolimus/prograf a medicine used to prevent your immune system from attacking your new organ. Diet has never been a point of concern. 

In the last 20 years my mother has been eating basically whatever she wants. Although my parents and especially my mom is pretty health/food conscious, I would not say it is on the same (scientific) level as this community or how I treat diet. My parents do read every single label, but they would still treat themselves on a snickers ice cream bar. They never drink soda, but a margarita while going out for dinner wasn’t uncommon. My mom drank coffee, but not more than 2 a day. My parents only buy organic product. Vegetables, fruit and meat all organic. But yes also chocolate bars, and ice cream. In short they know what is good and bad, they focus on consuming mostly good products but they ‘treated’ themselves with bullshit foods/drinks basically every week. My parents did cook fresh most of the time and used minimum amounts of processed foods. 

There have been periods where my mother was less well. Because of the tacrolimus medication my mothers immune system has been quite weak. Therefore she gets sick with a simple cold or flue way intenser and longer than healthy people. This would result in periods where she would eat worse, order take away food or eat simple meals. The colitis is something that would hit her harder from time to time and comfort food or not cooking herself would make it easier for her to get through the day. 

So with this background story. 
Fast forward to 2024. 
My mother has liver cirrhosis, colon cancer, colitis ulcerosa. 

The liver cirrhosis and colon cancer were discovered this year. Having colitis ulcerosa for that many years without dietary treatment most likely (my opinion) has transformed into colon cancer. Because her gut was already not functioning well with the colitis ulcerosa I can imagine her liver has been damaged through the years. Together with all the intense medication my mother has been taking and just ignoring the pain (doctors telling her they don’t know what’s up etc) the rest of her body has been taking hits. Lifestyle, diet and heavy medication has lead to eventually liver cirrhosis and cancer. 

The colon cancer was removed 2,5 months ago with surgery. She has been recovering first in the hospital and since the beginning of October at home. She lost a ton of weight in the hospital. The hospital by the way had the craziest terrible food menu I have ever seen. You can order basically everything that destroys your metabolism. 

So. For 2-3 weeks my mother has been on a strict carnivore diet, that right not we are transforming in more of an animal based diet.  I’ve been back in the Netherlands since 5 November. We first started with an animal based diet. But since she didn’t react too well on every single animal based food, we decided to try a strict carnivore diet. Bone broth, kefir, meat, salt, water, tea. 
The problem with strict carnivore diet for my mother is 2 things. Diarrhea and weight loss. My mother doesn’t seem to get fat adjusted, and she keeps losing weight. I don’t believe she is losing muscle weight, although she doesn’t have a lot of fat. She is almost a skeleton, she lost a ton of weight in the hospital, just laying around doing nothing and getting real crap food that she didn’t want to eat either. 
My idea is now that my mother needs to eat more fiber, in terms of fruit. For the rest keep up the kefir and meat. Hydration is very important. We need to fix the diarrhea issue because she gets very weakened and depressed every time she goes to the bathroom. I am not sure what to do. I believe if she starts eating bread, or other forms of grains she will probably not have diarrhea but her colon will hurt the entire day. There is no colon pain during the day with animal based diet or carnivore. Although avocados are not being digested. In short. Extremely sensitive colon that cannot digest a bunch of stuff. Fat triggers her going to the bathroom, having diarrhea multiple times a day every day for a month is extremely exhausting. Asking for tips or any feedback/conversation. Thank you all.

I had so many car-related errands for the day— pick up my driver’s license, pick up OR/CR from the bank, take my car to the casa to get it checked. On top of these, may deadline ako na pitch deck sa work, and coding ako ng Friday so sa window hours lang ako pwede mag drive.

My ex and I live 40km apart. Nag meet kami halfway kasi malapit dun lahat ng errands ko. Nakaalis ako 11am kasi nagwork pa ako ng morning. I was already panicking. Pag dating ko sa mall where he was waiting for me, may food na na ready for me (food na I told him two days ago I was craving for) and may gelato pa. I was relieved kasi it was my first meal for the day at 1pm. Siya na yung nag drive para makakain ako sa car and makatipid ng oras. Iniwan namin yung car niya sa mall.

Sa lahat ng errands namin, he was the one who talked to the guards kung san yung office na pupuntahan, sino kakausapin, ano gagawin. I just signed papers when they asked me to. While walking, I didn’t even need to look up to see where we’re going kasi he was holding me. I was able to think clearly para sa pitch deck na I was instructing my staff to edit while I was outside.

At 5pm, nasa area pa rin kami malapit sa casa but di na pwede mag drive kasi coding na ulit. So nag stay kami for coffee and nanood ng ML tournament until 8pm. His parking fee was accumulating sa mall pero di ko man lang narinig na nagreklamo. When we got back to the mall, we checked pillows sa Tempur kasi gusto niya ako bilhan non. So naghihiga kami sa mga kama at unan doon. It was a lot of fun. Nakapili ako ng gusto ko na pillow. After that, he had this idea na lumipat kami ng mall to have pizza and beer. We raced from one mall to another on a Friday night while we were on FaceTime (ang bagal ng traffic kaya di talaga siya race lol). He was so happy.

We ate pizza. We drank beer. We played mobile games habang bumubwelo na rin para sa drive home namin. Nauna siya nakauwi ng 40 mins kasi sa SLEX yung daan niya while ako sa EDSA. It was already 1am. He usually gets sleepy at 10pm. But he waited for me to get home to thank me for the day and say good night.

Kakauwi ko lang. Sabi ko sa kanya matutulog na rin ako but I really want to write this. I feel so accomplished today. Nagawa ko lahat ng errands that I’ve been dreading and putting off for more than a year now. My pitch deck was praised by potential investors. Nakanood pa ako ng tournament na inaabangan ko, nakapag laro, nakapag hangout. My day was complete and it’s because my ex was with me.

When we were still an official couple, I used to write long paragraphs on social media declaring my love for him. And he would respond with only “thank you, I love you”. I hated it. His idea of affirming me was saying “I love you” 10x a day. I literally begged him to “use other words”. I still believe that my old self deserved to be loved with words, but boy did my ex love me so much with actions.

When I’m with him, I can turn off my brain because he takes care of everything. He’s so competent and dependable kaya I have full trust sa decisions niya. Whenever I stay sa place niya, there’s always ice sa freezer because I like my water cold. Pag gising ko, may breakfast na. He doesn’t mind if minsan siya na nga nagluto, siya pa maghuhugas. Pagkatapos ko mag shower, naka set up na yung makeshift vanity ko complete with lights pa sa computer table niya para makapag ready ako comfortably. He also doesn’t mind na sinusundo at hatid niya ako on our dates kahit na medyo LDR kami and marunong naman din ako magdrive.

I wish I recognized these things more before. But I really wasn’t ready for a relationship then kaya we had an ugly breakup. I am just so lucky na I was given another chance to experience these things again despite everything that happened between us.

Okay pwede na ako matulog. Thank you, Lord.",3,1732909936.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

I was always frustrated and couldn’t believe we spent that much in our “Groceries and Household Supplies” category. 

This month I decided to start splitting the transcriptions into subcategories. It’s tedious but I’m really happy I did it. It feels better knowing we only spend $487 on food. 

Ps. I know the coffee is expensive lol. We love it so we buy it. I order it from Detour Coffee if anyone is curious. ",12,1732909775.0,ynab,0,1.0,False

Only one keep up with my seriousness on the project. The first time we met, we clicked instantly. We laughed a lot, we had a great time. And that’s how it went, then he invited me for coffee and the drove me to my house. 
Over the days we did the project we talked every day, not even for the project. We made calls and then stayed and talk about everything. Then I followed on instagram and saw he had a girlfriend, got sad. He never talked about her (she is in our career too) 
I vanished the idea of him liking me and stared of think about him as a friend. 
We kept the calling, he even talked to me about his ex girlfriends but never about the current one. He always complimented me and asked me how I was single.  Even made the comment about him knowing I had one of his friends on close friends on insta (over the friend showed my profile and that’s when he “saw me”)
One day we talked on the phone over 4 hours. He said to me he had problems to be alone, something choosing the wrong partner. Eventually the conversation went the other way (I know this is bad) but we kind of sent each other soft nudes and talk about our kinks and what we liked.
The next day I thought that was it, our project was finished and whatever happened was the end. He kept talking to me, even if it was only to check on me. At the end of that week the messages stopped. The next week I send him a message and he never responded, the next day he sent a text to our group chat saying he was switching groups. I felt very bad, he did a great jod for that class, though we were friends or even tell me on my face. 
So I talked to him on our faculty. If he was okay and If he was changing groups for my fault. He said no, everything it’s okay. I went straight forward and told him I was very sorry about the pictures, it was very out of line. He said it was okay, I asked him to hang out a little bit. And then his girlfriend came and kissed him in front of me lol (I deserved that) 
At the end of the week he removed me from his followers.
Two weeks later I had a missed WhatsApp calling from him, I asked what he wanted and he said that his phone dialed me.

Makes me sad. His girlfriend hates me. And somehow I still have some kind of sparkle about him. Sometimes we look each other from afar but that’s all. 

Even when he came to my house to do the project we had a lot of tension but really we didn’t do anything. Sometimes he just put his hand on my leg on something idk i feel stupid ",1,1732909760.0,AskMenAdvice,1,1.0,False

1h2u5en,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catbehavior/comments/1h2u5en/cat_violently_insists_on_naked_drafty_windows/,"Cat violently insists on naked, drafty windows ","My cat Walter, really still a kitten at 8mos, is smarter than my husband and I combined.

Let me preface by saying he does have *enclosed* outdoor access. We have a fully screened porch that we let him out on 2-3x a day for as long as he wants. There's a huge tree right beside it so there's plenty of birds and squirrels to watch all day.

Our problem is that we rent. Thankfully the house has the nice thick slat blinds on all the windows and not the cheap, easily damaged ones. Which would've been destroyed months ago. 

But the house is older and the windows are very drafty - like we can see daylight in some corners. Downstairs has 3 huge windows and has gotten really cold.

During the summer, he would request to go outside by smacking the window blinds. Eventually we stopped responding to this and would get up and ignore him. Now he goes to the door and meows, which is great. 

He would also try to chew on the strings (they're the cordless kind, I mean the strings that hold the slats together). Mostly to get attention because we'd move fast to get him off of them. He's shredded quite a few strings and we obviously didn't want that to escalate to destroying the expensive blinds, so we kept them up out of reach, at the cost to our privacy.

Except in the bedroom - he wouldn't bother them until morning. But if we weren't fast enough, he would jump THROUGH the slats to look outside, despite the window in the next room being totally uncovered and having a cat perch. That problem mostly stopped when we moved the bed.

This past weekend, I'd had enough of it being cold downstairs so I got the shrink wrap insulation film stuff to stop the drafts. It was so much warmer, I think the kit paid for itself already in energy savings.

Well, Walter wasn't having it.

He's always laying next to the AC vent in the summer and splooting on the tile or glass coffee table. He was born in the shelter and lived there until we adopted him at 3mos, so I assume he was just accustomed to intense AC.

I caught him pawing at the plastic, no claws, and knew what was coming. I tried to grab him but it was too late. He got a tiny slice of it. But now there's 2 more huge holes and the cold air is coming right back in.

We thought he was just playing with it - but he knew exactly what he was doing. Because now he sleeps right in front of it.

He does sleep on the back of the couch. We could scoot it away a little but there's no room to completely remove it from the windows. He'd also just go behind and jump at the window because he knows the plastic is easily defeated. I wouldn't be surprised if I find him burrowed between the plastic and the window one day.

As for curtains - we have them in other rooms and there is strong evidence that he attempts to climb them.

Anyways - are we stuck patching the plastic film with packing tape over and over until it's just a wall of tape?

I know there's draft sealer tape but I don't think it'd help as much because the whole thing is messed up. Of course he had to target the worst window in the house!",1,1732909702.0,Catbehavior,0,1.0,False

I couldn’t take it anymore, so I confronted her. She started denying it, lying, and saying they hadn’t talked. When I asked to see her WhatsApp, she deleted the conversation, which had been there for a week and was last active three hours earlier, and then handed me her phone. I learned that she met this person in an online game before I was in her life, and two weeks after meeting, they went out for a meal and coffee. She claims there is no emotional connection and says they are just friends. In their conversations, I saw that the guy knew about me and even mocked me about certain things, and my girlfriend laughed and brushed it off. 

They talked for about an hour in the morning and an hour in the evening every day. There’s no flirting in the messages. However, the fact that she brought someone she met in a game and went out to eat with shortly after (which she normally wouldn’t do) into our relationship, and continued chatting despite the guy’s mocking attitude about me, has really upset me.

I could never ask this to my friends because I am to embarrassed so reddit is the spot. I recently moved to a new part of town and it ended up being the ""boys town"" area of my city (I actually didn't know despite being from the area). So being an oblivious dude I started hanging around bars and coffee shops and have made a good amount of new friends and most of them are gay.  

SO. We were all hanging out at one of my friends places drinking and talking about random bs. Turns out 2 of them have HIV and they were talking about it/how it affects them/when they found out etc.... I know that comes with being gay and gay sex is a much higher risk for HIV etc etc. IDC about that. I also know nothing about HIV just random google searches here and there. These guys are my good friends. we hangout all the time. We share food and vapes and drinks and go out. one of my friends friends who I guesss has a crush on me randomly ran up and kissed me at a bar one night when we were drunk. honestly, I was kind of pissed about it but let is slide cuz it was pretty innocent generally speaking. 

ANYWAY. What I am asking is there is any risk or way I can contract HIV through daily life/activities. I mean one night I stayed over there an mixed up my toothbrush with his and used it (I was drunk, I know gross....). I am not concerned I just would like some more info on this because I have no idea.

Here’s the situation:

My girlfriend has been running low on essentials like makeup and beauty products. She’s mentioned her financial struggles but continues to go out with friends for coffee, drinks, and meals. She doesn’t have steady income and relies on savings, which were originally $3,500. However, half of it is already gone, and she needs to stretch what’s left for another 10 months. She lives with her mom, who doesn’t provide financial support.

Recently, I asked her a direct question: “What money are you using to go out while saying you don’t have enough for necessities?” She got defensive, saying I was being mean and sarcastic. Later, she said, “I told you and nothing happened!” I’ve tried to clarify what she meant, but she avoided answering directly.

For context, I contribute significantly to our relationship—paying for 96% of expenses and covering her needs for months before she got her savings. I also have significant assets (rental properties, etc.), which makes me cautious about trust and feeling taken for granted. I’ve experienced situations where people expect me to take on financial burdens simply because I “have it.”

She believes she gives back in other ways, but I’m struggling to feel the balance. For example, our intimacy can be a point of tension. Sometimes I’ll hint at wanting something, but she’ll get frustrated and disengage, leaving me feeling unappreciated.

When she gave me a blowjob, it was either with teeth or a dry hand job, and it hurt like hell. I tried to tell her, but she got upset and stopped. However, she told me to tell her what she is  doing wrong so can better for me and kept saying she liked doing it for me. It's clear as day that she doesn't, and that's another topic for another day. 


TL;DR: My girlfriend struggles financially but continues to spend money socially, relying heavily on my support. I feel unreciprocated emotionally and financially, and I’m unsure how to address these issues without creating more tension. Looking for advice on how to set boundaries and communicate better.

The first night I sprinkled an unmeasured amount in my hot cocoa. That night I had strange chest pains, irregular heartbeat and couldn’t fall sleep. Figured it might be the vitamin K&D or Cod-liver oil I took. 

Kept taking it for a few days, reducing the amount to 1/2 a teaspoon as I thought maybe I was taking too much. The brain fog I’ve experienced on this is something else. When I set something down, just gone. I lost my keys 85 times a day at work, forget important papers, feel like my brain is broken. 

Social anxiety - I signed up for a violin lesson. Before my lesson I sat in the parking lot, hit with a wave of anxiety. Forced myself to go in, promptly turned around and left. I actually couldn’t do it or make my feet go further in the building. Drove home a bit bewildered and thought maybe it’s the ashwaghanda…. 

*Less motivated. I had plans to make Christmas wreaths, and gingerbread houses. I don’t really feel like doing either of those things anymore. 

Mood swings - I’ll go from really giggly and fun, making funnier jokes than usual, I actually made a couple people at work crack up laughing - mind you I’m NOT usually funny  - then going to an almost depressed like apathetic state where I don’t care about or want to do anything. Weird. 

I feel irritated at small things and snap easily. I’m usually a fairly decently patient person but since taking the ashwaghanda my patience is at 0. 

Weird depression - low energy, getting stressed about my to-do list, feeling way more tired than usual. Like seriously, feel sad and lethargic and I stopped taking it 2 days ago after taking it for about a week, but the effects seem to be lingering. 

I will add I have never been able to take anti-depressants, birth control, or pills that affect mood in any form without a bad reaction. I guess I’m just sensitive to things that alter brain chemistry (former alcohol issues, also get major anxiety when smoking weed) Which is really frustrating because I thought since ashwaghanda is natural that its effects would be mild and mostly positive. Instead the effects were intense and really awful; I’m really looking for something to help reduce stress and awful PMS symptoms I experience . 

Thinking about micro-dosing shrooms as I’ve had really positive experiences with that in the past but also think maybe I just need to live life with nothing extra but my morning coffee and eating well.

My wife and kids are supportive of me, and I realize that I am privileged to have them, but we are just one unit of a bigger family. My family is.... Divided politically. As you can imagine, I was dreading Thanksgiving.

Until now, things were pretty unremarkable. I came out, some family were supportive, others weren't, but no one yelled, called me slurs, or anything like that. But there was a handful who kept deadnaming and misgendering me. In the beginning, I shrugged it off, because this WAS new for them and I didn't come out until 33 years old. But now that I have been on HRT for 9 months, I wanted to see some progress.

So I texted my family and just asked them to stop deadnaming me. I didn't even ask them to use my new name - just keep it neutral if they're not comfortable. Thanksgiving was not bad, so I thought every thing was groovy.

Today, we had a ""work party"" to help put up a fence. I got nothing but deadnames and ""he/him"" from the second I arrived. And not followed by an oops. Just as if my text had meant nothing, or that the holiday was the only day people would respect my wishes. 

I walked off to cool down, pee, and get some coffee. At that point I was planning on going back out. But one of my aunts came storming in, calling me selfish, saying they're ""trying their best"" (which is bullshit), yelling that if I'm so sensitive I just shouldn't come around.

So I left. Then got an earful about how disrespectful that was.

I'm just so sad right now. I used to love whole family days. And my kids love all of those family members. But I just don't see a way for me to be around them any time soon.

So, my partner (33F) and I (36F) currently live in Vancouver, BC. We live in a thriving community called Mount Pleasant and we love it (except the cost of living, but otherwise we love it)! I work in healthcare and my partner is full-time freelance (and works remotely).   
  
I've been in BC for close to 15 years now and moved here from Ontario when I started my career. My partner's family is all from the USA, mostly eastern US. 

We have been talking about moving for years, but haven't actually taken the plunge, as it's very hard to leave BC. We love the access to nature, all the home-grown little businesses (coffee shops, markets, etc), and in general feel very happy here.   
  
We've talked about moving for a few reasons, mostly we will likely never be able to buy a house here and in the last few months one of my parents has become very unwell, and I've been flying back and forth to be with them. We've decided moving back ""home"" is the best idea at this point to be closer to both our families and live somewhere where buying a house would be an option. 

I'm here to ask for your thoughts on good places to live in Ontario! With my partner being full time remote, and I being in healthcare, we know that we don't necessarily need to be in a huge city like Toronto (which isn't really any more affordable anyway). As part of the LGBT community, we'd love a place that's open-minded, progressive, and welcoming (which I feel is most places these days). Ideally, it has some access to nature, lakes, and hiking (we realize this will not be the same as BC!). We'd love to live in a place where we can walk to grab coffee or to a cute cafe, with a little bit of an art scene. 

Any suggestions on cool places? My family are all in the Prince Edward Country region, and the spots we've looked into so far are Kingston and Ottawa. Since my partner's family are all in the eastern US, Kingston get's us a bit closer to the border. However, we are very open to anywhere that eliminates the 5 hour flight home this point. I also realize both of those places are very expensive, but not remotely comparable to the costs here, so that's okay. 

We realize Ontario is not BC, and I know we will not find the same hiking and access to nature, but we know there are awesome places and people everywhere and would love to hear your thoughts!!",2,1732908706.0,ontario,15,0.67,False

Remember, your thesis is your intellectual baby. It's a chance to dive deep into something you're passionate about, to argue a point, and to show off your academic chops. Think of it as your own little research adventure.
Here are a few tips to keep you sane and motivated:
 * Break it down: Don't try to tackle the whole thing at once. Break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks. Write a chapter, then a section, then a paragraph.
 * Find your happy place: Whether it's a cozy coffee shop, a quiet library, or your own bedroom, find a place where you can focus and feel inspired.
 * Don't be afraid to ask for help: Your supervisor, your classmates, your friends, and family are all there to support you. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need help.
 * Take breaks: It's important to take breaks to rest and recharge. Go for a walk, watch a movie, or just take a nap.
 * Celebrate your wins: Every little accomplishment, no matter how small, is worth celebrating. Treat yourself to something you enjoy.
And remember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes. Everyone goes through it. Just keep your head down, keep writing, and you'll get through it.

What are some of the reasons that a period is delayed? Is there anything I can do start it and get back to a healthy cycle rhythm? And at what point is a period “too late” or “missed”, is concerning, and should get checked out medically?

One reason I can definitely think of is stress. I’m in a big transition period and making important life choices with school and career. Preparation and everything included, I’ve been under extreme anxiety, some lack of sleep, and fatigue the past month or so. But other times, under similar amounts of stress, my period came just fine. So I’m not sure what’s specific reason there could be this time around.

Another reason I could think of is caffeine. My caffeine intake slightly increased this month with the lack of sleep (1-2 cups of coffee every day). But again, I’m not too sure how this would affect my cycle, considering I used to drink energy drinks last year (which I assume is stronger than coffee, I’ve quit now by the way), and still got my period.

Last one(which is least likely) is being intimate with my partner. We use secure protection of course, but I’m paranoid so I’ll definitely get it checked out to be safe and for my peace of mind.

I’ve been a lurker here for a couple of months since my symptoms have gotten worse.

Background:

I start getting acid reflux issues here and there since 2017 while I was at university. My diet was horrible! Eating a lot of junk and drinking coffee e, and having a sedentary lifestyle. However during this time it did not impact me my day to day. However after 2021, I started to get crazy cramps and would wake up at 2 am sweating withou fail. I did the h pylori test by a blood test and it came back negative. I changed my diet for a couple of months and I got better. Foolish of me! I went back to my bad habit. Now this summer (July 2024) I had experience trouble swallowing for the first time ever with shortness of breath! I went to the ER 5 times! Finally the ER took an X ray and said everything is fine but he suggested he test me for h pylori again. The test came back postive for h pylori. I did the first course of antibiotics and I got better and binged for a couple of months. Now I’m back to having symptoms. I haven’t done the retest but I think it came back?

I’ve seen a lot of post talking about the hiatal hernia and hpylori causing LPR. How can we narrow it down? Can an x ray pick up if you have a hiatal hernia?


I’m feeling really down because I don’t feel well at all!

Mucus build up 
Trouble swallowing

1h2tafn,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhiteVault/comments/1h2tafn/ranking_all_the_characters_from_goshawk_from/,Ranking all the Characters from Goshawk from Worst to Best,"
I will only be Ranking the Characters that I consider to be fundamentally important to the story. In other words, this only includes the Characters that are Exclusively introduced in Goshawk.

Characters of Goshawk:

9. Dis (VA: Hildur Magnusdottir)

Dis’s entire Character and Plot flows like a Bad Episode of Family Feud. I’m not gonna throw any Shade on Hildur’s performance, but it’s very clear she didn’t get much to work with. I wanna give Dis the Nickname ""Karen"", because every minor inconvenience is turned into a 5+ minute ordeal. I shit you not, her Character Introduction is an Unfiltered and Uncut argument with a Flight Attendant. This argument consists of Dis acting like a complete Karen for like 3 minutes, before casually mentioning that her Daughter got hit by a Car💀. Unfortunately, most sections about Dis play out in a similar way:

1. Dis encounters a Minor Inconvenience.
2. Dis gets Pissed Off.
3. Dis either Exaggerates/Overreacts to the Situation.
4. Dis pretends to be Stubborn/Insistant.
5. Dis is Overthrown/Convinced against all Odds.

Fortunately, she does get significantly better twoard the later episodes. But is Undoubtably 90% of the Issues you would/could have with Goshawk.

8. Arna (VA: Hrafnhildur Orradottir)

Arna is the embodiment of Loyalty. I find it hard to believe that she is Dis’s Daugther considering how Badass she is. She deadass jumped infront of a Speeding Car to save her Friend. Obviously, she Tanks it, and wakes up a couple days later. 

Otherwise, Orradottir gives a convincing performance as the Teenage Daugther of a Karen. 

7. Lewis (VA: Michael DelGaudio)

I personally find it Odd that Lewis is listed as a part of the Main Cast on Wikipedia. Because he is mostly abscent, and is mostly a topic of conversation rather than a participant. 

As a character, Lewis had alot of potential. As of episode 12:

- He is the only one to has seen Slim Shady.
- He is the only one who found out Jason’s secret.
- He is the only one who seems to have a somewhat decent strategy to survive.

Despite this I can’t help but feel like we’ve been mislead. Ever since he gets himself caught by Iffy & Co, he seems to have gotten very desperate. He stays awake all night keeping a watch out for Slim Shady. He never once stumbles on his account of the events. He even breaks free at some point, only to immediately corner himself by going straight to Iffy & Co again. 

It was at this point he was starting to get more involved, and my favorite part of his character came through. Which is the Dynamic and Chemistry he had with Adele. Statz had an amazing opportunity to give Lewis a redemption arc, and in some way he did. He shows genuine remorse to Adele for what has happened, and he does help Iffy contact help by explaining where his backpack is. It’s a shame they completely double back on this development when we get back to him again. Suddenly he is back to being this irredeemable  prick again. Which is a huge missed opportunity.

6. Mika (VA: Denise Halfyard)

First and foremost I must commend Denise Halfyard for her amazing performance as Mika. That said, Mika does unfortunately fall into the catagory of *Object of Endearment* rather than having any sort of Meaningfull Character Development. Mika’s one and only purpose is to be the weak, naive, and vulnerable Little Sister that motivates Iffy & Adele to persevere against all odds. A character that I imagine, has perpetual puppy dog eyes.

That said, Mika is still an important supporter in the group. She occasionally has her moments, and she isn’t necessarily a Bad Example of the *Younger & Unfullfilled Sibling* cliche. But I would still be willing to claim that Denise’s performance carries the character completely. In other words, Mika’s writting doesn’t stand out on it’s own.

5. Jean (VA: A.R. Olivieri)

In many ways, Jean is the front runner of Goshawk. He is the one who set the stage for Goshawk, and how it would be different from TWV. He was set up as this Competent, Charismatic, and Confident Character early on. It did actually seem like he was going to stick around, and that there was alot of room for Character Development:

1. He discovered the Catacombs. Setting him up as the one to eventually lead them all into the Catacombs.
2. He would be the Leader of the Group, as he knows the area the best.
3. As a Result, he would feel guilty for all the horrible stuff going on. Perhaps making him an ideal candidate to survive like Graham did.

I think that if this was TWV instead of Goshawk. Then Jean would’ve been the Main Character. But this isn’t TWV, and so Jean is abruptly killed. Setting a Standard that says *Nobody is Safe at any time or for any reason*. Which raises the Stakes a lot Higher than what we’ve ever seen from TWV, making Goshawk a lot more fresh and unpredictable than any other season so far.

4. Es (VA: Dayn Leonardson)

Es is a surprisingly well written and thought out character considering how little runtime he has. His every move is Cold, but Calculated. Particularly I love how Intelligent his Negotiations with Iffy was. Interrogating Iffy for their Location first was a Smart Move, because you tend to have the most Leverage early on. Meaning, Es knew it was pointless to try and make Iffy give back the Girls personally. Instead prioritizing getting useful information about their whereabouts before giving Iffy a compremize.

Dayn does a great job portraying Es as this indifferent veteran, that is so experienced that nothing is personal to him anymore. It genuinely seems like Es is the type of guy who would prioritize a cold beer over someones life.

3. Adele (VA: Marcy Edwards)

Adele is the perfect deuteragonist for Goshawk, and has compelling motivations as well as a great sense of self-awareness. It’s easy to write off kidnapping victims as completely harmless and mindless. But Adele is different in the sense that she is very insightful. This is more akin to how most victims of kidnapping act/have acted in such situations. She technically has just as little information as a typical victim would, in the sense that she doesn’t really have any context.

But by paying close attention to her surroundings, and reflecting on the situation. She was able to accurately predict:

A. Why they were kidnapped.
B. Their abusers appearance, mannerisms, and characteristics.
C. Their rough location & destination.

Mind you, this is before they ever meet Iffy. There is a moment in one of the episodes where we hear a muffled scream in the forest. Adele is able to almost immediately claim that this scream belonged to Es. But, what did she base this on might you ask? Well, literally just because she heared Es gasp once after stubbing his toe or something.

This keen attention to detail is something very peculiar to real life survivors of kidnappings. Which not only makes her infinitely more convincing, but also justifies her erratic behavior throughout the story.

Finally, she might just have the best VA from the entire cast of not only Goshawk, but TWV as well. Marcy has some absolutely gut-wrenching screams and lines throughout the season. One of the main attractions of Goshawk for sure.

2. Jason (VA: Shion Francois)

Unpopular Opinion, Blasphemous even, but I think Jason is the Best Antagonist we’ve ever seen from TWV. There is something about his Humanity that makes him infinitely more terrifying than the Guardians. Not only is he the first person we’ve seen that knows the Guardians Ritual to a tee. But he’s so Intimately Familiar with the process, that he is able to Stroll in and out of the Frame of Reality as it Distorts. The fact that he is able to just casually hang around a Guardian, without even achknowledging its existence, is COLD as HELL.

But the main reason Jason is so Scary is because of how Manipulative he is. I think it’s a Shame we got the Implication that Jason wasn’t Trustworthy in his short Conversation with Lewis after being Threatened by Iffy. I honestly wouldn’t have seen it coming when Mika got her Coffee. The fact that the only Hint to his Intentions boiled down to a couple of mattresses is crazy! Because even then he explained himself incredibly well, and most importantly, he was always consistent in his explanations.

Jason is what Lucas Criado should’ve been. I always hated how Lucas just turned into a madman the second he got them into the caves. We know that just seeing Guardians isn’t enough to scramble your brains, because the families arrange with the Guardians all the time. Jason, however, is even crazier than these families who’ve negotiated with the Guardians for Thousands of Years. Bro genuinely saw the ""Vault"" itself, and said:

""Fuck the Process, imma do shite myself!""

1. Iffy (VA: Lauren Tucker)

I’ll be honest and admit that Iffy was being slept on during the first few episodes. Not only is her name incredibly wierd, but Lauren Tucker’s voice is queit simular to that of Adele’s VA. Making it hard to determin which one was speaking at times. The difference is subtle, but once I was able to differentiate the two. Well, oh Boy!

Iffy transitions from being the Complacient, Humorous, and Emotional Girlfriend, to almost a Hardened Veteran within the span of like 3 Episodes. The most spectacular part about this, is that the writers have been able to give ample Justification for this Character Development. And it doesn’t just boil down to ""she lost her Boyfriend"" either. It’s clear that the Development happens for foundamental reasons that are within her control. Like Mika & Adele’s safety, which is awesome considering she was fully prepared to Sell them Out for the Sake of saving Jean’s Life Early on.

Iffy makes so many interesting choices throughout the Story, some that I honestly disagree with, until she gives and Explanation for them. I remember being extremely confused when she started pointing the Rifle at Jason. Because he had already won me over at this point, but she made a couple of really good points. These were unfortunately non-factor discrepencies in Jason’s story, but she ended up being right on the mark. 

Not too mention how Spectacular Lauren Tucker’s performance is. I would actually be willing to rank her performance above Karina, and Karina is who I consider to have been the best VA we’ve had for TWV (before Goshawk).

However, if I had to give any critisism at all. I would say it was the fact that Iffy is actually Irina Casner, Daugther of Graham Casner. But ultimately this is just a nitpick. If anything I absolutely loved the moment Iffy called Dragana and being met with this Revelation. It just undermines the writting a little bit.",1,1732907430.0,WhiteVault,0,0.67,False

We've known of each other since junior high. We've never talked ever. Why now? I've been thinking... what if he's just doing this to convert me... it's my first time saying yes to a guy asking me out because I do find him cute. But... I'm scared to get hurt. My friends say to just do it because how would I know if I like him if I don't see him in person? They also said maybe it's because you became active on instagram lately so he's been seeing more of you and he's been building up the courage to ask you out but I can't stop overthinking that I'm just being used… Since it’s my first date ever and I’m an avoidant, I’m having trouble trusting myself right now so I’d like some advice.

He's invited me in one of his bible studies once. I attended one and after listening to the sermon, I firmly said no, I found a parish to devote myself to as a choir member. He respected it and occasionally replies to my instagram stories. Two years passed and he suddenly shot a message basically saying he was ""checking in on me"" and when I asked him straightforwardly if it was about the church, he said ""no, I remember you said you weren't interested and I respect that. I just wanted to check in on you because you're someone I can't easily forget."" he continues to speak in that way, saying ""you've been on my mind more than you realize."" I played along because to be honest, I do find him cute and I've heard he's nice back in junior high and I found it flattering that he took interest in me. I had fun flirting with him. He’d update me on when he was off to work, telling me he’ll talk to me during his break which he always followed through with. So I thought he seemed genuine. He asked me out on a date, over coffee. I said yes and I was excited. 

But now, I'm starting to get doubts. I've been researching his religion, Iglesia ni Cristo, and read that he is not allowed to date a non-member. His profile picture includes him sitting in front of a scripture in the Bible. One of his three posts on instagram is him holding his diploma in front of the Iglesia ni Cristo church. I remember my best friend saying, two years ago, she was also invited to his bible studies and she attended out of politeness but has been blowing him off since then because she can't handle confrontation. I also remember him saying he became an orphan shortly after high school and a family who are INC members took him in. He does worship service two days a week so I know he's devoted.",1,1732907103.0,exIglesiaNiCristo,3,1.0,False

1h2t0es,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1h2t0es/uk_tonsillectomy_experience_nhs/,UK Tonsillectomy experience (NHS),"Decided I'd document my Tonsillectomy experience as I found the YouTube videos and Reddit posts incredibly helpful, however very American-centric. I'm hoping this post serves to keep me occupied during my recovery and helps others who may be facing the same nerves I was :)

Me: 26(f), no daily meds, healthy BMI and overall healthy individual however NEVER had a General Anesthetic before so was very scared.

Location: Yorkshire Clinic, I was surprised as this is a private hospital but my treatment was fully funded by the NHS ❤️ I live alone and had no friends who have a car or could care for me the weekend I had my surgery and my family live in Northern Ireland so I have an overnight stay and I have my own room, private bathroom and TV (thought I'd be sharing a same sex room so was dreading that!). Otherwise this is typically a day surgery as long as you have someone to look after you back home.

Surgery: 

no idea if it was stitches or cauterised, will try and find out and update.

General Anesthetic was administered via IV but I also had a mask placed on my face, I was told it was administering oxygen but it did have a metallic taste/smell as I was breathing it in. I was expecting a ""drift off then next you know you're in recovery"" as that's what I'd been told, but actually it was more as you breathe in it feels a little unnerving, like you're not getting oxygen and you feel dizzy/lightheaded and then next I knew I was dreaming! There was no fade to black. I can't remember exactly what I was dreaming about but the setting was of the hospital and I felt I'd been dreaming for aaaaaaages! Then I was woken up in recovery! When I woke up I was very tired and a little overwhelmed, the staff were so caring and kind that I started crying thanking them for taking good care of me. I had a lovely (and handsome lol) man cracking jokes, asking me about work and he even wheeled me back to my room. 

Recovery:
Day 0(post-op): You feel quite woozy and tired, I don't know why I was feeling quite emotional. I felt weak and was struggling to get myself on the bed but the staff emphasized that I could take my time and that I'm alright. I then have just been sleeping on and off all day but feeling more awake now. I was given food: egg sandwich with salad, strawberry yoghurt and decaf coffee with chocolate bourbons. I was feeling nauseous so only managed a slice and half the yogurt earlier on however after more sleeping and time has passed and drinking lots of water have been able to nearly finish the egg sandwich and yoghurt which is good. Cold water has been super soothing and to my surprise my throat doesn't feel too sore, was really sore, mucoussy and bleeding a bit post surgery, but after eating I actually feel better. American guidelines state soft food but British guidelines state the opposite - if you are in the UK follow the British guidelines as I've not had any pain meds yet but feel better after eating normal food :) I was told no orange juice as that would sting hence why I got a coffee instead, but I've not touched it.

I've been told day 5 is horrible so will update each day as I go! Wish I could post pictures as I'm also documenting this :) I have been prescribed codeine which I will start taking tomorrow, but otherwise no throat numbing spray or anything like that",2,1732906725.0,Tonsillectomy,0,1.0,False

While we've compelled UC Berkeley to install several garbage cans, things aren't moving fast enough up on Grizzly Peak - they're not doing litter cleanups, no signage has been installed, and the illegal dumping sites remain open for business. It's my hope that more massive piles and media shaming will compel Cal to spend some of its $7 billion endowment on protecting the best view in the Bay. Also, I miss your trashy little faces!

We’ll meet on **Sunday, December 15th** at **8:30 AM** for good coffee and bad donuts at the intersection of Grizzly Peak and South Park Drive, [linked here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AeJQBUgmqRMwe7Er8), then work from 9 AM until noon / laziness overtakes us. There’s plenty of flat-ground work for everyone, so the more the merrier. Technically, this cleanup will be our 13th event, but given the full moon and [human skulls on plates](https://www.berkeleyside.org/2014/01/02/human-skull-discovered-near-grizzly-peak-in-tilden-park), I'm calling it 14.

Please wear or bring the following stuff:
closed-toe hiking shoes with good grip;

long pants;

layers, a sun hat, and sunscreen;

water and snacks for a half-day’s work; and

soap and water to wash your hands when you’re done.

Please do **not** bring kids or pets - it’s not safe for them up there! Also, **any amount of rain cancels** - I'll keep an eye on the forecast and pull the plug if weather looks likely.

If you have a trash grabber, work gloves, or a reflective vest, **please bring them**. If not, I can equip like... 10 pandas.

1h2sxks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1h2sxks/first_holiday_abroad_as_a_couple_running_out_of/,"First holiday abroad as a couple, running out of things to talk about. Is this just the reality of long term relationships or is something wrong with us? ","This is my (30f) first relationship that has ever lasted more than a year. So forgive my cluelessness. 

For context, we are in our 30s and we've been together 2.5 years. We live together quite harmoniously with no big problems, and have lived together most of the relationship (we moved fast). Our relationship is respectful, loving and supportive with no big dramas. We've been away on trips together before, but it was always to visit other people - we have friends and family who live far away in various locations. We are both introverted, with him leaning more heavily towards the far end of the spectrum than me, but I'm still definitely an introvert.

This was our first holiday abroad just the two of us, for one week, in a romantic location. I probably had very high (unrealistic?) expectations. Don't get me wrong, the location is beautiful, we've seen some gorgeous places, tried some new things, eaten fabulous food and are extremely privilaged and I don't take that for granted. However, after a few days together we seem to have run out of things to say to each other. Last night we ate dinner in virtual silence and I was scrambling for something to talk about. Today we walked around a new town and occasionally we'd say something like ""isn't the weather lovely"" or ""oh, look at that building over there"", but the conversation was nothing exciting. Honestly, I've been feeling bored and resentful today. And then guilty for feeling this way because I do love him and usually our relationship is not a source of stress to me at all. We're on a romantic trip and I guess I had the expectation that every conversation would be mind blowingly meaningful. Maybe I was naieve. 

Never before have we spent an entire week together with no break. We've spent every waking minute together - from the airports to the car journeys, every meal, every walk, every sightseeing excursion, every queue and every coffee shop. Maybe we've just spent too much time together. But then another part of me is wondering... What if we aren't right for each other? 

Reddit doesn't have the answers. Just venting and looking for points of view, I suppose. As I said before, we live together. We do have quiet times at home and it doesn't bother me - in fact it's quite peaceful - but on holiday it has bothered me a lot. ",3,1732906520.0,AskWomenOver30,11,0.8,False

1h2srp2,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1h2srp2/ive_been_hired_to_follow_people_for_a_living/,I’ve been hired to follow people for a living,"I’ve always felt alone. Not just lonely, but truly, utterly alone. I’ve never had a friend either. My father died when I was eight, leaving my mother to raise me on her own. There were no siblings, no distant cousins, no extended family dropping by to fill the empty spaces. To this day, I’m not even sure if anyone else in my family exists outside of her.

She was all I had, and she never let me forget it. ""The world is dangerous,"" she would say, her voice low and firm, as though even speaking too loudly might invite unseen threats. That was her excuse for keeping me isolated, for not allowing me to have friends. Not that it mattered—I didn’t exactly attract people anyway. At school, I was the outcast, the one everyone avoided, like they could sense something was wrong with me. Something broken.

The day after my high school graduation, cancer finally claimed her. It was slow, silent, and inevitable, like the world had decided to erase her in the same quiet way it had erased every other connection in my life. And with her gone, I was truly alone.

I tried to make a life for myself, but it was like patching together a broken mirror—every reflection of me was distorted. I hopped from one odd job to the next: baggage handler at the supermarket, flipping burgers at the diner, delivering meat for a factory. None of it stuck. None of it made me feel any less invisible. I thought maybe working around people would force me to connect, but no one even noticed me. I felt like a ghost, drifting between the living.

My last job—cleaning animal excrement—was a fitting end to that chapter of my life. It was, quite literally, a crappy job. I was fired after three months, but honestly, I didn’t care. By then, I had stopped expecting anything from life.

That’s when I saw the ad online. 

*Looking for a sharp eye and discretion. No experience required. Join Undercover Inc.*

I didn’t even think twice before applying. The job was to follow people. That’s it. Tail them, watch them, report back. It should’ve raised a few red flags, but at that point, I wasn’t fazed by much of anything. *What should it matter? I was just a nobody anyway.* 

The interview was held in an unmarked building on the outskirts of the city. Its exterior was unremarkable—gray walls, no signage, and windows tinted so dark they felt more like voids. I almost walked past it, thinking I had the wrong place, but the text on my phone confirmed the address.

Inside, the air was thick, the kind of silence that swallowed sound whole. A receptionist, who barely looked up from her desk, pointed me toward a single door at the end of a long hallway. I don’t know why, but every step I took made my stomach churn a little more.

The room I entered was small, with stark fluorescent lights that buzzed faintly overhead. A man sat behind a desk, wearing a suit that seemed one size too big for him. His face was pale, his hair slicked back, and his eyes… they didn’t blink as much as they should.

""Take a seat,"" he said, motioning to the only chair in the room.

I sat. The chair creaked beneath me, loud enough to make me flinch.

He leaned forward, his thin lips curling into a smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes. ""You’re here for the position?""

I nodded.

He glanced at a paper on the desk, though it seemed blank from where I was sitting. ""No experience, I see. Perfect. We don’t like people who know too much.""

I wasn’t sure how to respond, so I stayed quiet.

His gaze met mine, sharp and unwavering. ""Tell me, have you ever felt like you’re being watched?""

The question caught me off guard. ""Uh… not really.""

""Interesting,"" he murmured, scribbling something on the blank paper. ""And do you believe in coincidence?""

I hesitated. ""I… I guess?""

He tapped his pen against the desk, the rhythm irregular, almost agitating. ""You guess. Hmm. Tell me, if you had to follow someone for weeks, months even, and they started to… notice you, would that scare you?""

I blinked. ""I don’t think so?""

His smile widened, showing teeth that were just a bit too straight, too white. ""Good. Fear complicates things.""

""Is this… normal for the job?"" I finally asked, unable to keep the unease out of my voice.

""There’s nothing normal about life, wouldn’t you agree?"" He leaned back, his shadow stretching across the desk like it was alive. ""Last question. If the person you were following looked directly at you and asked, *Who are you? Why are you here?*—what would you say?""

I froze, the hypothetical question feeling heavier than it should. ""I… I don’t know.""

He clapped his hands together once, the sound echoing too loud in the tiny room. ""Perfect answer. You’re hired.""

""Just like that?""

""Just like that,"" he said, standing up and extending his hand. His grip was cold, like shaking hands with a mannequin. ""Welcome to Undercover Inc. Your first assignment will arrive tomorrow. Don’t worry about the details—you’ll get them when you need them. Just be ready.""

I left the building with the strangest feeling, like I’d just signed a contract without reading the fine print. And as I stepped back into the city’s bustling streets, I couldn’t shake the sensation that someone was already following me.

The next morning, my phone buzzed with a new email. It was from Undercover Inc., 

I opened it immediately, half-expecting more cryptic questions or vague instructions. Instead, it was surprisingly straightforward:

**Details:**

Name: Henry L. Newman

Age: 46

Occupation: Accountant

Address: 218 Waverly Drive

Assignment Duration: 7 days

Objective: Document his day-to-day activities. Submit a report at the end of each day.

**Compensation:** $22/hour

Note: Do not approach the subject or engage in conversation. Maintain distance and observe discreetly.

$22 an hour. I couldn’t help but let out a low whistle. That was more than I’d ever made at any of my previous jobs, and all I had to do was follow some guy around? Easy money, or so it seemed.

The email also included an attachment—a photo of Henry. It was a grainy image, like something taken from a security camera. He looked average: thinning hair, glasses perched on his nose, and a slight slouch to his posture. There was nothing remarkable about him, just an ordinary man in an ordinary blazer.

Still, something about the lack of information gnawed at me. Why was I supposed to follow him? Why him, out of all people? But the email had been clear—I wasn’t paid to ask questions.

I clicked on the address link, which opened a map. Henry lived in a small suburban neighborhood about 20 minutes away from me. I didn’t have a car, but the bus route was direct enough. I jotted down the directions and set a reminder for tomorrow morning.

The rest of the day felt surreal. I kept rereading the email, trying to glean some hidden meaning, but there was nothing there. The instructions were almost clinical in their simplicity.

Who was Henry L. Newman? And why would anyone care about his ""day-to-day activities""?

I looked up the address on my laptop. 218 Waverly Drive was part of a quiet cul-de-sac, lined with trimmed hedges and identical white mailboxes. Perfectly normal.

Maybe he was under investigation? Maybe someone thought he was hiding something? But if that were the case, wouldn’t this be a police matter? My mind spun with possibilities until I finally forced myself to stop. None of it mattered. All I had to do was watch, report, and collect my paycheck.

For the first time in years, I felt a small flicker of excitement. Sure, it was a weird job, but it was something different. Something I hadn’t done before. And the money wasn’t bad, either.

Tomorrow, I’d meet Henry L. Newman—not literally, of course. Just from a distance. I’d watch his life unfold for a week and, hopefully, learn nothing more than what I needed to know.

The next morning, I was up before my alarm. A mix of nervousness and curiosity pushed me out of bed earlier than usual. After a quick breakfast, I grabbed a notebook and pen—tools I hadn’t been instructed to bring but figured might be useful—and headed for the bus stop.

The ride to Waverly Drive was uneventful, the kind of quiet suburban scenery you see in real estate brochures. By the time I got off the bus, the sun was creeping higher in the sky, casting long shadows over the pristine neighborhood.

I found 218 Waverly Drive easily enough. It was exactly as Google Maps had shown: a modest, two-story home with beige siding, a neatly trimmed lawn, and a single, leafless tree in the front yard. A black sedan was parked in the driveway. Nothing about the house stood out—no glaring oddities, no ominous vibe. It was just... normal.

I settled on a bench at the small park across the street, positioned behind a pair of large oak trees that gave me a clear view of the house while keeping me hidden.

At 8:07 a.m., the front door opened, and Henry stepped out.

He was even more unremarkable in person: a middle-aged man with an average build, wearing a beige jacket and slacks. He carried a brown leather briefcase in one hand and a travel mug in the other. He walked to the black sedan, got in, and backed out of the driveway with the precision of someone who’d done it a thousand times before.

I followed him by bus as best as I could, keeping track of his movements through the streets. He drove to a small, nondescript office building downtown and disappeared inside. I noted the time—8:37 a.m.—and decided to hang around.

For the next eight hours, Henry did exactly what you’d expect an accountant to do.

I watched from a café across the street as he sat at his desk, visible through the large office window. He worked on his computer, shuffled papers, and occasionally answered the phone. At noon, he stepped out to grab a sandwich from the deli next door, then returned to eat at his desk.

By 5:15 p.m., he left the building and drove straight home. No stops, no detours. Once inside, he pulled the curtains shut, and I lost sight of him.

I scribbled my notes into the notebook and emailed the day’s report:

**Subject:** Day 1 Report

**Time Observed:** 8:07 a.m. – 5:37 p.m.

**Notes:** Subject left residence at 8:07 a.m., arrived at workplace at 8:37 a.m. Routine office work observed. Lunch break at 12:15 p.m. Returned home at 5:37 p.m. No anomalies.

It felt... mundane. Almost too mundane. I’d expected something to stand out—a suspicious meeting, strange behavior, *anything*. But Henry’s day was painfully average.

As I lay in bed that night, my thoughts spiraled. Why did someone want me to follow Henry? What was the point? It didn’t make sense.

Still, it was just the first day. Maybe tomorrow would reveal more. Or maybe I’d find out that normalcy itself could be the most unsettling thing of all.

The week following Henry L. Newman was mind-numbingly dull—at first. Each day began the same way: he’d leave his neatly kept home on Waverly Drive at precisely 8:07 a.m., briefcase in hand, travel mug at the ready. He’d drive to his bland office downtown, where he’d sit at his desk, immersed in spreadsheets and phone calls. By noon, he’d grab a sandwich from the deli next door, eat at his desk, and continue his work until clocking out around 5:15 p.m.

The first few days felt pointless. Henry seemed utterly ordinary, almost frustratingly so. But by midweek, something shifted.

Wednesday, instead of heading straight home after work, Henry turned off the main road and parked outside a dimly lit motel on the edge of town. My heart raced as I watched him exit his car and walk briskly to Room 214. Fifteen minutes later, a woman joined him—blonde, younger, and definitely not his wife. They stayed inside for an hour before leaving separately.

Thursday was a repeat performance. The woman arrived at the motel before Henry this time, dressed in business casual but with a certain air of secrecy. I jotted down every detail, my stomach twisting as I realized what I was witnessing.

By Friday, their routine was clear: the clandestine meetings weren’t a fluke. Henry had built a double life, his mundane facade hiding something far more complicated.

Each night, I submitted my reports, carefully leaving out the affair. Something about it felt... wrong. Was this really the purpose of my job? To expose secrets that weren’t mine to uncover?

By the end of the week, I didn’t just know Henry’s patterns—I knew his lies. And I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone was watching me just as closely.

My next assignment was for Marcy L. Durant. The file painted her as a chameleon—a fraudster and con artist who changed identities like others changed clothes. From fake charities to elaborate romance scams, Marcy left a trail of empty bank accounts and shattered lives. The email offered little else: a photo of a smiling brunette with sharp eyes, a list of addresses that spanned three states, and a single instruction—""Track her movements. No direct contact.""

She wasn’t too much exciting, just a mere fraudster. But the more the most exciting assignment for me after three or four more assignments was the one for a guy named Ethan Cross. He was a creepy guy. This is what the email showed me.

**Details:**

**Name:** Ethan Cross

**Age:** 38

**Occupation:** Unknown

**Address:** (REDACTED)

**Assignment Duration:** 7 days

**Objective:** Follow and document his day-to-day activities. Report any irregular or suspicious behavior.

**Compensation:** $30/hour

**Note:** This assignment is different. **Trust your instincts.** Keep your distance and observe discreetly, but be cautious—something about this subject doesn’t sit right. We don’t have any concrete evidence of criminal activity yet, but we suspect there’s more than meets the eye. You’ll understand why soon enough. Do not approach or engage with the subject.

The first day I followed Ethan Cross, I felt a sense of unease, though I couldn’t pinpoint exactly why. He looked normal—almost too normal. A tall, well-dressed man with slicked-back hair and a black overcoat, like someone stepping out of an old noir film. The kind of guy who would command attention just by walking into a room. He exuded an effortless charm, greeting everyone with a smile that felt a little too practiced, a little too perfect.

Ethan's routine was oddly structured, almost mechanical. He left his house promptly at 8:00 a.m., grabbed a coffee from the same café each day, and always spoke with the barista by name, as though they were old friends. Yet, there was something off about it. His interactions were too smooth, his gestures too rehearsed. I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was playing a part—a role he’d perfected over the years.

I followed him to his office building, a sleek, glass-and-steel structure downtown. He wasn’t listed as an employee there, yet he walked inside like he owned the place. I waited outside, watching as he disappeared into the lobby, not once glancing over his shoulder. Hours later, he reappeared, briefcase in hand, his demeanor unchanged, as if nothing had happened.

I continued to follow him the next few days, noting his frequent visits to a nearby hotel. Each time, he seemed to be checking into a different room, leaving after a few hours with the same calm demeanor. Who was he meeting? What was he doing there?

On the fourth day, I saw him leave the hotel with a woman—her features hidden by a dark scarf—but I caught a glimpse of her face as she entered the black sedan with him. She looked... frightened. And that’s when I started to realize that Ethan Cross wasn’t just charming—he was dangerous. The cracks in his perfect façade were starting to show, and I was beginning to wonder if I was just a witness, or if I was becoming part of something far darker.

By the fifth day, the unease in my gut had turned into something far more intense. Ethan Cross’s charm was no longer just a performance—it was a mask. A carefully constructed front that hid something far more sinister. The more I observed him, the more I noticed things that didn’t add up. Small things, like the way his reflection in the store window never seemed to match his movements exactly, or the strange way his voice would fluctuate when he spoke to certain people, as though he wasn’t entirely present.

The hotel visits were becoming more frequent. But it wasn’t just the oddity of his schedule that unsettled me—it was his demeanor. Every time he returned to his car, there would be blood on his coat sleeve, a faint smear at his collar, like he had been handling something he shouldn’t have. I wanted to believe I was imagining it, but when I started to follow him further, I couldn’t ignore the growing evidence.

On the sixth day, I followed him again, but this time, I made sure to stay farther back. He led me to an abandoned building on the edge of town—an old warehouse with rusted metal doors and boarded-up windows. I watched from across the street, too far to be seen but close enough to catch the faintest of movements. Ethan entered the building, and I waited, my mind racing with possibilities.

Two hours later, I saw him leave, but he wasn’t alone. A woman stumbled out of the building, disoriented and shaking. She was wearing the same dark scarf I’d seen before, but this time, it was covered in blood. Her eyes were wide with terror, and her clothes were torn, as though she’d fought to get away. Ethan, his usual calm demeanor unwavering, calmly walked her to his car. As he opened the door for her, I saw it. There was no fear in his eyes, just something... hollow. As if he were detached, performing a task, not as a man, but as something else entirely.

I followed him again that night. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was on the verge of uncovering something far darker than I could comprehend. As the hours passed, I kept seeing the same patterns: women, often from the same hotels, disappearing into that warehouse. But something in the back of my mind kept nagging at me. 

When I reported my findings back to my employers, Ethan Cross was gone. He seemed to have vanished into thin air, like he never existed at all. There was no trace of him, no sign that anyone had ever seen him. The warehouse was abandoned, desolate. It was as if the world had wiped him from its memory. But it wasn’t just him. Every single person I had been tasked with following—Henry Newman, the fraudster, the woman I had watched, the others—had disappeared too. Like they were nothing more than figments of my imagination, erased from existence.

I sat there, staring at the computer screen, a strange emptiness settling in the pit of my stomach. I scrolled through the reports, trying to make sense of what had happened, but there were no answers. The assignments had just… ended. No more updates, no more instructions. Like everything had been scrubbed from the records.

But it didn’t matter to me. I had done my job. I had followed the orders, observed every detail, and documented the patterns. It wasn’t my responsibility to figure out the why, the how, or the what next. My employers paid me for my discretion, for my ability to follow without asking questions. They didn’t pay me to care. They paid me to work, to remain anonymous, to keep my head down and do as I was told.

And that’s what I did. No questions, no thoughts about the strange disappearances, the eerie feeling I had whenever I looked back at my notes. It was over, and I had my paycheck. That’s all that mattered. It was just another assignment, another job done.

I shut down my computer, grabbed my coat, and walked out into the night. The city felt colder than usual, but maybe that was just me. Either way, I didn’t care.

I've been doing this job for a while now, long enough that it’s become a part of me. Not just something I do to pay the bills, but something I’ve woven into the fabric of my existence. I’ve become so good at it that it no longer feels like work. It feels like living in the shadows—where no one can see me, and I can see everything. Like a ghost, I move unnoticed, slipping between people and places without leaving a trace.

I don’t even think about it anymore. I’ve mastered the art of blending in, of becoming invisible. It’s a skill, one that I’ve honed over time. The art of observation, of moving without being noticed, of being present without ever being acknowledged. People look right past me now. It’s like I’m not even there. Sometimes, they’ll glance behind them, a flicker of suspicion in their eyes, but by the time they turn around, I’ve already disappeared into the crowd, swallowed up by the dark. They never really see me. They just feel something, a fleeting sense of something there, and then it’s gone.

I’ve become a shadow, a part of the background. And in a strange way, it’s comforting. I don’t need to be seen. I don’t need to be remembered. I don’t even need to exist in any meaningful way. I’ve become a master of my own disappearance. I’m not even sure if I care about anything anymore.

This job—it’s consumed me. It’s all I have now. I follow, I observe, and then I report. I don’t ask questions. I don’t question why I’m doing it. There’s a numbness to it, an emptiness that I’ve come to accept. And the more I do it, the more I sink into it, the more I feel like I’m slipping away. Like I’m fading, becoming less and less of a person, more of a presence, a faint outline in the corners of the world that no one notices.

I’ve learned to embrace it. This life in the dark. It’s my world now, the only one I know. And as long as I keep moving through it, I’ll stay invisible. Unseen. Unnoticed. A ghost in the crowd.

I knew it was going to be rough because I take the muscle relaxer for neck pain from a car accident I had when I was 20. With the relaxer, I have less migraines. So I had to take low dose Tylenol to replace it.

8 days ago I went for my quarterly Botox for migraine. Immediately following I began suffering a migraine. It’s Thanksgiving week here in the states so when it became severe, I began going through every possible remedy.

10 mg sativa chocolate edible
Migraine ice hat made in Canada 
Musinex 
Listening to DARE (remix) by Gorillaz
Face massage
Butalibitol (caffeine, Tylenol, not sure what else.)
Coffee

Hi, coffee lovers! ☕

I recently bought a second-hand chrome Vertuo machine, which is supposed to be less than a year old. Unfortunately, it’s been delivering **super watered-down coffee** ever since I got it. 😩

# What I’ve Tried:

1. **Contacted Customer Service**: They were helpful and walked me through a reboot and other troubleshooting steps. Sadly, no luck – it’s still the same.
2. **Outcome from Customer Service**: They informed me that because I bought the machine second-hand, they can’t provide further support. So, I’m on my own here.

# Additional Context:

* I’ve only used **Starbucks pods** with this machine. Could this be the issue?
* I’ve heard that the machine reads barcodes on the pods, so I’m wondering if the Starbucks ones could somehow be causing the problem?

# My Questions:

1. Could it actually be the pods, or is this just a coincidence?
2. Is there any DIY fix for Vertuos to improve brewing performance?
3. Any other suggestions for troubleshooting, given the second-hand situation?

I’m really bummed – I love the way it looks on my home office sideboard, and it would be amazing to enjoy that little luxury from time to time during my working hours. Any advice or shared experiences would be super appreciated! 🙏",1,1732905705.0,nespresso,1,1.0,False

**Issue #4: “Family Ties”**



**Page Count:** 40 Pages

**Rating:** R (Profanity, Mature Themes)

  


**Opening Scene (Pages 1-4): Bringing It Home**



*Scene: Late night in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn.*



Jordyn (Nightflare) teleports onto the fire escape outside his apartment, a duffle bag of stolen cash slung over his shoulder. He steps into his room through the window, removes his hooded jacket, and quietly walks into the living room. His mom, Rhea, sits on the couch, waiting for him. The tension in the air is palpable.



**Rhea**: *(sternly)* *“Where did you get that from?”*



Jordyn places the duffle bag on the coffee table without responding, his expression detached.



**Rhea**: *(raising her voice slightly)* *“Jordyn, I asked you a question. Where did you get that money?”*



**Jordyn**: *(calmly)* *“Don’t worry about it.”*



Rhea’s face tightens with frustration as she stands, her voice trembling with emotion.



**Rhea**: *“I’m tired of being told not to worry. You not fucking twenty-five, Jordyn—you’re sixteen.”*

  


**Page 5-10: The Argument**



**Jordyn**: *(crossing his arms)* *“What’s that supposed to mean?”*



**Rhea**: *(yelling)* *“It means that whatever you’re doing isn’t something you’re supposed to be doing. I worry every night that the only thing I have left in this world won’t walk through that door.”*



Jordyn’s expression hardens, his voice cold and clipped.



**Jordyn**: *“Don’t you get tired of walking through that door into this house with the rest of the family nowhere to be fucking found?”*



He gestures around them, his voice rising.



**Jordyn**: *“Came up, that’s all me, Ma. Stayed true, that’s all me. No. Help. That’s all me. This.”* *(gestures to the house, the lights, the fridge)“The house. The lights. The food in the fridge for the last two years has been. All. Fucking. Me.”*



Rhea’s face twists in a mixture of anger and pain. Without even thinking, she slaps Jordyn across the face, the sound echoing in the small apartment.



**Rhea**: *(furious, in French)* *“Tu regardes ta putain de bouche garçon!”* (*Watch your damn mouth, boy!*)

  


**Page 11-15: A Breaking Point**



Jordyn touches his cheek where she slapped him, the brief shock flickering across his face before his cold mask returns. His voice lowers, his words sharp.



**Jordyn**: *(in French)* *“Très bien alors, maman. Très bien.”* (*Fine then, Mom. Fine.*)



He turns and grabs his jacket, heading for the door. Rhea stumbles forward, reaching for him, her voice cracking.



**Rhea**: *“Jordyn, wait. I didn’t mean—”*



But the door slams shut behind him before she can finish. Rhea collapses back onto the couch, burying her face in her hands. The duffle bag of cash sits untouched on the table, a bitter reminder of the price Jordyn has paid—and the price she has paid, too.

  


**Page 16-25: Jordyn’s Escape**



*Scene: Rooftops of Brooklyn.*



Jordyn teleports to a rooftop, his emotions swirling as he looks out over the city. His inner monologue reveals his conflicted thoughts.



**Jordyn (internal monologue):** *“This ain’t fair. None of it. I’ve done everything for her. For us. And all she does is worry, complain, or yell. Like I got another choice? Like there’s some magic way to fix this without getting my hands dirty?”*



He clenches his fists, purple lightning crackling around them.



**Jordyn (internal monologue):** *“She don’t get it. No one does. It’s all on me. Always has been.”*



He teleports to another rooftop, trying to calm himself, but the memory of her slap lingers.

  


**Page 26-30: Rhea’s Regret**



*Scene: Back in the apartment.*



Rhea stares at the duffle bag, her hands trembling. She knows where the money came from and what it means, but her anger has given way to guilt.



**Rhea (internal monologue):** *“He’s just a boy. My boy. And I slapped him like some stranger.”*



She looks around the apartment, the food in the fridge, the lights on, and the rent paid—all thanks to Jordyn’s sacrifices.



**Rhea (internal monologue):** *“I failed him. I let him carry it all alone. But I’m scared. Scared I’m going to lose him. Just like I lost everything else.”*



Tears stream down her face as she whispers into the empty room.



**Rhea**: *“I’m sorry, Jordyn.”*

  


**Page 31-35: Jordyn’s Resolve**



*Scene: An abandoned rooftop at dawn.*



Jordyn sits on the edge of a building, the first light of morning breaking over the horizon. He takes a deep breath, trying to push the pain aside.



**Jordyn (internal monologue):** *“Family’s supposed to have your back. Supposed to make it easier. But not me. Not us.”*



He stands, adjusting his hood and gloves as the purple energy around him intensifies.



**Jordyn (internal monologue):** *“Fine. I’ll handle it my way. Same as I always have.”*



He teleports away, disappearing into the city’s skyline.

  


**Epilogue (Pages 36-40): Watched from Afar**



*Scene: Cerebro Chamber at Xavier’s School.*



Professor X sits in deep thought, reviewing Jordyn’s most recent actions. His expression is grim, but there’s a glimmer of hope in his eyes.



**Professor X**: *(to himself)* *“Pain drives you, Jordyn. But it also blinds you. I only hope I can reach you before it’s too late.”*



The issue ends with Jordyn perched on another rooftop, the city stretching before him, his face a mix of defiance and determination.



**TO BE CONTINUED…**

Overcoming H2 SIBO: My journey to recovery through diet, supplements, and persistence

Hello everyone,

I wanted to share my success story in overcoming H2 SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth). I’m currently 37 years old, weighing 76 kilos.

Before SIBO:
I could eat everything without any problems. Over the past decade, however, I developed a strong addiction to sugar,mostly chocolate, ice cream, and candy and snacked heavily throughout the day. My weight peaked at 95 kilos (I’m 1.85m tall), making me slightly overweight but not severely. My bloodwork was generally fine, though I occasionally had folate deficiencies. I didn’t recall any food poisoning incidents or other health issues.

The Journey Begins:

January 2021:
Around three years ago, I started experiencing significant digestive issues, including constant belching, delayed burps, and difficulty lying down after meals. Lying down would cause immense burping, and I could still taste food in my burps 8 hours after eating. I also began feeling extreme fatigue during the day, often needing naps even during work hours, which worsened my digestion since food stayed in my stomach while lying down. This all happened before COVID btw.

Diagnosis and Initial Attempts

August 2022: 
I was officially diagnosed with H2 SIBO via a lactulose breath test. My doctor prescribed antibiotics, but I was hesitant and decided to try alternative methods first. I reduced sugar, stopped snacking, adopted intermittent fasting, and added supplements like HCL (to increase stomach acidity), ginger and artichoke. I also quit coffee.  
  Despite following this regimen for five months, my symptoms didn’t improve, though I did lose weight.

Medical Treatments

February 2023:
 I decided to follow my doctor’s prescribed treatments, which included:
  - Flagyl 500mg for 10 days (antibiotic)
  - Ciprofloxacin 500mg for 10 days (antibiotic)
  - ADP (Anti-Dysbiosis Product, a supplement)  

  This first round of antibiotics brought no significant relief.  

April 2023:
 My doctor suggested repeating the treatment, so I went through another round of the same antibiotics and supplements.  

Health Challenges

June 2023:
I began experiencing heart palpitations and minor panic attacks, something I had never experienced before. Heart tests revealed no underlying issues.  

After two years of living with SIBO, I had lost weight (dropping from 95kg to 70kg) and was still dealing with delayed burping, digestive discomfort and fatigue.

July 2023: 
With no improvement, my doctor recommended trying a more expensive antibiotic alongside a new supplement regimen. I took:
  - Xifaxan 550mg (like Normix) for 2 weeks with Phgg.
  - Ginger, artichoke, B12, and gut-healing supplements for 2 more months  

  These treatments provided only mild symptom relief.

Exploring Other Options:

At this point, I began researching alternatives. Having tried most antibiotics, supplements, and lifestyle adjustments, my remaining options were:
1. An elemental diet  
2. A carnivore diet  

October 2023:
I opted for the carnivore diet after months of research and learning about a Scandinavian study where 6 patients with H2 SIBO went from positive to negative after six weeks of zero-carb eating. My doctor was supportive but cautious.  

Carnivore Diet Experience:
I followed the carnivore diet strictly for 9 months. It was challenging at first due to electrolyte imbalances and initial detox symptoms, including rashes. Over time, I learned a lot about my food sensitivities:
- Cheese caused severe constipation.  
- Cow milk made me feel off.  

Regular bloodwork showed no deficiencies, though I had mild folate deficiency, which I addressed by eating more liver.

- Progress during carnivore:
  - At 2 months: Almost negative for SIBO 
  - At 6 months: Officially negative for SIBO  
  - Symptoms like belching and delayed burping reduced by about 95%. However, I experienced fatigue after meals, which improved with magnesium citrate and MTHFR folate supplements (inspired by my brother’s gene testing results).  

The final three months of the carnivore diet were smooth. My digestion, stool quality, and energy improved, though I didn’t experience the dramatic benefits some carnivore dieters report.

Transitioning Off Carnivore:

June 2024: 
After 9 months, I began reintroducing fruits and slowly incorporated other carbs like bread and pasta. To address lingering symptoms, my doctor recommended: -Toxaprevent, a powder that binds to and removes heavy metals, toxins, and mold from the gastrointestinal system.  
 I took Toxaprevent for one month and noticed significant improvement. 

Current Status:
I can now eat anything without issues, no more belching or discomfort, and I can lie down after meals without problems. I’d say I’m 99% healed and not taking any supplements atm.

Key Takeaways:
The measures I believe helped me overcome H2 SIBO include:  
1. The carnivore diet (full of b vitamins and gut healing properties)
2. Magnesium citrate for keeping it moving and soft stool  
3. Toxaprevent to address lingering symptoms (and possible heavy metals, mold and other issues)
4. Avoiding cheese to prevent constipation  

Future Plans:
I plan to repeat the following for 1-2 months at a time each year as maintenance:  
- Carnivore diet  
- Toxaprevent supplement
- MTHFR folate supplement  
- Magnesium citrate  

Final Thoughts:
While I couldn’t identify the root cause of my SIBO, I believe a combination of these interventions helped resolve it. It’s been a challenging journey, but healing is possible with persistence and effort.  



The study I referenced:  
- *""A Zero Carbohydrate, Carnivore Diet can Normalize Hydrogen Positive Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth Lactulose Breath Tests: A Case Report""* – Available online and discussed by the author on YouTube.  

Good luck to everyone working toward recovery, it’s hard work, but it’s achievable!

When starting a business, the first thing many entrepreneurs consider is building their own website. Websites seem like a must these days, especially when you’re trying to establish a brand. If you’re not a developer, you’ll likely turn to website-building tools like Shopify, WordPress, Wix, or GoDaddy. You’ll secure a domain name, set up a professional email address, and design your website by adding a few pictures, some text, a contact page, and an about section.

>You can check [the website](https://thedatering.com/) I created for my product

Building a website can be surprisingly affordable — some claim it’s as cheap as a cup of coffee. Sounds great, right? However, as you dive deeper, you’ll notice your website might not look as professional as established brands. You may spend more time tweaking it, striving to create something visually appealing and functional. Website-building platforms entice you with low starting prices, but over time, the hidden costs begin to surface.

Initially, building and hosting your site may seem cheap, but no one wants a site cluttered with ads or stamped with a website builder’s logo. To remove these, you’ll need to pay extra fees. While these costs might seem manageable, they quickly add up if you want to create a polished, professional-looking website.

# Turning Your Website Into a Money Machine — But at What Cost?

If you plan to sell products online, you’ll need to enhance your website with features like product listings, payment options, and e-commerce tools. Unfortunately, these upgrades are often not included in the basic plans. You’ll have to pay extra for these features, and while that might make sense if your website generates significant sales, it can be frustrating if sales are slow or nonexistent. Yet, the fees persist whether you make sales or not.

Why is the system designed this way? The answer is simple: most businesses and individuals fail. When starting something new, we’re often overly optimistic, assuming our products will sell quickly. However, statistics show that about 90% of businesses fail to meet their expectations. Website-building companies are well aware of this. Rather than charging a small commission on sales, they prefer to lock you into expensive e-commerce packages. And even when you make a sale, there are still service fees to pay.

# Selling Shovels Instead of Searching for Gold

Platforms like Shopify and Wix are immensely helpful for entrepreneurs, but their business models are designed to profit regardless of your success. They provide tools for creating websites and e-commerce stores, but they also rely on your excitement and optimism. In this way, they’re like sellers of shovels during a gold rush — they profit whether or not you find gold.

# What About Selling on Amazon or Etsy?

Many entrepreneurs turn to established e-commerce platforms like Amazon or Etsy to sell their products. This approach has significant advantages, as these platforms provide access to millions of potential customers who are already in the buying mindset. However, there’s a catch: your product listings often get buried unless you pay for marketing tools to make your products more visible. Even then, success is not guaranteed — it depends entirely on your product and whether it appeals to a niche audience.

If your products sell quickly, these platforms can be incredibly effective. However, for newcomers, it’s often a gamble. You’ll never know for sure whether your product has a ready audience until you start selling.

# What to Expect in 2025?

In 2025, the “shovel sellers” — those who create platforms and tools — will continue to thrive. They profit from the aspirations of entrepreneurs, offering tools and upgrades that promise to improve your chances of success. Unfortunately, many businesses still fail to find their “gold.”

The best advice I can give, based on my experience, is to be cautious with your spending. I’ve purchased ad packages and e-commerce upgrades, but my website only generated five sales. Most people are hesitant to buy from brand-new websites, so it’s often better to focus on building an organic presence. Create a simple launch page with essential information about your product and business. Don’t spend too much time perfecting your website’s design early on.

While e-commerce platforms are useful, avoid over-investing in upgrades and tools. They are designed to encourage you to spend more in hopes of achieving greater sales, but that strategy doesn’t always work. Instead, focus on your product. If you try to force growth too quickly, like injecting chemicals into a tomato to make it grow faster, you may end up with something unnatural and unsustainable.",1,1732905381.0,my1stmillondollar,0,1.0,False

Whether your living room has a modern, rustic, or traditional theme, a brown loveseat can blend seamlessly. Its rich hue adds warmth and depth, enhancing the overall ambiance of your space.

Another great advantage is the comfort a reclining loveseat offers. After a long day, there’s nothing quite like sinking into a comfortable seat that allows you to stretch out and relax. Recliners provide you with the option to adjust your position, helping to ease tension in your back and joints. This is particularly beneficial for those who experience discomfort when sitting for long periods.

Some models even come with built-in cup holders and storage compartments, enhancing your living area’s functionality. This means you can enjoy snacks or drinks without having to get up, adding convenience to your leisure time.

Durability is another critical factor when considering furniture. Many brown reclining loveseats are made from high-quality materials designed to withstand daily use. Look for options with sturdy frames and upholstery that can resist wear and tear. Whether covered in leather or high-quality fabric, a reclining loveseat is typically designed to stand the test of time. Therefore, investing in a well-crafted piece can save you money in the long run by reducing the need for frequent replacements.

1h2sbov,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h2sbov/aita_for_expectingwishing_my_wife_was_more_tidy/,AITA for expecting/wishing my wife was more tidy?,"I get that this topic may appear trivial or even silly to some, but I really cannot cope anymore. I’ve realized I feel so uncomfortable and unhappy in my own dwelling, it’s actually affecting my mental health. I sometimes even fantasize about staying married but somehow having separate houses/apartments. Not an option, obviously.

I (M early 30s) was raised to clean once a week – dusting, vacuuming, bathroom, kitchen, etc. I was taught to participate in helping to clean the house from a young age (7-8 yo). Another expectation was that the place should be kept tidy, on an ongoing basis. That is, everything should have its intentional place, and be put away after use. This part, for me, is not “cleaning” but just the normal part of everyday living. You do it automatically (to me, this doesn’t require effort).

Maybe to some this is clean freak territory, IDK. I’m aware that how you keep a house, and what it means for a place to be clean or tidy, is all very subjective. So, in short, maybe I'm at the asshole for having this standard.

My wife (late 20s) was raised very differently. She never cleaned at home, doesn’t really know how to do it well, and is not really interested. Any sort of cleaning by her is haphazard, spontaneous action, disconnected from any idea of keeping the space clean as a whole. Most importantly for me, however, is that she doesn’t keep the place tidy – she doesn’t put things away. The whole concept of “things have their place” is entirely foreign to her. Honestly, she just cannot wrap her head around it. The idea of putting things away, or as she puts it “having to think of places” for things, is a genuine pain in the ass for her, and something she’s unwilling to engage in. For her, cleaning is when you put things away. And cleaning happens when it happens (not too often, or too regularly).

The net result is that any empty space – shelf, countertop, window sill, coffee table – inevitably becomes covered in stuff over time. Receipts, plates, cups, shipping boxes, clothes, chargers, cosmetics, a kindle, cold meds from 3 months ago, a lighter. You get the idea. At first we got into many arguments/discussions about this. It didn’t do any good, and anyway… who was I to impose my standard onto her? Next stage, I just started cleaning “my way” for the both of us. But that just led to me feeling frustrated for having to pick up after my partner (+was, in a way, controlling behavior anyway), and actually also resulted in some fights because I would unavoidably move some things she didn’t want moved when tidying her items for her. Since we met young (she was still a uni student), I naively thought maybe she will become more tidy once we start “adulting” for real. The opposite happened.

Over the years, I just slowly gave up. I got tired of the arguments… and anyway, even when I cleaned the place, it would return to the “untidy” state within days, sometimes hours. I also do not want to be ""the parent"" in my own relationship, telling/asking my partner to clean up after herself like she's a child.

Because our shared place was (and continues to be) so untidy, I also lost any desire to deep clean the house regularly. Turns out that cleaning the kitchen/bathroom/dusting/vacuuming/etc. is all really annoying when there’s a ton of stuff constantly in your way. Furthermore, what’s the point when the place looks like shit afterwards anyway? Eventually, I even started leaving my own things around randomly… because who cares at this point?

Gradually, we fell into a rhythm of basically doing things her way. One of us cleans something haphazardly when it gets too dirty to ignore… a kitchen sink, shower, or whatever. First thing in the morning, just to make enough counter space in the kitchen for preparing a cup of coffee, I often have to do push some of her stuff out of the way with both hands as I sigh to myself audibly. It’s like something out of a sitcom.

I manage to keep one place in the house tidy and clean, a tiny nook of an office. It’s the only place in the house I don’t feel bad in. If I’m eating alone, I even have my meals there. Everywhere else in the house, I honestly just try not to think about it at this point (I dissociate from it). But it’s still hard, I don’t feel good in my own house, I feel defeated, and I’m embarrassed to have friends and family over.

I could use any advice. Other than this issue, the relationship is solid. This is the one area where we just never found common ground – no matter how many serious talks, heated arguments, even angry fights we had on this subject over the years. We’re at a deadlock. She has her way of being, and I have mine. And I feel like it would be the asshole thing to do to demand her to be someone else at this point. I can’t really expect her to become a different person. Furthermore, I’m well aware that many people live the way she lives (I guess... the way we both live now). For many it’s not a problem to live like this, so maybe I’m the problem?",3,1732904955.0,AITAH,10,0.81,False

I have some very specific questions, that might seem odd to some, but I'm an overthinker and a little weird in general so bear with me. I'm hoping that some of you awesome Redditors can help me answer some, if not all of them.

1. Where can I find the most authentic Tom Yum Gai, a spicy Thai soup with chicken, in central London? Doesn't matter if it's dine in or take out.

2. Does anyone have intel on how the staff at Whiskers cat café treats their cats? How is the animal welfare in general?

3. Where can I get a good frappuccuno in central London or a bit outside, from a smaller business? (Not Starbucks or Costa Coffee)

4. What's the best day and time to go to Covent Garden and Winter Wonderland? I would prefer for it not to be too crowded. One time I went to Tusenfryd in Vinterbro, Norway and that day it seemed like every school in the capital were going to that amusement park. Been there, done that.

5. What's the best way to pay for public transport? Do we get any discount if we pay in advance? Should we get Visitor Oyster cards, or is it not worth it?

6. Is there anything you would like to recommend we check out from 1st to 5th of December?

7. If you live in central London and would like some specific Norwegian food or snacks, I can bring some for you as long as you pay for the products. (I'll have to pick one or two if several people request this.)

Neither of us have ever been to the city so we were looking for recommendations on what parts of town to stay in? Preferably somewhere with decent access to public transportation. 

Also, we’re planning to stay for a week so any recommendations on things to do/see/eat? Between the two of us, we’re into music, anime, museums, gardens, drag shows, arcades, pastries, bubble tea, and coffee just to list a few things. Any help or recommendations would be greatly appreciated! Thanks :) ",2,1732904104.0,chicagogaybros,5,1.0,False
