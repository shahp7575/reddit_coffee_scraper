1p4zk7i,https://v.redd.it/7j4m31oxy23g1,Issue Siemens EQ6 plus s800,"Hi Everyone,

My \~6 year old coffee machine has given up. I’d really like to repair it, but I’m not sure how to fix the issue.

The two videos are already a few months old, but I’d still like to continue working on this. The problem started after I returned from a 1 week vacation, so I initially assumed it was a descaling issue. I’ve tried descaling it several times and managed to get through the cycle, but beyond that I haven’t had any success.

The first video state did return after a few restarts, alternating with the scenario shown in the first video. The first video shows the text: 'Malfunction. Please call the hotline.'. 

Does anyone know what the problem might be, and which parts I should replace?

Thank you in advance!",1,1763935879.0,appliancerepair,0,1.0,False

1p4zjqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1p4zjqt/turns_out_the_spark_in_our_db_was_bigger_than_we/,Turns out the spark in our DB was bigger than we thought… literally,"My wife [43F] and I [43M] have been slowly climbing out of a dead-bedroom rut.
Nothing dramatic—just years of work, responsibilities, ADHD, autoimmune issues, and life draining the spark and leaving almost no room for intimacy.

Then this week we discovered something larger in our relationship—something that’s always been there, we just finally saw it in the right light.
Turns out… it was huge.

We both grew up in an orthodox religious environment and neighborhood—we actually met in kindergarten. In that context, sex was shamed, never talked about, and definitely never celebrated. Add that to today’s porn-era media landscape and “sex sells” culture, and I defaulted to assuming “everyone else is bigger and better than me.” I spent my whole life believing I was nothing special—maybe even below average, especially in the size department under my belt.

But this week I learned I actually am a little special and unique—turns out I’m in the 92nd percentile for penis length. Along with other things I hoped might brighten up our (not totally dark) DB, I always quietly wondered if being bigger would play an out-sized role.

Finding this out didn’t give me unhealthy ego—it gave me a grounded, quiet confidence.
Like: Oh… this thing I’ve always ignored out of shame is actually rare, and it’s fully hers.
Like realizing I’d been holding a rare card this whole time and never played it.

And when that clicked, everything shifted instantly.

I started flirting more, teasing her, touching her, and taking the lead with this calm, playful “Bull” energy. Not aggressive—just sure of myself, more assertive, present, and having fun with it.

And she reacted with this spark of excitement—almost like she suddenly realized:
“Wait… this is actually unique, and it’s mine.”
That excitement, appreciation, and playful pride came through instantly. The energy between us changed fast, and honestly—it was awesome.

Today she asked, “Want to get coffee?”
I said, “Are you asking me on a coffee date? 💦”

Instant spark.

At the coffee shop standing in line to order she was all over me—touching me, brushing against me, holding me, giving me that look. Normally I’d panic in a public setting like this (sweatpants + commando = high-risk situation), but this time? I didn’t shrink.

This tight little coffee shop packed with Angelenos doing their Sunday coffee rituals, we kept flirting. I was getting plump and leaky, she was clearly enjoying it… and when it was our turn to order, I stood up and ordered my Americano without adjusting or hiding anything.

In my mind half the place could see my outline—and instead of embarrassment, it turned me on.
It felt like this sexy secret between us—her knowing exactly what she was doing, me feeling like she was quietly proud of what’s “on tap,” and both of us leaning into the tension that drew us closer.

Leaning into this subtle Bull dynamic has been genuinely exciting and has brought us closer—more flirting, more touching, more playful heat throughout the day. Like we uncovered a part of our relationship that had always been there, just waiting for us to finally see it clearly.

Now we’re leaning into more “Bull themes,” and honestly?
It’s pretty damn cool.

Small win, but a meaningful shift.

At first came denial. I kept all the clothes that didn't fit trying to squeeze my way into them. I refused to buy new clothes for months. At some point I got tired of being uncomfortable all the time, so I gave in. I realized that what I hated seeing in the mirror everyday was not just ""a bad day"" or I wasn't ""just bloated"". It was the real depiction of my flesh, fat and bones.

  
""With all this fat stored in me, I do not need any more food"" I thought. I tried my best to restrict my appetite. I remember going for 36h with no food except water and coffee. Obviously, I felt weak and irritable all the time and this kind of ""diet"" drove me to a habit of binge-eating. I started postponing activities for when I would ""be back"" in my old body. I started counting calories. I started learning about ""good"" and ""bad"" foods.

  
I hate returning to my hometown, I hate people who knew me when I was skinny seeing me now. I keep thinking ""sorry for having to look at me"". I already struggled with self-pity and this has clearly fed my desire to feel sorry for myself.

  
A year has passed and I'm still struggling with these thoughts. Right now, I've stopped being stupid about food. I trust my body and my needs. When it tells me its hungry, I eat. I try my best to eat healthy, go to the gym and have an active life so I can build up my confidence.  
Unfortunately, I am constantly discourage by the lack of change in my body. My mindset has gotten a bit better but I have still yet to accept the situation. The past few weeks, I take down my mirror. I mourn my old body a lot. I miss it.

Some friends and I have been throwing around the idea of renting space somewhere for a Saturday and doing a D&D marathon that is open to the public. We’d charge $5-$10 at the door and people could play as much as they want in a decent space. Along the way, we’d probably have some snacks available for purchase but let people bring their own. Doubtful it would make big money but it’s more in the line of “build the thing you’d like to see” 

That all said, conversation drifted to liability. Everything has liability. If we’re charging admission to an advertised event, even if it is extremely low risk, do we need to seek insurance? Likewise, if we’re selling pre-packaged food and drinks, and maybe making coffee, do we need a permit?

1p4zf84,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1p4zf84/150_hours_update_living_in_barcelona/,150 Hours Update: Living in Barcelona,"I wanted to share an update because my situation is a little unusual. I moved to Barcelona in late August to study for an MBA, and at that point I was still level 2. I just hit level 3, which is far behind my goal as life has been extremely busy, but I remain committed to this journey.

**Background and Daily Reality**

I moved here for an MBA program that is entirely in English. On top of that, I have a wife and a young daughter. Between the workload for school and the responsibilities at home, I have almost no time for CI. I imagined I would spend a lot of my free time listening to Spanish, but most of my time outside of class gets eaten by schoolwork or family needs.

As far as immersion goes, living in Barcelona does not help me much yet. I hear a lot of Spanish around me, especially from the many Latin American students in my program, but I am not at a level where I can follow what they are talking about. Basic interactions with Spaniards are still hard. I can order coffee or get through a checkout line, but when someone asks anything more complicated I usually do not understand them. I wanted to follow a stricter DS approach, but living here forces me to step outside that.

**Expectations vs Reality**

I hoped to be a lot further along by now. I thought Level 4 might be possible before the end of the year. That did not happen. I used to think I might reach Level 6 by the end of 2026, but with my current obligations that also seems unlikely. My pace is simply slower than I thought it would be.

I am trying to stay motivated and not get discouraged. The good news is that I still enjoy the process. I just wish I had two or three hours a day to give to Spanish, but realistically I am lucky if I can manage one.

**What I’m Watching**

Most of my DS videos are now around Level 38. It feels like I have been stuck in the 35 to 40 range forever. I skip the videos that really do not interest me, but I am not very picky. I made it roughly 100 episodes into Cuentame but eventually got bored.

Recently I started the Stardew Valley series from Spanish Boost Gaming. I have been looking forward to “unlocking” his content for a long time because I love video games and SDV in particular. The character dialogue is extremely hard for me, but when he is just talking I can understand most of it. That is motivating and honestly a relief. I hope I am not pushing his content too early, but it keeps me watching.

Since so much DS content relies on visuals, it is harder for me to get hours in while commuting or doing chores. I do listen to DS videos while doing those things, but I know I am acquiring less efficiently when I cannot look at the screen.

**Taking a Spanish Class in January**

Starting in January, I can enroll in a Spanish elective at my school. I believe in the CI method more than traditional instruction, and I would rather spend that classroom time on more CI, but the class is included in my tuition and it counts toward my credits. It feels like something I should take.

I have not taken the placement test yet, but I plan to do it soon. I expect to be placed in beginner level because I have almost no reading, writing, or grammar exposure. I am hoping the listening section will help a bit. I would prefer to be in a class with people who have at least some exposure to Spanish, so that I can be ahead in comprehension while they are ahead in speaking and writing. We will see what happens.

**Final Thoughts**

Progress has been much slower than I imagined, but I am sticking with it. If anyone else has juggled DS while dealing with a tight schedule and a family, I would be interested in hearing how you kept going.",4,1763935535.0,dreamingspanish,0,1.0,False

We got close because we always ended up on the same shift. We’d talk a lot and people even joked that I’m the only one who got him to open up, since tahimik daw siya before. Our team knows I have a crush on him even he knows.

We reached that point where we grab coffee together, he cooks for me or packs me food, and I watch his basketball games. But the problem is… I still don’t know what we are. I assumed things because he really showed things.

He even asks me out for coffee or whatever, but there’s always a joke after — like halatang nagh-hold back. And things only push through because I insist, like, “okay sige ako na ’to.” I checked — he’s not gay or anything lol. He even teases me with other people at work kasi may mga nagpaparamdam sa’kin na hindi ko naman type.

I reciprocated the energy he was giving, but I also didn’t want to look makulit. I used to always start the conversation, but now I only talk to him when he talks to me first 😝.

I started getting confused when he told me he missed me. We didn’t have RTO for two weeks because of the storm, so we were only chatting on Teams. At first I thought he was just joking because banter namin yun like “Miss mo ba ako? Edi hindi.” But this time he suddenly said, “I miss you.”

I took a long time to reply, until nakalog-out na ako. The next day, I opened Teams and he replied, “edi hindi 🤣.” I just said “mis u 2,” and he reacted with “😮”. I don’t think he’s giving mixed signals — it honestly feels like we’re both just waiting for each other to reach out first lol.

But lately I’m confused as fuck. I want to ask him what we are, but I don’t have the courage. I’m scared he’ll reject me or question why I assumed those things — like “ganda-gandahan lang?” And I don’t want things to get awkward at work because he’s the only person I’m close to in the team.

At the same time, it’s draining to overthink all of this.

1. The kitchen island does not have an overhang, so my initial plan of barstools didn't work and we bought this round kitchen table and ikea chairs secondhand.

#2: Killing a man and litterally cutting his heart out of his body inside a telephone booth would not only leave the entire booth covered in blood, make it impossible to hide the evidence, but it would also cover her in blood. (Plus it is the middle of the day) Chances of sneaking out of the country drop to absolutely zero. When she ""reached for the knife"" that was to defend herself in case he was going to attack her. Obviously assassin training to be ready if something seems off.

#3: She already knew about makima and that she was incredibly powerful (she states running away was pointless when she finds out makima owned denji). She knew even she did not stand a chance at escaping from her. Thus she would not want to draw the attention of devil hunters unnecessarily.

#4: SHE IS AN ASSASSIN. It makes zero sense that she would fall for some kid after seeing him once. She is like 20. She has probably seduced targets many times before as she clearly is good at it. 
She obviously knew he was going to enter the phone booth, and intended to get him interested in her so she could invite him to the coffee shop.

#5: Her aim from the very beginning was getting him alone at the school. Obviously this was the plan because she didn't actually go to the school lmao, so this wasn't actually spontaneous. It was the plan, everything before this was 100% fake.

THIS is where reze began to fall for denji as they talked about their lives and she realized he was similar to her. The conversation got too hot for Denji's head so she went to the pool lol. That scene ensues. At the end of the pool scene, that is where she realizes he represents hope for her. Hope she has litterally never had her entire life. ""Let me teach you everything."" (My favorite line)

So she decides to take that chance at escaping her life. (Yes some of it was probably liking denji. But remember she is a SEVERELY traumatized and probably tortured girl. Her main motivation is to escape her life with a beacon of hope that is denji.)

Then of course the rest ensues, she realizes he doesn't want to run, hope is gone, so then she kills him. Feels sorry about it, but kills him and completes the mission, before being foiled by beam (the goat).





TLDR:

Saying that she was planning to kill him in the phone booth and fell in love instead is essentially describing her character as incompetent and a damsel who falls in love with the hero instead of being the amazing and beautifully complex character she really is.",3,1763935146.0,Chainsawfolk,2,0.8,False

We are a couple in our mid-40’s who currently live in Seattle. We are headed to SD in early December to check out potential neighborhoods ahead of a possible move in early 2026.

We’re looking to rent a house or townhouse with garage parking. One of us will be commuting to Rancho Bernardo, so that is a consideration.

We live in a residential neighborhood in Seattle where we have some things that are walkable (coffee, brewery, bakery, etc). I realize that unless we are in a very small number of neighborhoods in SD that may not be likely.

We enjoy cool neighborhood restaurants, cocktail bars, neighborhood coffee shops and bakeries, love Balboa Park, I very much dig the vibe in OB and love the beach there, but again probably not likely that we’ll find a rental there within our price range (and I think the commute could be tricky).

Some neighborhoods that have been suggested to us:

-Maybe North Park, but again likely too pricey and older housing stock
-Crown Point (probably too pricey)
-Bay Park
-Bay Ho
-Serra Mesa
-Kensington
-Clairemont 

We’ve briefly explored:
-OB
-PB (enough to know it’s not for me)
-North Park
-A bit of South Park
-Hillcrest 
-Point Loma
-Briefly stopped in La Jolla and some of the beach towns in North County.

My name is Donavin Meeks. I’m 22 years old, and last month, I found a VHS tape. 

I had been rummaging through my attic, searching for some old Halloween costumes I could pull back out for old times' sake, just to get into the ol’ holiday spirit. 

I’ll preface by saying, much like many others, my attic was almost backroom-ish. 

The way the dust had collected amongst the clutter, and how the cobwebs seemed to decorate the beams that supported my roof, the atmosphere alone was unsettling enough. 

As I searched through box after box of old knick-knacks, photo albums, and stocking stuffers that nobody used anymore, I finally managed to find the cardboard box labeled “Halloween” with a little cutely drawn spider with a smiley face beside it. 

All hail the Gods of irony, because as soon as I lifted the box, the biggest black widow I’d ever seen came running out, its legs clicking against the hardwood.

I *hate* spiders, so this obviously caused me to jump backwards, tripping and falling over some other boxes and immediately flailing like a maniac in fear of a bite from the arachnid. 

Hopping to my feet and checking ferociously for any sign of the thing on any part of my body, I happened to glance down at the mess of boxes I had just created. 

Lying in the center of the scattered clothing and Christmas decorations, lie a VHS tape. 

Unlike the other items, the VHS tape was completely dust free, and seemed as though it had been watched to about the halfway point. 

I picked it up to analyze it and found that it had been labeled “Do Not Watch” in black permanent marker over white painters tape. 

Staring at the words, I couldn’t help but feel utter intrigue. 

Not only had I never seen the tape, I had never even OWNED a VHS player. 

I mean, I’m 22, honestly, what am I going to use one of those things for? 

The dams of curiosity broke within the first two minutes of my discovery, and off I went, down to the local pawn shop to find my VHS player. 

It cost me a solid $5.98. One of the perks of being obsolete, I guess. 
Upon returning home, I was bewildered to find that the mysterious videotape was no longer on the coffee table where I had left it. 

Living alone, this turned out to be incredibly concerning to me. 

I began to rack my brain, thinking of how I could have misplaced the thing. 

I distinctly remembered placing it directly in the center of my coffee table. I mean, I checked under the couches, on the dining room table, my bedroom, bathroom, every room in my house had been checked. 

I began thinking that it was my mind that had been lost instead of that damn tape. 

I stayed up into the early morning hours because the idea of something that distinct just vanishing like that; it irked me. 

My mind already tends to wander and teeter on borderline paranoid schizophrenia, and this event did NOT help. 

Once I finally DID choose to go to bed, my sleep was shakey at best. 

I couldn’t have been asleep for more than an hour and a half when the abrupt sounds of what seemed to be footsteps awoke me. 

I could have swore that I heard the sound coming from directly above me, yet, once I fully regained consciousness, they had stopped completely. 

I had first put it off as a dream, a mere trick of the mind, similar that feeling you get when you’re falling in your sleep. 

That thought gave me comfort, and allowed me to doze back into sleep. However, that comfort was quickly vanquished when the same sounds started up yet again. 

This time I KNEW what I had heard, and I wasn’t about to just lay in bed defenseless. 

I immediately threw the covers off of myself and grabbed the bat that I keep beside my bed in case of home intruders just like this one. 

Being sure to make a lot of noise so the intruder KNEW that I was coming. I wanted them afraid, I wanted them to feel what I had been feeling. 

I yanked the attic door down and began climbing the ladder, flashlight in one hand, bat in the other. 

I hyped myself up as I ascended, preparing myself for whatever may lay within the plane of darkness which is my attic. 

Once I got about 6 inches from the entrance, I called out. 

“I know you’re up there! I hope you know I’m calling the cops, AND I’m armed. So just come on out please. Don’t make this any harder than it needs to be.” 

I waited a few moments and received no response. 

The silence was daunting, and cut through me.

The hot attic air seemed to grow chilled. A distinct drop in temperature that made me shiver. 

“Just come on out, man. We can work this out just as soon as you come out and make yourself known!” 

I waited a few moments once more, and once more, received no response. 

“Alright, I’m coming up! I swear to God if I see any movement whatsoever from you, I am bashing your head in!” 

I slowly began to ascend what remained of the ladder. 

My right palm sweat profusely wrapped around the rubber grip of the bat, whereas my left hand shook the beam of the flashlight ever so slightly. 

I began to scan the room with the beam, making sure light touched every surface possible from the attic entrance. 

Everything seemed still. Calm. Untouched, if it weren’t for where the few boxes I had knocked over prior. 

Though my light landed on no one, it did happen to fall upon a familiar plastic black rectangle, placed right back in the center of the spilled clutter. 

“No fucking way…” I thought to myself. 

Cautiously, I made my way towards the VHS tape, practically spinning in circles with my flashlight as I inched closer. 

Still, no sign of an intruder. 

I reached down and retrieved the VHS tape. 

Just then, a whole wall of boxes came tumbling over from across the attic, followed by the sounds of swift footsteps that seemed to approach me at an inhuman pace, only to completely dissipate as soon as it was before me. 

The flashlight and bat were both shaking wildly now as I spun around the room, sweating and petrified. 

“COME OUT! COME OUT RIGHT NOW!” I screamed. 

The attic was now eerily silent again. 

As I stood there, shaking and on the brink of a panic attack, the sound of creaking floorboards scratched the back of my mind, and a deep, booming voice spoke from behind me. 

“Boo.” 

I flew across the attic at a speed I didn’t know I was possible of achieving, 

I was down the ladder so fast that my foot ended up getting caught on the last rung, causing my ankle to twist, followed by a sickening POP that shot pain throughout my entire leg. 

I had saved my videotape though, and this time, it wasn’t leaving my side. 

I ended up having to spend the rest of the night and next morning in the hospital getting x-rayed and having my foot casted up. 

I had ended up breaking my ankle, and all I could tell the doctors was I tripped while climbing out of the attic. 

Anyway, I returned home as soon as I was cleared, anxious to finally watch this VHS that seemed to had randomly appeared in my home, as well as some sort of unwanted visitor. 

I never really fed into the whole paranormal thing, but holy shit, man. The true horror that I felt in that moment up in that attic; it made me a believer instantly. 

Well, I should say that it made me believe that things can be ATTACHED to objects. Whether it be holy or demonic. Attachments can happen. 

And I believe that’s what the case was with this tape. 

Once I arrived home, I was determined to finally view its contents.  

Something that I had failed to notice upon retrieving the tape from the attic was that now, instead of being half way through, it was completely rewound to the very beginning. 

Not only that, but the black marker had now been turned…red? It looked as though a completely new label had been placed on the tape. It looked…flashier. Like the *CAUTION* tag on a bottle of chemicals. 

“DO. NOT. WATCH. THIS.” 

Yeah, right. Who WOULD’NT watch this? 

Arriving home, I found that my house had been completely trashed. 

Cabinets were thrown open, couch cushions ripped off and strewn across the floor, pots and pans sat neatly across every counter top. 

Luckily for me, my VHS player had remained untouched, and sat where it had been just below the TV stand. 

Unbothered by the mess, unbothered by the clear red flags, I sat down in front of my television and popped the tape into the player. 

Nothing happened at first. Just a black screen that lingered. 

Suddenly, blasting white and black static came scratching across the display. 

I jumped a bit, and felt my heart drop before steadying. 

Slowly but surely, the picture began to become clear and smooth. 

The first thing to come into view was a mailbox. 

A mailbox that stood displaying my exact address. 

My heart began to speed up again. 

As the picture video became clearer, I was able to make out the sidewalk that led to my front porch. 

Then my front door. 

Then my stairs.

The attic door. 

The ladder. 

And then darkness as the person recording nestled into a dark corner within the attic. 

The video then remained that way. Black stillness for an uncomfortably long period of time. 

There was a sudden and harsh skip in the frames and now the camera was panned to the attic door from within the attic. 

Distinct shadows could be seen through the cracks in the doorframe, shadows that seemed to be that of a certain 22 year old man, living alone. 

There was another cut, and now the recorder appeared to be crouched in a new corner of the attic, filming as the door to the fell open and footsteps began to climb the ladder. 

I watched in horror as my own head popped into frame, waddling up the stairs, completely oblivious, as I searched through box after box for a stupid Halloween costume. 

The video then abruptly ended, right before the black widow came crawling out from under the package causing me to jump backwards and fall. 

The next cut was a shot of my living room. It showed the camera slowly approaching the tape that lay on my coffee table. 

Another sudden cut. 

A hand was now in frame, pale and decrepit. It carefully placed my silver spaghetti pot atop the kitchen counter before patting it softly, then panning the camera around the room to reveal the mess that had been created. 

The next and final cut revealed me, yet again, cautiously searching the addict with a flashlight. Eyes wide and apprehension painted clearly across my face. 


I stared at the television in absolute dismay. Frozen. My jaw dropped cleanly to the floor. 

I remained in a trance-like state for the remainder of the footage, broken only when the video abruptly ended, and was somehow replaced by live footage. 

Live footage that showed a 22 year old man, who lives alone, sitting in awe, as he watched himself on the television. 

My mind took longer than I care to admit for it to put the pieces together, but once it did, it was too late, and the sound of heavy footsteps began echoing from the television, and the live footage inched closer and closer to my spot on the sofa. ",1,1763934723.0,SpinalTapHorror,0,1.0,False

My name is Donavin Meeks. I’m 22 years old, and last month, I found a VHS tape. 

I had been rummaging through my attic, searching for some old Halloween costumes I could pull back out for old times' sake, just to get into the ol’ holiday spirit. 

I’ll preface by saying, much like many others, my attic was almost backroom-ish. 

The way the dust had collected amongst the clutter, and how the cobwebs seemed to decorate the beams that supported my roof, the atmosphere alone was unsettling enough. 

As I searched through box after box of old knick-knacks, photo albums, and stocking stuffers that nobody used anymore, I finally managed to find the cardboard box labeled “Halloween” with a little cutely drawn spider with a smiley face beside it. 

All hail the Gods of irony, because as soon as I lifted the box, the biggest black widow I’d ever seen came running out, its legs clicking against the hardwood.

I *hate* spiders, so this obviously caused me to jump backwards, tripping and falling over some other boxes and immediately flailing like a maniac in fear of a bite from the arachnid. 

Hopping to my feet and checking ferociously for any sign of the thing on any part of my body, I happened to glance down at the mess of boxes I had just created. 

Lying in the center of the scattered clothing and Christmas decorations, lie a VHS tape. 

Unlike the other items, the VHS tape was completely dust free, and seemed as though it had been watched to about the halfway point. 

I picked it up to analyze it and found that it had been labeled “Do Not Watch” in black permanent marker over white painters tape. 

Staring at the words, I couldn’t help but feel utter intrigue. 

Not only had I never seen the tape, I had never even OWNED a VHS player. 

I mean, I’m 22, honestly, what am I going to use one of those things for? 

The dams of curiosity broke within the first two minutes of my discovery, and off I went, down to the local pawn shop to find my VHS player. 

It cost me a solid $5.98. One of the perks of being obsolete, I guess. 
Upon returning home, I was bewildered to find that the mysterious videotape was no longer on the coffee table where I had left it. 

Living alone, this turned out to be incredibly concerning to me. 

I began to rack my brain, thinking of how I could have misplaced the thing. 

I distinctly remembered placing it directly in the center of my coffee table. I mean, I checked under the couches, on the dining room table, my bedroom, bathroom, every room in my house had been checked. 

I began thinking that it was my mind that had been lost instead of that damn tape.

I *hate* spiders, so this obviously caused me to jump backwards, tripping and falling over some other boxes and immediately flailing like a maniac in fear of a bite from the arachnid. 

Hopping to my feet and checking ferociously for any sign of the thing on any part of my body, I happened to glance down at the mess of boxes I had just created. 

Lying in the center of the scattered clothing and Christmas decorations, lie a VHS tape. 

Unlike the other items, the VHS tape was completely dust free, and seemed as though it had been watched to about the halfway point. 

I picked it up to analyze it and found that it had been labeled “Do Not Watch” in black permanent marker over white painters tape. 

Staring at the words, I couldn’t help but feel utter intrigue. 

Not only had I never seen the tape, I had never even OWNED a VHS player. 

I mean, I’m 22, honestly, what am I going to use one of those things for? 

The dams of curiosity broke within the first two minutes of my discovery, and off I went, down to the local pawn shop to find my VHS player. 

It cost me a solid $5.98. One of the perks of being obsolete, I guess. 
Upon returning home, I was bewildered to find that the mysterious videotape was no longer on the coffee table where I had left it. 

Living alone, this turned out to be incredibly concerning to me. 

I began to rack my brain, thinking of how I could have misplaced the thing. 

I distinctly remembered placing it directly in the center of my coffee table. I mean, I checked under the couches, on the dining room table, my bedroom, bathroom, every room in my house had been checked. 

I began thinking that it was my mind that had been lost instead of that damn tape. 

I stayed up into the early morning hours because the idea of something that distinct just vanishing like that; it irked me. 

My mind already tends to wander and teeter on borderline paranoid schizophrenia, and this event did NOT help. 

Once I finally DID choose to go to bed, my sleep was shakey at best. 

I couldn’t have been asleep for more than an hour and a half when the abrupt sounds of what seemed to be footsteps awoke me. 

I could have swore that I heard the sound coming from directly above me, yet, once I fully regained consciousness, they had stopped completely. 

I had first put it off as a dream, a mere trick of the mind, similar that feeling you get when you’re falling in your sleep. 

That thought gave me comfort, and allowed me to doze back into sleep. However, that comfort was quickly vanquished when the same sounds started up yet again. 

This time I KNEW what I had heard, and I wasn’t about to just lay in bed defenseless. 

I immediately threw the covers off of myself and grabbed the bat that I keep beside my bed in case of home intruders just like this one. 

Being sure to make a lot of noise so the intruder KNEW that I was coming. I wanted them afraid, I wanted them to feel what I had been feeling. 

I yanked the attic door down and began climbing the ladder, flashlight in one hand, bat in the other. 

I hyped myself up as I ascended, preparing myself for whatever may lay within the plane of darkness which is my attic. 

Once I got about 6 inches from the entrance, I called out. 

“I know you’re up there! I hope you know I’m calling the cops, AND I’m armed. So just come on out please. Don’t make this any harder than it needs to be.” 

I waited a few moments and received no response. 

The silence was daunting, and cut through me.

The hot attic air seemed to grow chilled. A distinct drop in temperature that made me shiver. 

“Just come on out, man. We can work this out just as soon as you come out and make yourself known!” 

I waited a few moments once more, and once more, received no response. 

“Alright, I’m coming up! I swear to God if I see any movement whatsoever from you, I am bashing your head in!” 

I slowly began to ascend what remained of the ladder. 

My right palm sweat profusely wrapped around the rubber grip of the bat, whereas my left hand shook the beam of the flashlight ever so slightly. 

I began to scan the room with the beam, making sure light touched every surface possible from the attic entrance. 

Everything seemed still. Calm. Untouched, if it weren’t for where the few boxes I had knocked over prior. 

Though my light landed on no one, it did happen to fall upon a familiar plastic black rectangle, placed right back in the center of the spilled clutter. 

“No fucking way…” I thought to myself. 

Cautiously, I made my way towards the VHS tape, practically spinning in circles with my flashlight as I inched closer. 

Still, no sign of an intruder. 

I reached down and retrieved the VHS tape. 

Just then, a whole wall of boxes came tumbling over from across the attic, followed by the sounds of swift footsteps that seemed to approach me at an inhuman pace, only to completely dissipate as soon as it was before me. 

The flashlight and bat were both shaking wildly now as I spun around the room, sweating and petrified. 

“COME OUT! COME OUT RIGHT NOW!” I screamed. 

The attic was now eerily silent again. 

As I stood there, shaking and on the brink of a panic attack, the sound of creaking floorboards scratched the back of my mind, and a deep, booming voice spoke from behind me. 

“Boo.” 

I flew across the attic at a speed I didn’t know I was possible of achieving, 

I was down the ladder so fast that my foot ended up getting caught on the last rung, causing my ankle to twist, followed by a sickening POP that shot pain throughout my entire leg. 

I had saved my videotape though, and this time, it wasn’t leaving my side. 

I ended up having to spend the rest of the night and next morning in the hospital getting x-rayed and having my foot casted up. 

I had ended up breaking my ankle, and all I could tell the doctors was I tripped while climbing out of the attic. 

Anyway, I returned home as soon as I was cleared, anxious to finally watch this VHS that seemed to had randomly appeared in my home, as well as some sort of unwanted visitor. 

I never really fed into the whole paranormal thing, but holy shit, man. The true horror that I felt in that moment up in that attic; it made me a believer instantly. 

Well, I should say that it made me believe that things can be ATTACHED to objects. Whether it be holy or demonic. Attachments can happen. 

And I believe that’s what the case was with this tape. 

Once I arrived home, I was determined to finally view its contents.  

Something that I had failed to notice upon retrieving the tape from the attic was that now, instead of being half way through, it was completely rewound to the very beginning. 

Not only that, but the black marker had now been turned…red? It looked as though a completely new label had been placed on the tape. It looked…flashier. Like the *CAUTION* tag on a bottle of chemicals. 

“DO. NOT. WATCH. THIS.” 

Yeah, right. Who WOULD’NT watch this? 

Arriving home, I found that my house had been completely trashed. 

Cabinets were thrown open, couch cushions ripped off and strewn across the floor, pots and pans sat neatly across every counter top. 

Luckily for me, my VHS player had remained untouched, and sat where it had been just below the TV stand. 

Unbothered by the mess, unbothered by the clear red flags, I sat down in front of my television and popped the tape into the player. 

Nothing happened at first. Just a black screen that lingered. 

Suddenly, blasting white and black static came scratching across the display. 

I jumped a bit, and felt my heart drop before steadying. 

Slowly but surely, the picture began to become clear and smooth. 

The first thing to come into view was a mailbox. 

A mailbox that stood displaying my exact address. 

My heart began to speed up again. 

As the picture video became clearer, I was able to make out the sidewalk that led to my front porch. 

Then my front door. 

Then my stairs.

The attic door. 

The ladder. 

And then darkness as the person recording nestled into a dark corner within the attic. 

The video then remained that way. Black stillness for an uncomfortably long period of time. 

There was a sudden and harsh skip in the frames and now the camera was panned to the attic door from within the attic. 

Distinct shadows could be seen through the cracks in the doorframe, shadows that seemed to be that of a certain 22 year old man, living alone. 

There was another cut, and now the recorder appeared to be crouched in a new corner of the attic, filming as the door to the fell open and footsteps began to climb the ladder. 

I watched in horror as my own head popped into frame, waddling up the stairs, completely oblivious, as I searched through box after box for a stupid Halloween costume. 

The video then abruptly ended, right before the black widow came crawling out from under the package causing me to jump backwards and fall. 

The next cut was a shot of my living room. It showed the camera slowly approaching the tape that lay on my coffee table. 

Another sudden cut. 

A hand was now in frame, pale and decrepit. It carefully placed my silver spaghetti pot atop the kitchen counter before patting it softly, then panning the camera around the room to reveal the mess that had been created. 

The next and final cut revealed me, yet again, cautiously searching the addict with a flashlight. Eyes wide and apprehension painted clearly across my face. 


I stared at the television in absolute dismay. Frozen. My jaw dropped cleanly to the floor. 

I remained in a trance-like state for the remainder of the footage, broken only when the video abruptly ended, and was somehow replaced by live footage. 

Live footage that showed a 22 year old man, who lives alone, sitting in awe, as he watched himself on the television. 

My mind took longer than I care to admit for it to put the pieces together, but once it did, it was too late, and the sound of heavy footsteps began echoing from the television, and the live footage inched closer and closer to my spot on the sofa. ",1,1763934669.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

One summer weekend, the Carlsons' decided to go to a bed and breakfast out in the country. Mr. Carlson hadn't had a day off of work in over four months and Mrs. Carlson thought it would be nice to get her daughter out of the city for a little while, rather than leave her with a sitter. So, Mr. Carlson, Mrs. Carlson, and their daughter Janean packed up the car and drove out of the city, along interstate, full of speeding cars and toll booths.  

The further they got away from the city, the more excited Jenean became.  You see, eight year old Jenean had never seen a live cow or horse before. She'd lived in the city for her whole life. The amount of trees and blue sky amazed her. She'd never seen so much space. The city had always been tightly packed and full of people and hot dog venders that smelt like stale cheese and old socks. Leaving the city was the most fun she'd had in a while.  

Mrs. Carlson, herself was excited for her daughter to get out of the city with its lights and noise. She imagined the little girl would want to go hiking and swimming. In fact, just the week before, the family had become so lucky for Mrs. Carlson to find an ad for just the right bed and breakfast in the newspaper.  It had a lake and a forest just near it. There would be hiking experts and free breakfast every morning. Mrs. Carlson was excited. Mr. Carlson just smiled a quiet grin as he drove the car further and further out of town.  

Upon reaching the bed and breakfast, Jenean was so excited, she jumped out of the car as soon as it was parked, ran up to the front porch and stopped just before the stairs. It was an old Victorian home; the oldest she'd ever seen. It had a small turret and a huge wrap around porch. The paint was peeling and a few of the shutters seemed to be on rickety hinges.  

""Oh!"" cried Mrs. Carlson. ""Isn't it darling?!""  ""It could use a bit of paint,"" said Mr. Carlson. 

""Oh, hush,"" Mrs. Carlson, said, lightly smacking her husband's forearm. ""It's lovely."" 

Jenean shifted from side to side, unsure of the house. It seemed odd to her. Something about it scared her, as if a monster was inside, waiting to eat her up. She did not want to go in there.  ""Come along!"" cried her mother as she helped Mr. Carlson drag the bags out of the trunk. ""Our host must be wondering where we are."" 

""Mommy,"" said Jenean, her voice wavering. ""I don't want to go in there. Can we go home?"" 

""But, why, dear? It's such a lovely place and we've only just got here.""  

""It scares me,"" she said, inching back to the car. Jenean's father shook his head and chuckled.  

""She's just afraid of the big, old house. She's never seen one like it."" 

""I am not!"" she cried. ""There's a monster in there and I don't want it to eat me!"" 

""Dear,"" said her mother, reproachfully. ""It's just a house. There is no monster in there. Remember what daddy and I told you?"" Jenean, nodded. ""There are only monsters in movies and T.V. Monsters are make-up and special effects made to scare people. They aren't real."" 

""That's right."" Said her father. ""Now, let's go in and see what's cooking."" He put his nose up to the air. ""It smells delicious."" Comforted by her parents' words, Jenean lifted her nose to the air, too. She smelt chicken, corn, potatoes, and cookies. Cookies?! She thought. Jenean became excited again. She always loved cookies, especially the sugar kind with sprinkles on top. Following her parents into the house, Jenean forgot all about her fears as a plump, elderly woman welcomed them into the ancient foyer.   She wore a flower print dress and a white apron. Holding a tray of wonderfully smelling baked goods, the old woman shouted, joyfully. 

""Oh, Henry! They're here! The Carlson's have arrived."" ""How did you know we were the Carlsons?"" Asked Jenean's father.  

""Well, dear,"" said the warm, welcoming woman. ""You're the only family to stay here this weekend. Lucky for your young daughter here,"" she said, turning to smile at Jenean. ""My granddaughter is here this weekend as well. I'm sure they'll get along fine. I'm Mrs. Harcourt and my husband is Mr. Harcourt. I'm glad you're here this weekend. I was afraid Emily would have no one to play with, the poor dear."" 

The old woman chattered on and on as Jenean's parents followed her into the kitchen and up the stairs to check in. Jenean didn't care about any of this.  She wandered the downstairs until she came upon a fancy parlor full of old furniture and toys. In the center of the piles of old dolls and trains was a young girl with inky black hair and a pale complexion. Her complexion was so pale, she made Jenean's dark skin seem even darker. A small table was filled with a white tea service and tiny spoons and forks. Jenean put her hands behind her back and rocked on her feet. 

""Can I play?"" she asked, quietly.  The little girl named Emily, looked up from her game, surveyed her blue jeans and messy hair for a moment, nodded, and smiled.  

""Ok! But, first; you must be introduced properly."" Jenean wasn't sure what that meant, so she stood where she was, to see what the little girl was to do next. ""Now, bow!"" 

""What?"" Asked Jenean, perplexed.  

""Bow; to the dolls. Everyone has to do it. It's the rules."" ""Oh. Ok."" Jenean gave a low bow and looked up. 

""Now, what?"" 

""Now, you say, dear dolls of grandma's house! I give my love to thee."" 

""Umm..."" Jenean wasn't sure of what that meant, but she didn't want to anger the other little girl and spend the weekend all alone with just her parents. ""Dear dolls of grandma's house, I give my love to thee."" Emily clapped her hands together and gave a happy cry.  

""Now, you can play with us!"" Jenean smiled and sat down amongst the ragged dolls and bears. A few of them had their button eyes falling off and stuffing coming out of all sorts of odd places.  

""Some of your toys seem very old. Doesn't your grandma ever buy you new ones?"" 

""Oh, of course!"" Emily cried. ""It's my birthday, soon. I can't wait.""  

""So, why don't you get rid of the old toys?"" 

""But, I never get rid of my old toys!"" Little Emily seemed shocked at the idea. ""They don't like it."" Her gaze drifted along towards the ragged dolls, old trains, and other toys all around her. Jenean shrugged and remembered her parents telling her that some little girls imagined their toys were real people and that it was a phase they would soon grow out of. Jenean hoped she'd never enter that phase. It seemed ridiculous to her.  It wasn't long after she'd entered the tea party that her parents and Emily's grandma entered the parlor. 

""There you are!"" Cried Jenean's mom. 

""It's dinner time."" 

""And I have sugar cookies with sprinkles on top!"" Cried Mrs. Harcourt. The two girls gave a cry of joy, shoved past Jenean's father and rushed into the dining room where Mr. Harcourt was reading the newspaper. 

""Frank!"" Said Mrs. Harcourt.  ""What have I told you about reading the paper at the dining table? It's rude. "" 

""Oh, calm yourself. I'm sure our guests don't mind, do you?"" Mr. Harcourt gave a teasing grin as everyone sat to eat.  

""We don't mind, do we, Cheryl."" Said Mr. Carlson. 

""Not at all."" She replied. ""You were so kind to let us stay here and only on a week's notice. Never mind us."" Mr. Harcourt gave a satisfied smile as Mrs. Harcourt gave a grumpy grunt and began to spoon the food out onto everyone's plates. It didn't take long for her to begin smiling and chattering on again, as usual. Her and Jenean's parents gabbed on and on as Emily and Jenean tried to see who could eat the largest mashed potato mountain.  

After dinner, everyone settled into the parlor as Emily took her toys up to the attic, to make room for everyone. Jenean helped, paying attention to how carefully she treated the toys. No doubt because they were so old. As they were putting the play things in the attic, Jenean noticed a box way in the back. It was nestled against the walls, just under the eaves of the house. It was a curious thing, wooden and decorated with red and black zig zags, around the borders of the box.   

Jenean drifted closer to the box, the floorboards creaking under her feet. She could see faint outlines of people who looked like they were dressed in white sheets all over their bodies. The women all had curly hair and the men wore beards. Jenean twisted the box around to see the pictures that adorned it. One man wore wings on his ankles.  

His hands were positioned in a way that the latch on the right side of the box seemed to be handed to her by him. There was another man of the left of the box, throwing lightning at the earth and a woman was singing flowers and grapevines out of the ground. On one side, was a man feeding a woman seeds from an oddly shaped fruit as she smiled up at him. On the top of the box was a large star.  Jenean was just about to open the box, to see what was inside when Emily came running over. She grabbed Jenean by the arm and dragged her away.  

""Get away from there!"" She cried, dragging her towards the side of the attic that was more lit and held the masses of smiling dolls and faded, colored toy horses, and doll houses. Emily's eyes were full of terror as she held her away from the dark part of the attic play room. 

""We do not touch the box. It has evil monsters inside of it. If you open it, you will die!"" 

Jenean shook her head. ""Mommy and Daddy say that monsters are only in movies and not something to worry about at all."" Jenean crossed her arms in defiance; intent on finding out what was in that box that frightened Emily so badly. 

""And if it's so scary, why do you keep in in the attic?""  Emily took a step back. 

""I don't like to touch it. I'm afraid the bad thing will get me. I've seen it. It tries to eat people up. I don't like it. C'mon."" Emily said, grabbing Jenean. ""Let's go downstairs. Grandma has cookies and she promised a bed time story."" Jenean pulled away, hands on her hips.  

""Please,"" Emily begged. ""Forget about the box. Please. We can play with other toys. I have other boxes that are much prettier."" Jenean frowned, but after a moment's thought, relented. 

""Ok. Show me your other boxes."" Emily grabbed up and blue box, covered in violets and a small rag doll with black, button eyes.  

Their feet pounded against the old stairs as the two girls made their way to the parlor. They munched on cookies and hot chocolate as Mrs. Harcourt told them faerie tales while knitting. Jenean's mom read a book and Mr. Harcourt was in a quiet conversation with Mr. Carlson on boat repair.  

Jenean and Emily busied themselves with the box of colored plastic jewels, tiny figurines, pieces of stained glass, and little things Emily found while playing in the forest. It wasn't too long before Jenean's curiosity about the strange little box in the attic came back to her. She couldn't seem to get away from it. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't get the box off of her mind. She just wanted to look inside it, imaginary monster or no. Finally, she brought up the courage to ask Emily a question about the box, hoping she wouldn't make the young girl angry.  

""Emily,"" Jenean said, carefully.  

""What?"" she asked, almost as if she knew what was coming. 

""Where did you get the box?"" Emily didn't need to ask which box Jenean was referring to.  

""Grandma found it in a flea market a long time ago. She loves to buy old things from those things all the time. It was in a box of old tea sets and china. She gave it to me as a present."" Emily's face gave the expression of disgust.  

""Oh."" Jenean said no more about the subject and continued to sip her hot chocolate. They both sat back and listened to the velvet voice of Mrs. Harcourt and the clacking of her knitting needles. Soon, the fire began to die and the only people left in the room were Mrs. Carlson, Mr. Harcourt, and the two girls. The old man had fallen asleep in his chair and Mrs. Carlson, looked up from her book at the two girls, sleepily chatting on the Oriental rug. The two had become fast friends over the course of the night and were talking about what they would do if they had a unicorn.  

""Well, girls,"" said Mrs. Carlson, standing up from the sofa. Mr. Harcourt gave a snort and sat up with a start. The two girls giggled, rolling on the floor at his sudden reaction. Mrs. Carlson gave a small laugh and picked up Jenean from the floor.  ""I think it's time for us all to go to bed. Particularly, you two."" Mr. Harcourt stood and stretched.  

""A good idea,"" Mr. Harcourt yawned. He picked up Emily, leaving her box and its contents strewn out on the parlor floor. ""I'd say it's time for us all to tuck in."" He tapped his granddaughter on the nose and carried her upstairs, alongside Mrs. Carlson.  

""I don't want to go to bed,"" Jenean whined. ""Emily and I haven't decided where we were going to take our unicorn on vacation.""   


""Yea,"" said Emily, mid yawn. Mrs. Carlson rolled her eyes.  ""You can decide that tomorrow. You have a whole weekend to play and talk, but for now, you need to go to bed,"" she ordered, facing Jenean. The look on her face told Jenean not to protest anymore, lest she get into trouble.  

The two adults bid each other goodnight, while the girls made promises to make decisions about their hypothetical unicorn in the morning. Then, they all went to bed in their respective rooms.  Throughout the night, Jenean tossed and turned in her little trundle bed, her dreams full of terrorizing dark shapes and gaping mouths, filled with shiny, sharp teeth, colored like red and black zig zags. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next morning, the sun drifted in, lazily through the floral curtains of their room, awakening Jenean to the smell of pancakes and eggs. She still had an unsettling feeling in her stomach as she crossed the room to the bathroom, to find her father brushing his teeth and her mom talking to him over her cup of coffee.  ""Mommy, Daddy."" She said, rubbing her eyes.  

""Good morning,"" said her mother.  

""Mommy, I had a bad dream."" Jenean's father spit out his tooth paste, rinsed his mouth, and kneeled down next to her.  

""What was it?"" he asked, attentively. Mrs. Carlson looked concerned. She didn't want her daughter to begin having bad dreams, not wanting to stay for the weekend. She had made a friend and everything. Mrs. Carlson had been hoping that her and Mr. Carlson could spend the afternoon alone, together.  Jenean frowned and looked at her parents. She seemed hesitant to tell them, but was too scared not to say anything. 

""I saw a monster in my dreams last night and I think it wants to eat me."" She jumped into her explanation. ""Emily has this weird, old box upstairs and she told me there were monsters inside it and if I opened it, they would all eat me up, just like it does everyone else that opens it. Can't we make her get rid of it?"" Both her parents shook their heads.  

""Honey, it's not our box. No we can't. It's probably an old antique and I'm sure Mrs. Harcourt wants to keep it, whatever it is. If it scares you so much, just don't go near it."" Mr. Carlson replied. ""I'm sure there's no monster at all. I bet it couldn't even fit."" 

""Well,"" said Jenean, scratching her head. ""No. It's a small box; not really big. I guess not."" 

Mr. Carlson hugged his daughter.  ""See? No worries. Now, go get dressed and we'll go eat breakfast. I think I smell pancakes with those eggs."" 

Jenean calmed herself and found that her faith in the box being harmless was restored. She didn't take long to dress and pad down the stairs to breakfast. The kitchen was yellow and cheery with spring green curtains on the window above the kitchen sink. It had an all-white table and chairs with a lime checkered table cloth.  

""Good morning!"" Mrs. Harcourt cried, cheerily, handing Jenean a plate piled high with scrambled eggs, bacon, and buttery pancakes. Emily was already sitting at the table, munching her breakfast, her black hair up in a pony-tail. She smiled at Jenean, her mouth full, and waved. Jenean smiled and waved back. Already, she had concocted a plan to once and for all, prove to Emily that the box was nothing to fear. How to put it into action was the next step.  

""What do you want to do today?!"" Emily shouted. 

""Inside voice, Emily."" Her grandmother said. Emily frowned and turned to her friend, quiet. Jenean pretended to look like she was thinking, then, replied.  

""Let's go look at some of the stuff upstairs since you have so much and maybe later, I can collect my own treasures from the woods. We could make it a hiking adventure!"" Emily clapped her hands together and squealed in delight.  

""That's perfect! I'll give you one of my boxes so we can do that!"" Both Emily and Jenean smiled at each other and began a conversation about who could hold their breath the longest, both trying to outdo the other. Mrs. Harcourt sat down to eat with the two, young girls.  Mr. and Mrs. Carlson soon entered, followed by Mr. Harcourt. They were all chattering away about nothing in particular. 

Finally, they all sat down to eat. Mrs. Carlson was pouring orange juice when she turned to the pair of friends. ""So what are you two up to, today?"" She asked, brightly. 

""We're going hiking!"" Cried Emily and Jenean, together.  

""Jinx!"" They both screamed, pointing at one another.  

""That's good. It's always good for a young child to get fresh air."" Mr. Carlson, said in approval. Breakfast continued on in the normal way. The girls spent the morning talking about childhood fantasies and playing swords with the butter knives, before the adults decided that it was enough, and the adults spent their time talking about affairs of the world, deck repairs, and politics, as well as swapping recipes and the like.  Finally, the girls finished up and ran to the attic, full of old toys, doll houses, and the box. As Emily went through the toys on the lighter side of the room, Jenean made her way to the strange box, hiding in the shadows. She tiptoed quietly, making her way across the room. Her fingers touched on the rusted latch as a scream came from Emily.  

""No! Don't!"" It was too late. The box opened, abruptly. A large dark, phantom like creature burst out, engulfing the room in black smoke. It reached out, grabbing Emily by the hair and dragging her across the floor, her nails digging into the wooden floorboards.  

""NO! NO!!"" Downstairs, not a sound was heard, for the attic playroom was two floors up from the kitchen, and on the other side of the house. Mrs. Harcourt did this for the particular reason as to make sure no one interrupted Mr. Harcourt's afternoon naps. Now, Jenean and Emily were both at the mercy of a monster. From inside the billowing smoke was an unearthly, screaming sound, which rattled the windowpanes, slowly deafening the two girls. 

Smoke filled Jenean's lungs as she grabbed hold of the screaming Emily, in the process, being dragged into the box herself. Finally, Emily broke free, trying to grab Jenean free, as well. The smoke creature became more brutal, tugging at Jenean's very soul. She could feel it, slowly being ripped from her skin, separating her from her very life. Her breath became short and Jenean began to panic. She began kicking and screaming, trying to wrench herself away and suddenly, becoming silent. Finally, unable to drag her away, Emily did the best thing she could think of. She stood, kicked the box, violently across the room, forcing the monster to follow it.  

Emily, chased the box, shut the latch, and placed her hand above the star. She murmured something, quietly, and it stayed shut. Emily then, ran to Jenean's side, holding her hand. Jenean was having heavy, rancorous spasms on the attic floor.  

""Don't worry, Jenean. I know just what to do. That monster won't get either of us, I promise."" 

Running to the other side of the room, Emily grabbed a button eyed rag doll from a toy chest, quickly returning to Jenean. She placed the doll over the young girl's heart, and began to murmur. As she did so, Emily took a small pin from her hair and pricked Jenean's finger. The spasms had slowed, yet hadn't stopped entirely.  

Emily took Jenean's finger and dripped a bit of blood over the chest of the small doll.  Then, a large circle glowed under Jenean surrounded by strange symbols.  It was a short while before the light dimmed and the circle and all its symbols disappeared. By the naked light bulb, two girls rested in the dark end of the playroom. Emily's head hung, exhausted from her work, the small rag doll, glowing faintly, and slowly fading. Jenean's dark body lay limp and cold on the playroom floor.   

Emily placed the rag doll inside a toy chest and slowly dragged Jenean's remains down the stairs and quietly to the back door.  

""We're going hiking, now!"" She cried in the direction of the parlor, no doubt where Mrs. Harcourt was sipping afternoon tea or coffee.  

""Alright, dear!"" Came the reply. ""Be sure to be back before sundown.""  

""We promise!"" Emily, pulled Jenean's corpse out the back door and along the wrap around porch, into the woods where she wouldn't be seen from the road.  Lifting the fellow girl's body as much as she could, she carefully carried her along the trail and to a small ravine. The woods were bright and easy going. The birds were twittering and squirrels chittered in the trees. It was as if nothing unusual had happened; as if no one had just died.  Reaching the ravine, Emily gave out a sigh, picked up Jenean, and walked her body as much as her tiny arms could, along the side of the precipice.  

""Jenean! Don't do that!"" She cried, pulling the body along, beside her, grunting slightly. ""You'll get hurt! Jenean, get down, now!! You'll fall!"" After a few moments of play acting, Emily tossed Jenean's body into the ravine,  small rocks tumbling after her.  

""Jenean!! No!!!"" Emily cried, a squeal following her words. The other girl's body soon lay face down among the rocks and weeds. Emily gazed at her lifeless friend for a few moments, turned and walked, slowly back to the house. As soon as the large country house was in view, she ran as fast as her tiny child legs could carry her, screaming.  

""Grandma! Grandma! Grandma! There was an accident in the ravine! Grandma!!"" Emily barged into the house, down the hall, and into the parlor, screaming. Mrs. Carlson was up from her chair in seconds, Mr. Carlson, pounding down the stairs. 

""What?!"" Cried, Mrs. Carlson. ""Where's Jenean?!"" Emily gave a look of pure despair.  

""She fell in. I can't get her out. I told her not to walk on its edge, but she wouldn't listen and now, I can't get her to wake up to come out!"" Immediately, Mr. Harcourt was throwing down his paper in the kitchen, dialing 911. 

Mrs. Harcourt and Jenean's parents were running out to the ravine. It took twenty minutes of frantic searching to find the place where Jenean had been dumped off the cliff.  At the sight of her daughter, Mrs. Carlson covered her mouth and wailed. Mr. Carlson, began climbing down the ravine to pull the girl's body out. Mrs. Harcourt was still and somber as the poor, young girl was lifted out of the ravine in her father's arms. Holding her to him, he cried and cried.  Mrs. Carlson wrapped her arms around them both. The couple rocked back and forth, sobbing. Jenean hadn't even made it out of grade school and here she was, lying dead in their arms. Bits of blood had formed under the young girl's nails and dried there. Her lips were pure white and her eyes, no longer full of the child-like innocence they once held, only an hour before.  

The wailing police sirens resounded throughout the farmyard and into the woods where the small group stood. Emily stood against a tree, staring at the pain and misery before her. Not a word escaped her lips as the four made their way out of the woods and towards the country road. There was much bustling and shouting as Jenean's  old body was hauled away, covered in a sheet. Mrs. Carlson was on her knees, in the grass.  

Her wails could be heard, high above the sounds of the crows, flying overhead. Mr. Carlson, emptily spoke to the officers and doctors, reporting the details as best as he could. The police and paramedics looked both sympathetic and scared, attempting to bring some order to the situation and keep Mrs. Carlson, from trying to resuscitate her daughter.  Emily slunk away into the house. Slowly, throughout the house and past glass stained windows, she made her way into her attic playroom. The box was not far from her. She ignored it and opened the toy chest with the black button eyed rag doll. A cruel smile lit up her face as shiny, pointed teeth jutted from her mouth.  

""Happy Birthday to me, happy birthday to me!"" She sang, quietly. A small bit of Jenean's blood was still was on the floor, dry now. Bending over it, the small creature licked it up, still smiling, digging her nails into the floor.  Finally, carrying the doll to the parlor, Emily placed it among the others at her tea table. A small, blue tea cup was placed before the doll and filled with imaginary tea. The other dolls seemed to watch her, empathetically. Emily payed no attention. 

""There, Jenean. Just for you."" A wicked grin spread across Emily's face. "" I told you I would have a new toy for my birthday.""  Emily walked back outside, looking just like any frightened child would.  

Taking pity, the police officers decided not to question the girl. She sat on the porch, staring as if in shock at the scene before her, the sun fading away, into the night The parlor grew dark upon the small rag doll, now named Jenean. Her parents returned home in the city, the whole incident considered an accident. They never returned to the old farmhouse just outside town. Soon, the whole incident was left behind, as was the old farmhouse and the small family within.  

Emily's mother never came to pick her up. In fact, Emily didn't even have a mother, or any family for that matter. Mrs. and Mr. Harcourt had never had any children. Where Emily came from, no one knew. 

Of course, when asked, the elderly couple would always swear the young girl was visiting on vacation. Where they picked up such a notion, is a mystery.  Some things are best left a mystery. 

Now, dear parents; remember this Halloween, as you are about to put your children to sleep. Remember as they cry about the monsters in their closets or under their beds, the tale of little Jenean. Remember her tears and fear and her tale full of dread. Remember dear parents, why little Jenean is dead.",2,1763934517.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I was in a bad situation with a narcissist before I met my now husband. For context my stepfather groomed me when I was 14 and manipulated, got me addicted to pillsand isolated me and my mother didn't care until eventually she divorced him and married me, my family totally cut me out. Well I was working at a truck stop when my now husband came in for a coffee when he was shutting down his truck for the night, the coffee maker wouldn't work for him and we talked for hours then I left in the middle of the night and ran away with him after a few days of meeting. Now fast forward and I was rekindling with my family and my brother 27M and his delulu wife came to my grandma's while I was visiting her. My brother and I hadn't seen or talked in 8 years previous to this day and when talked about everything, well my husband just said tomy brothers wife that maybe if we go on vacation they could babysit my unborn son. 

  
A few days later I get a message on Facebook from her saying that she would adopt my son, I started laughing bc she couldn't be serious about it, I planned my son and would never give him away. And my brother and her have been having a rough time trying to have a baby but still I won't give my son away. Anyways I called my grandma and she said ignore the message and I did. Another month goes by and she messages again pushing the issue judging me for being in a semi truck and telling me how im not equipped to have a baby and she is. I called my dad and grandma (my grandma said just remember not to hurt my brothers feelings) to say look it's ridiculous and she needs to stop, my dad said he would talk to her, then told me the next day that I need to talk to her because she's still not understanding. So I call her and it was an argument that im not giving my son to anyone especially not my brother that I haven't seen in 8 years and to stop and leave me alone. Well we found out they wanted to try to adopt my son before he was born, and so that was the last day I spoke to them. They all are hung up on the old me when I was on drugs and not the person I am today where im a great mother sober for 3 years and going to college for nursing. 

I am not pregnant with my second child and it brought up the memories of the stress and drama with my family with my son.

1p4yz1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/slaa/comments/1p4yz1w/ive_ruined_my_life_and_have_hurt_my_wife_so_deeply/,I’ve ruined my life and have hurt my wife so deeply,"I have been addicted to porn since high school. Porn has been and still is a constant to this day. But in college it progressed to seeking casual encounters on online and seeking escorts (sometimes I’d meet and sometimes I just act out on looking and calling them). After college this progressed to seeking encounters and external validation online. I became obsessed.

9 years ago I met the love of my life and now wife. We have been together for 9 years, living together for 8, and married for just over 1. 

This whole time my addiction never stopped. I don’t have many friends aside from my wife and her friends. Outside of the time spent with my wife I would dive deep into this sex addiction online and in real life. I’ve cheated on my wife both virtually and physically in real life.

Just last week we were in Maui on a wonderful vacation with her mom and grandma. Somehow I still couldn’t resist the urge to message people. She saw me acting out. I panicked and tried to lie that it was only virtual. When we got home she found an old phone of mine and logged into my accounts and found EVERYTHING. I am so ashamed of the pictures and messages she saw and read. She now knows this has been going on for our entire relationship and she thinks I’m absolutely disgusting and pure evil. I don’t blame her.

She has already submitted divorce papers for review by the court and is packing all her stuff to move to her moms while she looks for her own apartment. She is so hurt. I hear her crying herself to sleep and crying as she makes her morning coffee. We were best friends and she was everything I thought was good about my life. It’s hard to explain to her that that I still loved her despite everything I’ve done. She yelled that I used to be her comfort and now I’m the source of all the pain. That broke me this morning.

I type this in the middle of packing my own stuff to give her space in our room. Both of our cats are laying on my lap. They know something is wrong..

As much as I would like too, I don’t see anyway of saving my marriage at this point. She has made that pretty clear.

I don’t really know the point of this post other than to get it out here and here from others that have been where I am.

If there’s anything good coming out of this is that it’s out in the public now. Our immediate families and her friends now know. With it being public I feel I can finally confront it. She says it’s only because I was caught and that I’m weak for never coming to her about it or seeking help before getting into the relationship. I can’t argue with that, but I do want to change now.

I’m going to my first SLAA meeting tonight and tomorrow I start outpatient therapy M-F.

I don’t know what’s next. I feel like I ruined my life, but I know with time I will be ok. I just feel so ashamed and sad that I’ve hurt my wife and best friend so deeply and have lost her for good. 💔 ",4,1763934422.0,slaa,1,1.0,False
1p4yy1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1p4yy1i/i_found_this_weird_forest_short_story_wip/,i found this weird forest (Short Story) (WIP),"Growing up in a rather small town in eastern Montana, it was hard to really do anything for fun. There were always the local Walmart and McDonalds and a few convenience stores but outside of that, there was nothing to hold my 17-year-old brain's attention. Luckily for me, there were tons of woodland areas around where i lived so i spent most of my free time exploring the pines and racing sticks down the creek (riveting, i know). Every day after school and on some weekends i would head down to the park connected to the woods and simply just exist and watch the wildlife. I was the adventurist type, always having a knack for exploring and discovering new things and places so you could, hopefully, understand my excitement when i discovered a completely new area of woodland to explore. I was bewildered that I missed what seemed to be acres of unseen woods considering i spent the better part of 3 years exploring my town, but I couldn't be bothered to care, there was somewhere new to explore. It was getting late in the day already, so I had to hold off on exploring until tomorrow. I snapped a picture of the clearing where i would be spending my Saturday and headed home.  

 

As i was walking home, i decided to share the photo i took with a couple of my friends who would sometimes join me on my adventures. Before i could hit send though, i couldn’t help but notice how strange the trees looked in the photo. Maybe it was my crappy phone camera, but it almost looked like the trees were... blurry? The trees had a strange gray grain to them, like an old staticky analog TV. I didn’t think much of it though chalking it up to the way my phone caught the dim autumn light of the trees. Regardless, i sent the photo to my friends.  

 

John: “What's with the filter man? Those trees look fake as hell” 

Tim: “That isn't a filter, it's just the way my camera caught the light” 

John: “Dude, we need to get you a new phone.”  

Ellis: “Is that here? I have never seen that clearing before”  

Tim: “Yeah, it's down at Central Park just past the Pond, i was heading home when i saw it lol. I'm gonna head back to explore tomorrow”  

Ellis: “Oh shit, I'm coming too. I need an excuse to not go to my aunt's birthday” 

Tim: “Awesome, ill head over to your place around 4.”  

Seen by John, Seen by Ellis  

 

My house sat on a tiny corner of land, secluded from the rest of the town. It wasn't anything special, a small one-story speck of wood and brick. It was about 15 minutes away from town and 45 minutes away from the park so i always got a decent walk in whenever I decided to explore. I did not have the privilege of a car or even a driver's license. Money was tight and my family didn't have a car for me to practice in. Ellis had a car, but it was a shitbox that could barely drive five miles without a lightshow dancing on the dash so i walked pretty much everywhere. The transition from sidewalk and light pollution to dirt road and pitch blackness surrounded by mile high trees as i got further from town and closer to home was, in my mind at least, very peaceful and beautiful. Looking up in the night sky and seeing nothing but diamond and emerald twilight is a privilege that not alot of people get and im thankful i get to see it every night. My walk was coming to an end as i saw my house slowly come into view up ahead so i took in the last bit of cosmic wonder and finally i was home 

 

My family was not big by any means. Most of my family either died before i was born or lived too far away to even think of. My mother, Sarah, was an overnight grocery store cashier so i never really saw her after school. My father, Thomas, worked for a trucking company and was never home, always away in some far-off place. I'm an only child and never see my folks so you can see why i like to spend my time outdoors. It was always lonely coming home to an empty house. No commotion from a big family, no smell of fresh home cooked meals. Just an empty space filled with even emptier darkness. Almost immediately after walking through the front door, i plopped down on the couch and reviewed the photo i took with much more focus then i had prior and i came to a very eye-opening conclusion... i needed a new phone. Like John said, the trees looked as if a filter was placed over them giving them an almost gray water colored painting aesthetic. It was equally beautiful and strange. Realizing that it was nearing 11 pm, i decided to wind down and get some sleep. I had a huge day ahead of must needed rest. I headed up to my room and called it a night, laying under a vast blanket of stars just outside my room.  

 

 

Every morning, the sun would shine bright and warm through my window. I almost never needed to set an alarm because of this and always woke up around 8-9 am on weekends. Saturday mornings were never eventful for me, i'd make breakfast and either go into town to hangout with Ellis and John or stay behind and help out around the house if needed. Today, my mom was working a double shift, so I made my self useful and cleaned up around the house. As the clock ticked toward 3, I got ready for mine and Ellis’ trip to the clearing, or as John has nicknamed it, “The Twilight Zone”. I scarfed down a bowl of cereal and packed a small bag for the excursion. Packing flashlights, extra food, sweaters, radios (you never know), my trusty pocketknife, and some water. I left my mom a note letting her know where I would be and that would be staying at Ellis’ house for the evening but that I'll be sure to call her around 10 to let her know I was safe and sound. My mom had enough stress in her life so I wanted to make sure that I could elevate some of that stress by just being a good Son. I loved my mom.  

 

“Hey Ellis, i'm on my way. I packed us some supplies incase we need anything. I found my dad’s old radios he would use on the road, and I thought it would be a good idea to have on hand”  

“Alright awesome, i'll see you soon.”  

 

Ellis lived in what i'd consider the rich part of town, a gated suburb of 2-4 story houses with driveways of Priuses. His house was a 3-story building equipped with a chimney and garage, something I always thought was a sign of wealth. It felt like entering a whole new world when I visited his house. His mom and dad worked from home as Accountants and Architects respectively, so he always had company. After what felt like a walk that lasted years, I finally knocked on his front door 

 

“Oh, Hello Timothy, I didn't know Ellis was having company today” His mother answered the door with a warm smile. “HANG ON ILL GET THE DO- oh” Ellis exclaimed, running down the staircase at breakneck speed. “Hi Ms. Fargo, me and Ellis were gonna head to Central for the day and, if it was okay with you, could I stay the night afterwards?” after a moment of consideration, she turned around to Ellis. “Ellis. You know that today is Aunt Beth’s birthday.” “I know mom but I haven't even met the lady more than three times…” Ellis’ mom turned back toward me, clearly uncomfortable by the situation she was put into. “Well. If you boys can promise to be back by 8:30, I suppose you can go. We can discuss a sleepover when you guys come back.” Ellis, who was now squeezing past his mom and I, stood up straight and said, “We PROMISE!” giving a salute and crossing his heart. “I mean it Ellis. 8:30 sharp.” Ellis was already down the driveway, nodding dismissively and not hearing his mothers warning. “We will be back by 8:30, promise.” I said while turning toward the driveway.  

 

Ellis sat eagerly in his beat up 2001 Corolla waiting for me to call shotgun. “Do we really have to take your car… the thing sounds like it's gonna explode.” He shot me a look of genuine offense “HEY! This car got me through 3 winters. It can surely get us to the park and back.” I sighed in defeat and hopped in, struggling to open the passenger door due to the handle not being entirely connected to the car. “You gotta wiggle the door a bit to get it open, Tim” He said, acting like every car ever made had that “feature.” Sure enough, I shook the door, and it swung open. “Man, you need a new car, El.” I said, trying my best to fit my backpack between my legs. “Hey at least I have a car, Timmy” He chuckled. “Hey man low blow, you know money is tig-“ He cranked up the radio, cutting me off “WHAT? I CANT HEAR YOU OVER JAMES HETFIELD” i was in for a long day. We finally rolled out of the driveway and began our journey into the unknown.  

 

To say I was excited would be an understatement. Central Park was a hot spot for families to visit in the summer and spring but in the fall and winter it was, usually, pretty dead. Autumn and Winter always hit Montana hard and almost everyone agreed that staying warm inside was much better then walking around a barren dead park. So, when Ellis and I arrived at the park, we weren't surprised to see that it was only me and him there. As we pulled up alongside the sidewalk, I pulled out the two radios I took from my parents' bedroom and tuned them both to the same channel. “Jeez, how far into this clearing were you planning on going?” Ellis said, taking the radio I offered him. “Not too far but you never know. Plus, it makes us feel more professional,” i said, clipping the radio to my jean pocket. “Cmon let's go, it's already almost 5 and it's gonna start getting dark” I said, gesturing to the dimming horizon. We left the warm sanctuary of Ellis’ car and headed towards the clearing, knowing it was just past the pond. Central Park was not a big park by any means. It was honestly just a medium sized circle surrounded by wood, so we approached the pond rather quickly and just beyond the water was clearing.  

 

“Well, the trees definitely aren’t blurry” I said, kinda disappointed that it was just a trick of the light but they were gray and dying. Me and Ellis, now directly infront of the clearing, noticed that the trail was very unkept. Like, very very unkept. Debris were scattered everywhere from the trees above and the ground itself seemed damp and lifeless, which was a stark contrast from the park itself, which was full of vibrant colors and very kept grass.           

We pressed on, fighting through hanging branches and fallen trees. Eventually, we came to a clearing in the forest. The trees rose high above the earth as if they were caught in its orbit, and the leaves were no longer dead or dying but instead were beautiful shades of orange and red. It was the complete opposite of what we were expecting to find. “Did we make a wrong turn at some point?” “N-No i don't think so”. The confusion was made manifest when we heard a telephone ring. We swung our heads around to find where the sound was coming from, but all we saw was twilight and leaves. The ringing grew louder and more desperate, causing the trees themselves to shake down to their roots. The ringing got to an unbreable frequency, each ring causing a mind splitting headache to form. “TIM WHAT IS THAT NOISE??” Ellis was on the ground, covering his ears and stuffing them with the falling leaves. My mouth was dry, i could taste my own blood and my vision was giving out. The last thing i remember was Ellis screaming.  

 

 

I awoke propped up against a tree, covered in soot and sap. My head felt like a brick and my legs were incredibly bruised. My left arm was limp, and my right arm was one wrong move from being broken. I reached, pitifully, for my radio. “Ellis... where are you?” Nothing but static and wavering radio signals. The longer i was concious, the more aware my body became of the damage that was done and the shock of the situation slowly lifted, leaving my body with an endless barrage of pain. Trying to move felt like every muscle in my body was trying to escape my body. I slowly stood up, using a stick as a makeshift cane, and I hobbled off back to Ellis’ car.  

 

 

What was orginlly a 15 minute walk took me almost 45 minutes. My legs were almost useless and my arms were only good for supporting the cane. The entire walk back to Ellis’ car was Hell. The sounds of twigs snapping and animal calls in the distance reminded me of the dire domain i was in. As i closed the distance, i noticed something. The trail that lead into the forest was freshly paved as if it was just paved. Walking on it felt like i was walking on smooth carpet which was a stark difference from the rough, rocky terrain i was enduring.  

 

I reached the entrance of the secluded forest and began through the park. It was busier than usual, something that i was praying not to be the case because i did not want anyone thinking i was some crazy forest dweller. I noticed that everyone was very still and quiet, even the children were playing with melancholy. It was strange but i needed to find Ellis, so my mind did not pay attention to it. I exited the park and walked towards the street we parked on. I noticed that the cell phone tower that was, usually, right next to the park was seemingly gone. There was no construction equipment and no signs that there had ever been a cell tower there. I did not know what to make of it but i saw Ellis’ car so i could regain my composure there. The hope of seclusion was overshadowed by Ellis’ disappearance and the ringing that seemed to cause all of this. What made that horrid sound? Why were those people at the park so alien? My brain tried to rationalize everything but all i could think of was finding Ellis and going home. I pulled out my phone to try and get ahold of him and his mom. Luckily, my phone wasn't too badly damaged. A couple of scratches and my phone case was missing but other than that, it was practically mint condition. Noticing that it was almost 6 PM, i called Ellis’ mom first but was immediately met with a robotic woman’s voice stating “This call cannot be completed. Goodbye” “What? What the fuck?”  

 

I, hopelessly, called Ellis’ phone hoping that he simply walked home. Instead, i was met with the same robotic nihilism. None of this made any sense. Ive lived here for years, i would know where the cell towers were and were not and i know that pavement on the trail was not there when me and Ellis got here. Thinking that the phone issue was my phone acting up, I ultimately decided to walk over to the drugstore and use their phone. Each step was agony but I endured. When i made it on to the busy sidewalk, a few yards away from the park, I noticed that all the people were dressed in sack suits and coat dresses. I was wearing a Tears for Fears shirt so i felt very informal. Aside from a few strange glances at my clothes and my strange goblin-like hobbles, they did not pay me much attention. I made my way down towards the store when i realized the entire layout of the town was different. Stores and buisnesses were in completely different areas and there were stores i had never even heard of. There were not that many cars but the few cars i did see were very old Chryslers and Toyotas. I eventually made it to a store, not the drugstore that i was expecting, but i was running out of daylight so i needed to hurry.  

 

I walked inside of the store and was hit by an aroma of burgers and fries. Turns out this wasn't a store but rather a walk-in diner. I rushed over to the counter and pleaded to use their phone. “Phone? I aint got no telephone but what i do gots is some damn near delectable steaks” My mind was racing. I felt like i was invading a new world. Nothing seemed right and everyone looked at me like i was crazy. I decided to stay at the diner to eat and regain my strength so i could walk over to Ellis’ house. As i was seated, i was given a menu, newspaper and a cup of coffee. After placing my order for a “roadhouse runt burger”, I noticed the date on the paper.

For reference, I’m 21 F, I work at my family’s business which mostly consists of 30+ y.o. coworkers in my small hometown city. All my friends decided to stay in the big city after graduation, I’m one of the very few that moved back home. I’ve always been shy and awkward, but growing up at least times were different.

I feel like back then people hung out more, there was more activities, more reasons to go out. Recently everyone feels so closed off, and every outing I join not only feels fake, but also leaves me feeling more alone and unproductive. Maybe I feel like this because the weather is getting colder, but I can’t help the looming dread of loneliness.

Often times I want to go out just for the sake of it, go hiking, a walk, a coffee, anything remotely fun, but I have no one that answers my call. No boyfriend, and my friends live away. It doesn’t help that it feels like at my age nobody wants to connect anymore, and making friends seems impossible. 

Going out with my family has always felt like chore as well, mostly because I’m always there more as a prop than as a person: Just for the photos, not really for the conversation.

I’m not sure how to word this, or what really the problem is. Just that I feel alone, disconnected, and frustrated. And seriously wondering how nobody else around me sees this problem? We have lost clubs, communities, ways to meet people outside of a follow request or other digital forms.

Any and all advice is welcome. I know I’m young and shouldn’t be stressing about this as much, but I don’t want to feel so anxious anymore.",1,1763934298.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I've always thought the hand-drawn designs on their packaging were cute and had a certain charm that made them stand out. Looks like the company is going a different direction.

Several ways to see this is AI - one hand in Santa has 4 fingers, the other has 5. His foot is morphing into the donkey. If you zoom in on the coffee bags, you can see gibberish above the BCR. The small donkey looks too much like a copy-paste miniature, and several of the plants on the side and back seem to be blurring into each other, or into nothing in the background.

Hope to see better packaging choices from BCR in the future.

Porn has been and still is a constant to this day. But in college it progressed to seeking casual encounters on online and seeking escorts (sometimes I’d meet and sometimes I just act out on looking and calling them). After college this progressed to seeking encounters and external validation online. I became obsessed.

9 years ago I met the love of my life and now wife. We have been together for 9 years, living together for 8, and married for just over 1. 

This whole time my addiction never stopped. I don’t have many friends aside from my wife and her friends. Outside of the time spent with my wife I would dive deep into this sex addiction online and in real life. I’ve cheated on my wife both virtually and physically in real life.

Just last week we were in Maui on a wonderful vacation with her mom and grandma. Somehow I still couldn’t resist the urge to message people. She saw me acting out. I panicked and tried to lie that it was only virtual. When we got home she found an old phone of mine and logged into my accounts and found EVERYTHING. I am so ashamed of the pictures and messages she saw and read. She now knows this has been going on for our entire relationship and she thinks I’m absolutely disgusting and pure evil. I don’t blame her.

She has already submitted divorce papers for review by the court and is packing all her stuff to move to her moms while she looks for her own apartment. She is so hurt. I hear her crying herself to sleep and crying as she makes her morning coffee. We were best friends and she was everything I thought was good about my life. It’s hard to explain to her that that I still loved her despite everything I’ve done. She yelled that I used to be her comfort and now I’m the source of all the pain. That broke me this morning.

I type this in the middle of packing my own stuff to give her space in our room. Both of our cats are laying on my lap. They know something is wrong..

As much as I would like too, I don’t see anyway of saving my marriage at this point. She has made that pretty clear.

I don’t really know the point of this post other than to get it out here and here from others that have been where I am.

If there’s anything good coming out of this is that it’s out in the public now. Our immediate families and her friends now know. With it being public I feel I can finally confront it. She says it’s only because I was caught and that I’m weak for never coming to her about it or seeking help before getting into the relationship. I can’t argue with that, but I do want to change now.

I’m going to my first SLAA meeting tonight and tomorrow I start outpatient therapy M-F.

I don’t know what’s next. I feel like I ruined my life, but I know with time I will be ok. I just feel so ashamed and sad that I’ve hurt my wife and best friend so deeply and have lost her for good. 💔 ",4,1763933679.0,SexAddiction,6,1.0,False

I, '17 F' met a girl '17 F' We started talking because we are in the same math class and in October she suggested we go on a date but canceled it not long after saying she felt uncomfortable.

We've been talking since September so it's around 3 months now

Yet, in school she still talked to me and we kept flirting and everytime we finished math class we would sit together near the school and in the past week i also started walking her home and at one point I sat with her under her house for like 4 hours.

We had a school trip last week and we shared the room. In the trip itself we didn't talk much but in the room she persisted on putting lipstick on my lips, noticed when I wasn't near her and asked me to sit in her bunk. When she didn't feel good she held onto my hand and didn't leave it and we walked together as we laughed. I also bought her a coffee and a shirt.

Lasy Friday, I invited her home with a couple of friends and I got drunk. We ended up playing truth or dare. One dare my friend gave us was to play 7 minutes in heaven and we just talked but she said ""you do know that they're planning to make us kiss right?""

Eventually that's what happened and they dared us to kiss. I was really drunk yet I still asked her if she was alright with it and she said ""I don't mind"" and we kissed for like 10 seconds.

After that I was super drunk I couldn't stand on my own and I ended up laying down on her lap and everytime I got up she asked me if I'm OK and if I need help and eventually I wanted to change clothes and she followed me to my room without asking her to and she helped me change and when she had to go (I don't really remember that part) my friend told me that we hugged for like a couple of minutes without stopping.

Honestly idk what to think. I'm really attracted to her but I'm not really sure if she's attracted to me too and I don't want to ruin what we have. Does it seem like she's into me?

Like all of my friends are calling me stupid for jot seeing it, and when one of my friends asked that girl's best friend about if we're together, her best friend replied with ""not yet""",0,1763933655.0,LesbianActually,0,0.5,False

So I built my own | Update & Black Friday Lifetime Offer","About a month ago, I posted here about how I started building my own player (**Abookio**) to keep myself grounded while fixing up the house and taking care of my dad. That post blew up (40k views!), and the support from this sub was honestly one of the highlights of my year.



**But here is the funny thing:** I actually released the app about 10 days ago. I made a ""Launch Announcement,"" but I think I tried too hard to sound professional and corporate, so it completely flopped. I still see people commenting on my old post asking if the app is out yet, or sharing it not realizing it's actually live.



So, I’m posting this update to let you guys know: [It is live.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/abookio-audiobook-player/id6754542041)



And I’ve just added three big features based on stuff that was annoying me while listening over the last few weeks:

**1. The ""How do you spell that?"" Fix (EPUB Reader)** [Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/ntrFOf3)

I was listening to *Metro 2033* (and tried to finish *Anna Karenina* before that), and I kept getting pulled out of focus because I couldn't differentiate the foreign names.

* **The Fix:** I added a full **EPUB Reader** inside the player so you can load the text file alongside the audio.
* **The ""Magic"" Part:** To make it seamless, if the chapter names match in both files (e.g. ""Chapter 5""), you can just tap the chapter title in the 'Now Playing' screen and it opens the text right to that exact spot.

**2. The ""Where is this?"" Fix (Smart Maps)** See it in action [here](https://imgur.com/a/wl77nUY)

I switched to non-fiction recently (*Blood in the Water* about Attica Prison, and *The Innocent Man*). I found myself often pausing to Google what the prison layout looked like or what the town of Ada, Oklahoma actually felt like.

* **The Fix:** I added a **Smart Location Map**. It uses on-device smarts (Apple Intelligence) to try and guess the location in the book and pin it on a map for you, so you can see the setting without leaving the app.

**3. The ""Messy Library"" Fix (OCR Metadata)** [Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/pi64sAe)

I have a lot of older files where the tags are a total mess (missing narrators, wrong authors, ""Track 01"").

* **The Fix:** I built a high-quality metadata importer that cleans up your library automatically.
* **The Cool Detail:** If the narrator tag is missing, the app actually uses OCR to scan the text on the cover art, finds the narrator's name, and fills it in for you.





**The ""No-Subscription"" Black Friday Offer** I know everyone here hates subscriptions (I do too). Since most of you missed the actual launch, I’m doing a **Lifetime unlock for $3.99** until December 8th. You pay once, you own it forever. No ads, no data harvesting, no servers tracking you.



**A quick note on the price:** I tried to make it as cheap as a coffee, but I know times are tough right now. If $3.99 is out of reach for you, whether you're a student, in between jobs, or just in a tight spot, please don’t be scared to reach out. Just drop me a DM and I’ll gladly send you a free promo code, no questions asked. Everyone deserves access to books.



**For those who missed the first post, the basics are:**

* **Privacy:** No analytics, no tracking. Your data stays on your phone.
* **Cloud:** Connects to Box, Drobbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, pCloud and WebDAV.
* **Selfhosted**: Audiobookshelf, Jellyfin, Plex
* **Formats:** Plays basically everything (m4b, mp3, etc).

I’d love for you to give it a try and for those who supported me on that first post (and second) a few weeks back, thanks again for helping me get this across the finish line.

1p4ynn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1p4ynn5/do_not_watch_this/,Do Not Watch This,"I’m writing this here now because I’m not sure when I’ll get another chance. I’m not sure I’ll live long enough to recount this event in its entirety. 

My name is Donavin Meeks. I’m 22 years old, and last month, I found a VHS tape. 

I had been rummaging through my attic, searching for some old Halloween costumes I could pull back out for old times' sake, just to get into the ol’ holiday spirit. 

I’ll preface by saying, much like many others, my attic was almost backroom-ish. 

The way the dust had collected amongst the clutter, and how the cobwebs seemed to decorate the beams that supported my roof, the atmosphere alone was unsettling enough. 

As I searched through box after box of old knick-knacks, photo albums, and stocking stuffers that nobody used anymore, I finally managed to find the cardboard box labeled “Halloween” with a little cutely drawn spider with a smiley face beside it. 

All hail the Gods of irony, because as soon as I lifted the box, the biggest black widow I’d ever seen came running out, its legs clicking against the hardwood.

I *hate* spiders, so this obviously caused me to jump backwards, tripping and falling over some other boxes and immediately flailing like a maniac in fear of a bite from the arachnid. 

Hopping to my feet and checking ferociously for any sign of the thing on any part of my body, I happened to glance down at the mess of boxes I had just created. 

Lying in the center of the scattered clothing and Christmas decorations, lie a VHS tape. 

Unlike the other items, the VHS tape was completely dust free, and seemed as though it had been watched to about the halfway point. 

I picked it up to analyze it and found that it had been labeled “Do Not Watch” in black permanent marker over white painters tape. 

Staring at the words, I couldn’t help but feel utter intrigue. 

Not only had I never seen the tape, I had never even OWNED a VHS player. 

I mean, I’m 22, honestly, what am I going to use one of those things for? 

The dams of curiosity broke within the first two minutes of my discovery, and off I went, down to the local pawn shop to find my VHS player. 

It cost me a solid $5.98. One of the perks of being obsolete, I guess. 
Upon returning home, I was bewildered to find that the mysterious videotape was no longer on the coffee table where I had left it. 

Living alone, this turned out to be incredibly concerning to me. 

I began to rack my brain, thinking of how I could have misplaced the thing. 

I distinctly remembered placing it directly in the center of my coffee table. I mean, I checked under the couches, on the dining room table, my bedroom, bathroom, every room in my house had been checked. 

I began thinking that it was my mind that had been lost instead of that damn tape. 

I stayed up into the early morning hours because the idea of something that distinct just vanishing like that; it irked me. 

My mind already tends to wander and teeter on borderline paranoid schizophrenia, and this event did NOT help. 

Once I finally DID choose to go to bed, my sleep was shakey at best. 

I couldn’t have been asleep for more than an hour and a half when the abrupt sounds of what seemed to be footsteps awoke me. 

I could have swore that I heard the sound coming from directly above me, yet, once I fully regained consciousness, they had stopped completely. 

I had first put it off as a dream, a mere trick of the mind, similar that feeling you get when you’re falling in your sleep. 

That thought gave me comfort, and allowed me to doze back into sleep. However, that comfort was quickly vanquished when the same sounds started up yet again. 

This time I KNEW what I had heard, and I wasn’t about to just lay in bed defenseless. 

I immediately threw the covers off of myself and grabbed the bat that I keep beside my bed in case of home intruders just like this one. 

Being sure to make a lot of noise so the intruder KNEW that I was coming. I wanted them afraid, I wanted them to feel what I had been feeling. 

I yanked the attic door down and began climbing the ladder, flashlight in one hand, bat in the other. 

I hyped myself up as I ascended, preparing myself for whatever may lay within the plane of darkness which is my attic. 

Once I got about 6 inches from the entrance, I called out. 

“I know you’re up there! I hope you know I’m calling the cops, AND I’m armed. So just come on out please. Don’t make this any harder than it needs to be.” 

I waited a few moments and received no response. 

The silence was daunting, and cut through me.

The hot attic air seemed to grow chilled. A distinct drop in temperature that made me shiver. 

“Just come on out, man. We can work this out just as soon as you come out and make yourself known!” 

I waited a few moments once more, and once more, received no response. 

“Alright, I’m coming up! I swear to God if I see any movement whatsoever from you, I am bashing your head in!” 

I slowly began to ascend what remained of the ladder. 

My right palm sweat profusely wrapped around the rubber grip of the bat, whereas my left hand shook the beam of the flashlight ever so slightly. 

I began to scan the room with the beam, making sure light touched every surface possible from the attic entrance. 

Everything seemed still. Calm. Untouched, if it weren’t for where the few boxes I had knocked over prior. 

Though my light landed on no one, it did happen to fall upon a familiar plastic black rectangle, placed right back in the center of the spilled clutter. 

“No fucking way…” I thought to myself. 

Cautiously, I made my way towards the VHS tape, practically spinning in circles with my flashlight as I inched closer. 

Still, no sign of an intruder. 

I reached down and retrieved the VHS tape. 

Just then, a whole wall of boxes came tumbling over from across the attic, followed by the sounds of swift footsteps that seemed to approach me at an inhuman pace, only to completely dissipate as soon as it was before me. 

The flashlight and bat were both shaking wildly now as I spun around the room, sweating and petrified. 

“COME OUT! COME OUT RIGHT NOW!” I screamed. 

The attic was now eerily silent again. 

As I stood there, shaking and on the brink of a panic attack, the sound of creaking floorboards scratched the back of my mind, and a deep, booming voice spoke from behind me. 

“Boo.” 

I flew across the attic at a speed I didn’t know I was possible of achieving, 

I was down the ladder so fast that my foot ended up getting caught on the last rung, causing my ankle to twist, followed by a sickening POP that shot pain throughout my entire leg. 

I had saved my videotape though, and this time, it wasn’t leaving my side. 

I ended up having to spend the rest of the night and next morning in the hospital getting x-rayed and having my foot casted up. 

I had ended up breaking my ankle, and all I could tell the doctors was I tripped while climbing out of the attic. 

Anyway, I returned home as soon as I was cleared, anxious to finally watch this VHS that seemed to had randomly appeared in my home, as well as some sort of unwanted visitor. 

I never really fed into the whole paranormal thing, but holy shit, man. The true horror that I felt in that moment up in that attic; it made me a believer instantly. 

Well, I should say that it made me believe that things can be ATTACHED to objects. Whether it be holy or demonic. Attachments can happen. 

And I believe that’s what the case was with this tape. 

Once I arrived home, I was determined to finally view its contents.  

Something that I had failed to notice upon retrieving the tape from the attic was that now, instead of being half way through, it was completely rewound to the very beginning. 

Not only that, but the black marker had now been turned…red? It looked as though a completely new label had been placed on the tape. It looked…flashier. Like the *CAUTION* tag on a bottle of chemicals. 

“DO. NOT. WATCH. THIS.” 

Yeah, right. Who WOULD’NT watch this? 

Arriving home, I found that my house had been completely trashed. 

Cabinets were thrown open, couch cushions ripped off and strewn across the floor, pots and pans sat neatly across every counter top. 

Luckily for me, my VHS player had remained untouched, and sat where it had been just below the TV stand. 

Unbothered by the mess, unbothered by the clear red flags, I sat down in front of my television and popped the tape into the player. 

Nothing happened at first. Just a black screen that lingered. 

Suddenly, blasting white and black static came scratching across the display. 

I jumped a bit, and felt my heart drop before steadying. 

Slowly but surely, the picture began to become clear and smooth. 

The first thing to come into view was a mailbox. 

A mailbox that stood displaying my exact address. 

My heart began to speed up again. 

As the picture video became clearer, I was able to make out the sidewalk that led to my front porch. 

Then my front door. 

Then my stairs.

The attic door. 

The ladder. 

And then darkness as the person recording nestled into a dark corner within the attic. 

The video then remained that way. Black stillness for an uncomfortably long period of time. 

There was a sudden and harsh skip in the frames and now the camera was panned to the attic door from within the attic. 

Distinct shadows could be seen through the cracks in the doorframe, shadows that seemed to be that of a certain 22 year old man, living alone. 

There was another cut, and now the recorder appeared to be crouched in a new corner of the attic, filming as the door to the fell open and footsteps began to climb the ladder. 

I watched in horror as my own head popped into frame, waddling up the stairs, completely oblivious, as I searched through box after box for a stupid Halloween costume. 

The video then abruptly ended, right before the black widow came crawling out from under the package causing me to jump backwards and fall. 

The next cut was a shot of my living room. It showed the camera slowly approaching the tape that lay on my coffee table. 

Another sudden cut. 

A hand was now in frame, pale and decrepit. It carefully placed my silver spaghetti pot atop the kitchen counter before patting it softly, then panning the camera around the room to reveal the mess that had been created. 

The next and final cut revealed me, yet again, cautiously searching the addict with a flashlight. Eyes wide and apprehension painted clearly across my face. 


I stared at the television in absolute dismay. Frozen. My jaw dropped cleanly to the floor. 

I remained in a trance-like state for the remainder of the footage, broken only when the video abruptly ended, and was somehow replaced by live footage. 

Live footage that showed a 22 year old man, who lives alone, sitting in awe, as he watched himself on the television. 

My mind took longer than I care to admit for it to put the pieces together, but once it did, it was too late, and the sound of heavy footsteps began echoing from the television, and the live footage inched closer and closer to my spot on the sofa.

I, '18 F' met a girl '18 F' We started talking because we are in the same math class and in October she suggested we go on a date but canceled it not long after saying she felt uncomfortable.

We've been talking since September so it's around 3 months now

Yet, in school she still talked to me and we kept flirting and everytime we finished math class we would sit together near the school and in the past week i also started walking her home and at one point I sat with her under her house for like 4 hours.

We had a school trip last week and we shared the room. In the trip itself we didn't talk much but in the room she persisted on putting lipstick on my lips, noticed when I wasn't near her and asked me to sit in her bunk. When she didn't feel good she held onto my hand and didn't leave it and we walked together as we laughed. I also bought her a coffee and a shirt.

Lasy Friday, I invited her home with a couple of friends and I got drunk. We ended up playing truth or dare. One dare my friend gave us was to play 7 minutes in heaven and we just talked but she said ""you do know that they're planning to make us kiss right?""

Eventually that's what happened and they dared us to kiss. I was really drunk yet I still asked her if she was alright with it and she said ""I don't mind"" and we kissed for like 10 seconds.

After that I was super drunk I couldn't stand on my own and I ended up laying down on her lap and everytime I got up she asked me if I'm OK and if I need help and eventually I wanted to change clothes and she followed me to my room without asking her to and she helped me change and when she had to go (I don't really remember that part) my friend told me that we hugged for like a couple of minutes without stopping.

Honestly idk what to think. I'm really attracted to her but I'm not really sure if she's attracted to me too and I don't want to ruin what we have. Does it seem like she's into me?

My name is Donavin Meeks. I’m 22 years old, and last month, I found a VHS tape. 

I had been rummaging through my attic, searching for some old Halloween costumes I could pull back out for old times' sake, just to get into the ol’ holiday spirit. 

I’ll preface by saying, much like many others, my attic was almost backroom-ish. 

The way the dust had collected amongst the clutter, and how the cobwebs seemed to decorate the beams that supported my roof, the atmosphere alone was unsettling enough. 

As I searched through box after box of old knick-knacks, photo albums, and stocking stuffers that nobody used anymore, I finally managed to find the cardboard box labeled “Halloween” with a little cutely drawn spider with a smiley face beside it. 

All hail the Gods of irony, because as soon as I lifted the box, the biggest black widow I’d ever seen came running out, its legs clicking against the hardwood.

I *hate* spiders, so this obviously caused me to jump backwards, tripping and falling over some other boxes and immediately flailing like a maniac in fear of a bite from the arachnid. 

Hopping to my feet and checking ferociously for any sign of the thing on any part of my body, I happened to glance down at the mess of boxes I had just created. 

Lying in the center of the scattered clothing and Christmas decorations, lie a VHS tape. 

Unlike the other items, the VHS tape was completely dust free, and seemed as though it had been watched to about the halfway point. 

I picked it up to analyze it and found that it had been labeled “Do Not Watch” in black permanent marker over white painters tape. 

Staring at the words, I couldn’t help but feel utter intrigue. 

Not only had I never seen the tape, I had never even OWNED a VHS player. 

I mean, I’m 22, honestly, what am I going to use one of those things for? 

The dams of curiosity broke within the first two minutes of my discovery, and off I went, down to the local pawn shop to find my VHS player. 

It cost me a solid $5.98. One of the perks of being obsolete, I guess. 
Upon returning home, I was bewildered to find that the mysterious videotape was no longer on the coffee table where I had left it. 

Living alone, this turned out to be incredibly concerning to me. 

I began to rack my brain, thinking of how I could have misplaced the thing. 

I distinctly remembered placing it directly in the center of my coffee table. I mean, I checked under the couches, on the dining room table, my bedroom, bathroom, every room in my house had been checked. 

I began thinking that it was my mind that had been lost instead of that damn tape. 

I stayed up into the early morning hours because the idea of something that distinct just vanishing like that; it irked me. 

My mind already tends to wander and teeter on borderline paranoid schizophrenia, and this event did NOT help. 

Once I finally DID choose to go to bed, my sleep was shakey at best. 

I couldn’t have been asleep for more than an hour and a half when the abrupt sounds of what seemed to be footsteps awoke me. 

I could have swore that I heard the sound coming from directly above me, yet, once I fully regained consciousness, they had stopped completely. 

I had first put it off as a dream, a mere trick of the mind, similar that feeling you get when you’re falling in your sleep. 

That thought gave me comfort, and allowed me to doze back into sleep. However, that comfort was quickly vanquished when the same sounds started up yet again. 

This time I KNEW what I had heard, and I wasn’t about to just lay in bed defenseless. 

I immediately threw the covers off of myself and grabbed the bat that I keep beside my bed in case of home intruders just like this one. 

Being sure to make a lot of noise so the intruder KNEW that I was coming. I wanted them afraid, I wanted them to feel what I had been feeling. 

I yanked the attic door down and began climbing the ladder, flashlight in one hand, bat in the other. 

I hyped myself up as I ascended, preparing myself for whatever may lay within the plane of darkness which is my attic. 

Once I got about 6 inches from the entrance, I called out. 

“I know you’re up there! I hope you know I’m calling the cops, AND I’m armed. So just come on out please. Don’t make this any harder than it needs to be.” 

I waited a few moments and received no response. 

The silence was daunting, and cut through me.

The hot attic air seemed to grow chilled. A distinct drop in temperature that made me shiver. 

“Just come on out, man. We can work this out just as soon as you come out and make yourself known!” 

I waited a few moments once more, and once more, received no response. 

“Alright, I’m coming up! I swear to God if I see any movement whatsoever from you, I am bashing your head in!” 

I slowly began to ascend what remained of the ladder. 

My right palm sweat profusely wrapped around the rubber grip of the bat, whereas my left hand shook the beam of the flashlight ever so slightly. 

I began to scan the room with the beam, making sure light touched every surface possible from the attic entrance. 

Everything seemed still. Calm. Untouched, if it weren’t for where the few boxes I had knocked over prior. 

Though my light landed on no one, it did happen to fall upon a familiar plastic black rectangle, placed right back in the center of the spilled clutter. 

“No fucking way…” I thought to myself. 

Cautiously, I made my way towards the VHS tape, practically spinning in circles with my flashlight as I inched closer. 

Still, no sign of an intruder. 

I reached down and retrieved the VHS tape. 

Just then, a whole wall of boxes came tumbling over from across the attic, followed by the sounds of swift footsteps that seemed to approach me at an inhuman pace, only to completely dissipate as soon as it was before me. 

The flashlight and bat were both shaking wildly now as I spun around the room, sweating and petrified. 

“COME OUT! COME OUT RIGHT NOW!” I screamed. 

The attic was now eerily silent again. 

As I stood there, shaking and on the brink of a panic attack, the sound of creaking floorboards scratched the back of my mind, and a deep, booming voice spoke from behind me. 

“Boo.” 

I flew across the attic at a speed I didn’t know I was possible of achieving, 

I was down the ladder so fast that my foot ended up getting caught on the last rung, causing my ankle to twist, followed by a sickening POP that shot pain throughout my entire leg. 

I had saved my videotape though, and this time, it wasn’t leaving my side.

Not only that, but the black marker had now been turned…red? It looked as though a completely new label had been placed on the tape. It looked…flashier. Like the *CAUTION* tag on a bottle of chemicals. 

“DO. NOT. WATCH. THIS.” 

Yeah, right. Who WOULD’NT watch this? 

Arriving home, I found that my house had been completely trashed. 

Cabinets were thrown open, couch cushions ripped off and strewn across the floor, pots and pans sat neatly across every counter top. 

Luckily for me, my VHS player had remained untouched, and sat where it had been just below the TV stand.

Not only that, but the black marker had now been turned…red? It looked as though a completely new label had been placed on the tape. It looked…flashier. Like the *CAUTION* tag on a bottle of chemicals. 

“DO. NOT. WATCH. THIS.” 

Yeah, right. Who WOULD’NT watch this? 

Arriving home, I found that my house had been completely trashed. 

Cabinets were thrown open, couch cushions ripped off and strewn across the floor, pots and pans sat neatly across every counter top. 

Luckily for me, my VHS player had remained untouched, and sat where it had been just below the TV stand. 

Unbothered by the mess, unbothered by the clear red flags, I sat down in front of my television and popped the tape into the player. 

Nothing happened at first. Just a black screen that lingered. 

Suddenly, blasting white and black static came scratching across the display. 

I jumped a bit, and felt my heart drop before steadying. 

Slowly but surely, the picture began to become clear and smooth. 

The first thing to come into view was a mailbox. 

A mailbox that stood displaying my exact address. 

My heart began to speed up again. 

As the picture video became clearer, I was able to make out the sidewalk that led to my front porch. 

Then my front door. 

Then my stairs.

The attic door. 

The ladder. 

And then darkness as the person recording nestled into a dark corner within the attic. 

The video then remained that way. Black stillness for an uncomfortably long period of time. 

There was a sudden and harsh skip in the frames and now the camera was panned to the attic door from within the attic. 

Distinct shadows could be seen through the cracks in the doorframe, shadows that seemed to be that of a certain 22 year old man, living alone. 

There was another cut, and now the recorder appeared to be crouched in a new corner of the attic, filming as the door to the fell open and footsteps began to climb the ladder. 

I watched in horror as my own head popped into frame, waddling up the stairs, completely oblivious, as I searched through box after box for a stupid Halloween costume. 

The video then abruptly ended, right before the black widow came crawling out from under the package causing me to jump backwards and fall. 

The next cut was a shot of my living room. It showed the camera slowly approaching the tape that lay on my coffee table. 

Another sudden cut. 

A hand was now in frame, pale and decrepit. It carefully placed my silver spaghetti pot atop the kitchen counter before patting it softly, then panning the camera around the room to reveal the mess that had been created. 

The next and final cut revealed me, yet again, cautiously searching the addict with a flashlight. Eyes wide and apprehension painted clearly across my face. 


I stared at the television in absolute dismay. Frozen. My jaw dropped cleanly to the floor. 

I remained in a trance-like state for the remainder of the footage, broken only when the video abruptly ended, and was somehow replaced by live footage. 

Live footage that showed a 22 year old man, who lives alone, sitting in awe, as he watched himself on the television. 

My mind took longer than I care to admit for it to put the pieces together, but once it did, it was too late, and the sound of heavy footsteps began echoing from the television, and the live footage inched closer and closer to my spot on the sofa.

I’m writing this here now because I’m not sure when I’ll get another chance. I’m not sure I’ll live long enough to recount this event in its entirety. 

My name is Donavin Meeks. I’m 22 years old, and last month, I found a VHS tape. 

I had been rummaging through my attic, searching for some old Halloween costumes I could pull back out for old times' sake, just to get into the ol’ holiday spirit. 

I’ll preface by saying, much like many others, my attic was almost backroom-ish. 

The way the dust had collected amongst the clutter, and how the cobwebs seemed to decorate the beams that supported my roof, the atmosphere alone was unsettling enough. 

As I searched through box after box of old knick-knacks, photo albums, and stocking stuffers that nobody used anymore, I finally managed to find the cardboard box labeled “Halloween” with a little cutely drawn spider with a smiley face beside it. 

All hail the Gods of irony, because as soon as I lifted the box, the biggest black widow I’d ever seen came running out, its legs clicking against the hardwood.

I *hate* spiders, so this obviously caused me to jump backwards, tripping and falling over some other boxes and immediately flailing like a maniac in fear of a bite from the arachnid. 

Hopping to my feet and checking ferociously for any sign of the thing on any part of my body, I happened to glance down at the mess of boxes I had just created. 

Lying in the center of the scattered clothing and Christmas decorations, lie a VHS tape. 

Unlike the other items, the VHS tape was completely dust free, and seemed as though it had been watched to about the halfway point. 

I picked it up to analyze it and found that it had been labeled “Do Not Watch” in black permanent marker over white painters tape. 

Staring at the words, I couldn’t help but feel utter intrigue. 

Not only had I never seen the tape, I had never even OWNED a VHS player. 

I mean, I’m 22, honestly, what am I going to use one of those things for? 

The dams of curiosity broke within the first two minutes of my discovery, and off I went, down to the local pawn shop to find my VHS player. 

It cost me a solid $5.98. One of the perks of being obsolete, I guess. 
Upon returning home, I was bewildered to find that the mysterious videotape was no longer on the coffee table where I had left it. 

Living alone, this turned out to be incredibly concerning to me. 

I began to rack my brain, thinking of how I could have misplaced the thing. 

I distinctly remembered placing it directly in the center of my coffee table. I mean, I checked under the couches, on the dining room table, my bedroom, bathroom, every room in my house had been checked. 

I began thinking that it was my mind that had been lost instead of that damn tape. 

I stayed up into the early morning hours because the idea of something that distinct just vanishing like that; it irked me. 

My mind already tends to wander and teeter on borderline paranoid schizophrenia, and this event did NOT help. 

Once I finally DID choose to go to bed, my sleep was shakey at best. 

I couldn’t have been asleep for more than an hour and a half when the abrupt sounds of what seemed to be footsteps awoke me. 

I could have swore that I heard the sound coming from directly above me, yet, once I fully regained consciousness, they had stopped completely. 

I had first put it off as a dream, a mere trick of the mind, similar that feeling you get when you’re falling in your sleep. 

That thought gave me comfort, and allowed me to doze back into sleep. However, that comfort was quickly vanquished when the same sounds started up yet again. 

This time I KNEW what I had heard, and I wasn’t about to just lay in bed defenseless. 

I immediately threw the covers off of myself and grabbed the bat that I keep beside my bed in case of home intruders just like this one. 

Being sure to make a lot of noise so the intruder KNEW that I was coming. I wanted them afraid, I wanted them to feel what I had been feeling. 

I yanked the attic door down and began climbing the ladder, flashlight in one hand, bat in the other. 

I hyped myself up as I ascended, preparing myself for whatever may lay within the plane of darkness which is my attic. 

Once I got about 6 inches from the entrance, I called out. 

“I know you’re up there! I hope you know I’m calling the cops, AND I’m armed. So just come on out please. Don’t make this any harder than it needs to be.” 

I waited a few moments and received no response. 

The silence was daunting, and cut through me.

The hot attic air seemed to grow chilled. A distinct drop in temperature that made me shiver. 

“Just come on out, man. We can work this out just as soon as you come out and make yourself known!” 

I waited a few moments once more, and once more, received no response. 

“Alright, I’m coming up! I swear to God if I see any movement whatsoever from you, I am bashing your head in!” 

I slowly began to ascend what remained of the ladder. 

My right palm sweat profusely wrapped around the rubber grip of the bat, whereas my left hand shook the beam of the flashlight ever so slightly. 

I began to scan the room with the beam, making sure light touched every surface possible from the attic entrance. 

Everything seemed still. Calm. Untouched, if it weren’t for where the few boxes I had knocked over prior. 

Though my light landed on no one, it did happen to fall upon a familiar plastic black rectangle, placed right back in the center of the spilled clutter. 

“No fucking way…” I thought to myself. 

Cautiously, I made my way towards the VHS tape, practically spinning in circles with my flashlight as I inched closer. 

Still, no sign of an intruder. 

I reached down and retrieved the VHS tape. 

Just then, a whole wall of boxes came tumbling over from across the attic, followed by the sounds of swift footsteps that seemed to approach me at an inhuman pace, only to completely dissipate as soon as it was before me. 

The flashlight and bat were both shaking wildly now as I spun around the room, sweating and petrified. 

“COME OUT! COME OUT RIGHT NOW!” I screamed. 

The attic was now eerily silent again. 

As I stood there, shaking and on the brink of a panic attack, the sound of creaking floorboards scratched the back of my mind, and a deep, booming voice spoke from behind me. 

“Boo.” 

I flew across the attic at a speed I didn’t know I was possible of achieving, 

I was down the ladder so fast that my foot ended up getting caught on the last rung, causing my ankle to twist, followed by a sickening POP that shot pain throughout my entire leg. 

I had saved my videotape though, and this time, it wasn’t leaving my side. 

I ended up having to spend the rest of the night and next morning in the hospital getting x-rayed and having my foot casted up. 

I had ended up breaking my ankle, and all I could tell the doctors was I tripped while climbing out of the attic. 

Anyway, I returned home as soon as I was cleared, anxious to finally watch this VHS that seemed to had randomly appeared in my home, as well as some sort of unwanted visitor. 

I never really fed into the whole paranormal thing, but holy shit, man. The true horror that I felt in that moment up in that attic; it made me a believer instantly. 

Well, I should say that it made me believe that things can be ATTACHED to objects. Whether it be holy or demonic. Attachments can happen. 

And I believe that’s what the case was with this tape. 

Once I arrived home, I was determined to finally view its contents.  

Something that I had failed to notice upon retrieving the tape from the attic was that now, instead of being half way through, it was completely rewound to the very beginning. 

Not only that, but the black marker had now been turned…red? It looked as though a completely new label had been placed on the tape. It looked…flashier. Like the *CAUTION* tag on a bottle of chemicals.

1p4yjb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1p4yjb2/need_advice/,Need Advice,"So my lady recently has been diagnosed with POTS,  she’s 28 and had a job and was happy and well I know it sucks having POTS. It affects everybody around you differently like for me I know I gotta do my part and than some cause she cant right now. I don’t mind doing the extra work or even having to change our lifestyle slightly whatevs. My thing is I just miss her smiling all the time, being happy. Shits just dumb, anyway she’s been a little more miserable lately and had a breakdown the other day cause she’s tired of just feeling drained and her rate being whack and all the other stuff. Just makes me sad not seeing my lady lit up and happy but I just need advice from anyone and everyone on what I can do to help her. Whether it’s to just make her life more comfy or snacks or whatever helps ppl with POTS to just idk feel better mentally I guess. She used to be active and now just making a cup of coffee will make her tired. I’m sorry this post was long but if anyone has any advice it’d be much appreciated.

1p4yivb,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSCCruises/comments/1p4yivb/aurea_experience_is_not_worth_it/,Aurea Experience is NOT worth it.,"We just finished our 1st MSC cruise on the MSC Meraviglia.  I have a lot of thoughts, but I'll limit this to just the Aurea Experience.  We paid about $540 extra.  In retrospect, I don't think we got our money's worth.

First off, the priority boarding wasn't much to talk about.  We arrived at the pier around 10:30 am, and stood in the same line as everyone else to get through security.  We did not see any sort of luggage service for Aurea guests.  If it existed, we didn't see any indication of special luggage service.  Once we got through security, we got in the priority line, which was a lot shorted than the main queue.  The problem was... we only had 4 or 5 booths for check in, whereas the normal queue had over 20 booths.  So the lines actually moved at the about the same pace.  The people we were next to during the security check-in ended up getting to their booth as we were leaving our check in... so we maybe saved about 5 minutes in the priority line?

Getting room service for free was not enticing... the food options were very limited (no burgers, fries, grilled cheese, etc) and the cost for the food was about $5 each.  So offering free deliver wasn't enough to overcome the high food cost.

Access to the thermal area was a bit tough... most of the times were booked already, and it wasn't available each day.  I've been on other cruises where you can come and go without appointments, and that is much more appealing.  Knowing on Sunday whether or not you'll want to spend an hour in the sauna on Friday is not realistic.

We don't drink champaign (or prosecco) but that's on us... others might like that.

Access to the Solarium deck area was a huge disappointment.  There are no amenities up there... just the hot tub and chairs.  While in New York, as well as days 2 and 7, it was too cold and windy to be up there.  We were hoping it would be something akin to Richard's Rooftop (on Virgin Voyages) but it was nothing even remotely like that.  Even if there was a bar up there, it would be at least something.  This was a big letdown.

We noticed that employees were selling the Aurea Experience on board on the 1st day.  Not sure how good that would be for getting the premium rooms.  We bought our cruise fairly late, so there were only about 6 balcony rooms available anyway, so having the ability to pick the premium locations was lost on us.  Plus, a balcony is a balcony, for the most part. So I don't see a big value in 'choosing the best room locations'.

The slippers and robes were a nice touch, but our room attendant did not have any pillow options for us to choose from.  He just said they don't have any other pillows.  So I'm not sure where we got that info mixed up.  

Last thing... if you are researching online for the Aurea Experience, be careful... there is a lot of incorrect information floating around.  MSCs webpage is correct, but there were several other blog and cruise critics that said the Aurea Experience included upgraded bedding options (it does not), a coffee maker in the room (it does not), and free room service (only the delivery is free). 

All things said... I don't think we got $540 worth of benefits for the Aurea Experience.  I'm not even sure we got $100.  I understand that if we'd upgraded to the Aurea Suite, we would have seen a lot of improvement on the amenities.  But the 'experience' wasn't much of an experience.  I do not recommend.",3,1763933324.0,MSCCruises,6,0.67,False

1p4yhqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfpublish/comments/1p4yhqp/working_on_marketing_for_my_ongoing_selfpublished/,Working on marketing for my on-going self-published serial. Looking for advice!,"So I have a superhero series being published online on a few websites: Substack, ScribbleHub, Inkitt, and AO3. I only ever push the Substack link (I like the ""look"" of it best on there), but really only get my friends to click it. ScribbleHub, I have 10 readers. Inkitt, I can't tell, I don't have enough data to pull that information (oof), so I'm imagining it's extremely low if not zero. AO3 has given me nothing. I'm interested in expanding to Fictionate, but the site is not working for me so I'm wondering if it's even active.

To be up front and to be clear, I'm okay with low readership and wasn't expecting much of anything. I feel happy with the ScribbleHub numbers, but I figure I'd like to work on my marketing game and use this book as an experiment with it. 

My audience, I think is people in their 20s-30s who lean left. It's an anarchic, abolitionist take on the superhero formula, and I want people who are into that. BlueSky feels like a great social media site for spreading the word about this, but I don't have a following and my cover art isn't especially great. It's hard to advertise books compared to visual art on social media it seems.

I have my one idea of flyering some local book stores, coffee shops, and libraries, advertising my book as a local read. I think that'd be cute, thinking about doing it the week after Thanksgiving. I'm going to be posting all the way until May with my current release schedule of 1 chapter a week, so I'm not necessarily in a rush. I also want to make some business cards while I'm at it that have a QR code to the first chapter on Substack. 

I'm broke. I know some of marketing involves investing, and I can't afford to do that right now, despite how important this book is to me. So IDK - I was hoping to bounce ideas off folks and see what people think of this situation. Happy to answer more questions to give a better picture of what exactly is going on here. 

Also coming clean on this - I've been doing ""content creation"" since I was 12. 20 years later, I've made at least a hundred YouTube videos and I've written over 100 fics. I am in fact - pretty talented at this point. I know what I make is good, but I have always struggled with pulling an audience. My work tends to be niche and very specific, and I've yet to find that niche audience that will love what I do.",1,1763933249.0,selfpublish,3,1.0,False

I want to know the grind size in clicks. 

Eg. 16-24 is recommended for espresso ( for the Cothas arabica medium roast at 16 clicks 18 gms the machine is choking and at 24 it goes upto 32 secs of extraction. Around 20 seems to be the sweet spot but it tastes bitter.  So I want to change my bean and adjust and learn more. ) 

So for whatever coffee you use can you tell me the click number.

2 years ago you contacted me because you wanted to get together so you could apologize. I accepted, 14 months later you are telling me to get my things out of your house that you insisted I bring because it would be easier when I stay the night.

I'll never forget months after the apology coffee you said ""I was almost 100% sure after I apologized to you that would be the last time I see you""

If I had cared a bit more about myself it should have been.

You used me, just admit it, I was useful to you when you were recovering from what your last bf did. I was comfortable, familiar, warm and the sex, well you already know about the sex. The part where I was not honest enough was after all the f'd up shit you did. I Still only wanted YOU, I wanted to commit to YOU. But I lied about it, I said let's be nonchalant friends with benefits, and you suggested being exclusive, I agreed and that was easy because I only wanted you anyways. I am sure you knew, parts of you wanted to meet there, other parts couldn't figure out how I fit into your life. You started rejecting parts of me that weren't as useful to your comfort and recovery.

I bought you that ring that you found from our past life. You seemed to really cherish it, it made me happy how happy the ring made you.

then after 14 months of ""dating not dating"" (being a regular and important part of each others life) you did what you always do. You question everything, you push me away, you get sick and depressed, and I feel betrayed and rejected because it always seems to come out of no where. You told me 2 days before that phone call to grab you a shirt from where we got our matching tattoo. I never told you but I did.

as days and weeks past you never fully let go, you said you wanted to be friends even though you KNOW we couldn't be. You still messaged occasionally, and looked at all my stories. It was torture for me, so I told you no contact for 90 days. It was a good choice for my own mental health. But I counted those days, every one  of them. On day 90 I was going to reach out to you until I saw your profile pic of you and your new bf. classic you, taking little to no time to yourself to heal, jumping into the next relationship. That was a full circle moment for me. I felt like such a Cuck loser idiot for letting you back in my life and investing so much of my heart into you.

and here we are we haven spoken or seen each other in over 2 years despite living in the same town. Most of the intense emotions have worn off. You got married again, I got married again, you are with child. I will never have anymore kids.

and I am on reddit telling the void; that after all we have been through together and  apart after all the hurt and betrayal and passion and pleasure and pain. I still love you, I  still care about you, I still want to see you and hear about what is going on in your life and it makes absolutely no sense that I feel these things for you, but I do none the less. I am not an idiot anymore, I am emotionally stable.

Hey everyone,

I've been on a major journey to stop feeling so drained and scattered all the time. After a ton of trial and error, I’ve landed on a few simple, daily habits that have been absolute game-changers for my energy, focus, and general mood.

Thought I'd share what's been working for me, in case it helps anyone else feeling stuck in a rut. These aren't massive, life-altering changes, but tiny shifts that add up to a huge difference.

**⚡ For ENERGY:**

*   **The First 10 Minutes Rule.** Instead of grabbing my phone first thing, I chug a glass of water and stand by a window for a few minutes of natural light. It sounds ridiculously simple, but it wakes up my brain and body in a way coffee can't. No more zombie-shuffling to the kitchen.

*   **Movement Snacks.** The idea of a full hour at the gym can feel daunting. So, I do ""movement snacks."" A 5-minute stretch, a quick walk around the block between meetings, 10 push-ups while waiting for the kettle to boil. It breaks up the stagnancy and gives me a quick jolt of energy.

**🎯 For FOCUS:**

*   **The ""One Thing"" To-Do List.** My old to-do lists were a novel of everything I *could* do. Now, each morning I write down the **one** most important thing that needs to get done. Everything else is a bonus. This single-task focus is wild – no more decision fatigue, just clear direction.

*   **""Monk Mode"" Blocks.** I block out 60-90 minute chunks in my calendar where I turn my phone on silent and put it in another room. I close all unnecessary browser tabs. It's tough at first, but the amount of deep work you can get done is insane.

**😊 For HAPPINESS:**

*   **Acknowledge The Small Wins.** Did I finally clear out that one annoying email? *Win.* Did I make a healthy lunch instead of ordering out? *Win.* I started mentally high-fiving myself for these tiny accomplishments, and it genuinely boosts my mood and motivation.

*   **The ""What Went Right?"" Journal.** Before bed, instead of ruminating on what went wrong, I jot down three things that went *right* that day. Even on a bad day, there's always something: a good cup of coffee, a funny text from a friend, a song I enjoyed. It actively rewires your brain to look for the positive.

Honestly, the biggest battle is often the one in our own head. While these habits are amazing for the day-to-day, sorting through the mental and emotional side of things can be the toughest part. For anyone who needs a more structured way to tackle that, I found a lot of clarity using **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)**. It helped me map things out when I felt overwhelmed.

It's all about building momentum with small, consistent actions.

Would love to hear from you all! What are your non-negotiable daily habits that keep you feeling your best?",1,1763933086.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1p4yd3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/1p4yd3c/the_dating_scene_here_has_been_rough_curious_if/,The dating scene here has been rough — curious if others feel the same.,"Just needed to vent and get some perspective from people here.

I’ve been in Charlotte a while now, and dating has been… brutal. A few examples just to show the pattern:

* Girl #1 (Hinge): First and second dates went great. Then she disappeared without a word.
* Girl #2 (Hinge): Bailed on the first date, ghosted, came back asking to meet again, then bailed and blocked me on everything. For no reason what so ever.
* Girl #3 (gym): Gave me her number at the gym, said she wanted to grab coffee, then ghosted.
* Girl #4 (Hinge/gym): We matched she ghosted after good conversation, realized we go to the same gym, had a good conversation in person — then she ghosted again after giving me her number and said she wanted to meet for coffee
* Girl #5 (gym): Took weeks to pick a day, finally settled on one, and canceled a few hours before.

And honestly this is just the highlight reel. I’ve probably matched with 50+ women here, and the majority either vanish mid-conversation or text something like, “Sorry, been so busy and I don't have my notifications on, here is my number,” then disappear again.

It’s gotten discouraging. I don’t know if it’s the culture here, the apps, timing, or just bad luck on my end.

I’m moving next summer and honestly cannot wait. I've been living here for about a year and I’m genuinely curious — is this just *Charlotte dating* right now? Or have I just hit an unlucky streak?

Sometimes I feel like because I'm not Christian and because I'm not in run clubs with other people in finance here, it's like, I feel like I'm not even worth their time. Its almost like, ""Hey! Unless you go to the same Strava/Run Club/Church as I do. Then I don't want to go on a date with you"".

It feels so formal and forced for two strangers to sit across from each other for a full meal. It’s like too much too soon and the vibe always feels a little inorganic. I only realized this years later, but I’m honestly starting to prefer casual first dates like grabbing a quick coffee or meeting up briefly during a night out with friends.

A lot of my friends say coffee is too casual and means a guy isn’t serious, but I don’t agree anymore. I think a man’s seriousness and intentions show over time, not in the format of the first date. If he’s genuinely interested, his actions will naturally increase as the connection grows.

I hope you're all doing well. This is sort of a PSA and reminder to everyone who plays this game, new and old.

Often times we get into conversation where it all boils down to ""What is the best"", be it the best ship, best weapons, best gear, etc.

best best best, that's all we really talk about, what is the Meta and driving towards that.

As someone who's worked in the video game industry for 12 years, I urge, plead, beg you all, stop making this your end all be all in a conversation.

The short of the long is, this game is still in Alpha, what is Meta now, will likely not be meta when 1.0 goes live.

I urge you to look at the things you purchase in-game or on the Pledge store in a manner that reflects what YOU want to get out of Star Citizen.

Does a ship look cool to you? Great! Go for that one  
Are you looking for a light fighter, but don't really want the Meta ship for whatever reason? Great! which one DO you like? Get that one.

Everything in this game is subject to change.  
The more you make something sacred, especially something currently Meta, the more upset you're going to be when balance passes happen.

So just play the game the way you want to play, fly the things you want to fly, do the industrial loops you want to do.

Its not Meta. Who cares  
It doesn't make the most money. Who cares

***Find YOUR fun.***

Cookies and coffee are on the back table for those who stayed.

All the best,

Last week, our team had a late-night deadline. Just me and one colleague — someone I’ve always admired quietly. She’s confident in a very calm way, the kind that makes the whole room feel lighter. We were never exactly close, just friendly enough to share coffee breaks and complain about Monday mornings.

The night stretched longer than expected. Everyone else had left hours earlier. It was just us, laptops glowing, the office unusually silent. Around 1:40 AM, the building power tripped for a few seconds — everything went dark except the emergency lights.

She laughed, nervously, and said, “Why do these things happen only when we’re alone?”

I don’t know what shifted in that moment. Maybe it was the exhaustion. Maybe it was months of unspoken chemistry. But the atmosphere changed. She sat next to me instead of across the table. Our conversation drifted from work into life… and then into things we’d never shared with anyone at work.

At one point, she told me,
“You always pretend you’re okay. But you’re the kind of person who carries everything alone, aren’t you?”

No one had ever said something like that to me. Not with that kind of softness.

I don’t know who leaned in first. But the space between us disappeared so naturally, so quietly, that it felt like it was always supposed to happen. It wasn’t reckless or wild — just intensely… real. Like something we’d both been avoiding for too long.

Nothing explicit happened — just closeness way beyond what colleagues should share. Her head on my chest. My hand in her hair. Her whispering things I’m still thinking about.

When the lights came back, we moved away instantly, like reality had just walked back into the room.

We didn’t speak about it afterwards. Not a word.

This week she’s kept things… normal. A little too normal. Like she’s trying to erase that night by pretending it never happened.

And I’m stuck between wanting to respect her space… and wanting to relive that moment again.

I don’t know if I crossed a line.
I don’t know if she regrets it.
I don’t know what this means now.

But it’s been a week and I can’t stop thinking about her.
About us.
About that silence before the lights came back on.

I don’t know what I’m expecting by writing this — maybe just a perspective I can’t give myself.

Should I bring it up? Or let it fade?

Inflation is up because of the service economy and services. So that has nothing to do with tariffs,” Bessent said.

Welker had [pointed to data](https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm) from the consumer price index (CPI) showing inflation at 3 percent in September, up from 2.3 percent in April, before Trump’s tariffs took effect.

“And many of the food items where the inflation is coming down, the USTR \[U.S. Trade Representative\] has been working very hard on trade deals. And the trade deals that have been in the works for six or eight months coincide with many Latin America, Central American countries, where the foodstuffs you just named come from,” he continued.

Bessent had earlier insisted “inflation hasn’t gone up,” adding, “We have slowed inflation. And we are working very hard to bring it down.”

Trump [signed an executive order earlier this month](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5606876-trump-cuts-tariffs-grocery/) cutting tariffs on scores of products in a bid to lower some grocery prices.

Union soldiers were dying. Not from bullets. From dysentery, scurvy, and typhoid.  
  
The military diet: Hardtack, beans, coffee. Minimal meat due to cost.  
  
Salisbury observed: Soldiers with access to beef recovered faster from everything. Wounds healed quicker. Infections cleared. Energy returned.  
  
He started prescribing pure beef. Three times daily. Nothing else.  
  
The results were so dramatic that officers started requisitioning beef specifically for sick soldiers.  
  
Salisbury published his findings in 1888: ""The Relation of Alimentation and Disease.""  
  
His conclusion: Most chronic diseases stem from improper fermentation in the digestive system caused by eating starches and vegetables.  
  
His prescription: Minced beef, three times daily, with hot water. For weeks or months depending on severity.  
  
He documented successful treatment of:  
\- Tuberculosis  
\- Rheumatism  
\- Mental disorders  
\- Digestive diseases  
\- Obesity  
\- Gout  
  
His work was hugely influential. Salisbury steak was named after him. Originally it wasn't a convenience food. It was medicine.  
  
By 1920s: Pharmaceutical companies developing antibiotics and drugs for the same conditions.  
  
By 1950s: Salisbury's work is ignored, mocked, or forgotten.  
  
Today: ""Salisbury steak"" is a processed meat patty with gravy served in school cafeterias. The medical application has been completely erased from history.  
  
A physician who cured chronic diseases with beef was memory-holed because his cure couldn't be patented.  
  
The pharmaceutical industry didn't just compete with his methods. They erased them from medical history entirely.

1p4y3yh,https://www.reddit.com/r/christiandatingadvice/comments/1p4y3yh/update_he_does_like_me/,UPDATE: he does like me,"Reposting because of an update at the end!!

I (26F) started to have feelings for my guy friend (21M)  who I serve with at my church. We’ll call him Johnny. I was originally waiting for my feelings to die out and chalked it up to just a crush.

However, Johnny and I hung out with a bunch of church friends and I felt like he was flirting with me. Johnny would always look at me when the whole group would erupt in laughter. I would catch him staring at me and he'd quickly look away. When Johnny shared stories in the group, he looked at me only, almost as if he was talking only to me. Even if I looked away when I looked back, Johnny was staring at me.

Johnny would also look at me and smile whenever romantic songs came on while everyone was doing their own thing. I, again, felt like oh maybe this is just in my head.

But at a different time, I was giving my feelings to the Lord and surrendering it to Him. I was praying and said ""God, if Johnny’s a distraction take him away, but if he's not..."" and I opened my eyes and 100 feet away, Johnny was walking right towards me but he was staring at the ground.

I (maybe prematurely) took this as a sign. The whole situation got me back into the word because I didn't want to make an idol out of my friend.

I told several friends about my experience and they also thought it was confirmation or at the very least really crazy.

I, of course, started over analyzing our interactions and I hated it. I was being weird towards Johnny because I was nervous but he was also being weird. We went on a church trip and I felt like he was ignoring me. At times though, he would walk over and stand right next to me and not say anything.

When we came back from the trip, Johnny was still ignoring me and every time he saw me, he looked like a deer in the headlights. I was so sick of thinking about him all the time (again not wanting to make him an idol) and things being weird between us because he IS my friend and I've always loved and cared for him in a platonic way.I told God if Johnny was going to keep me from Him, I didn’t want anything with him.

I decided to text him (we don't do that lol) and said I was sorry I was being weird lately and asked if he wanted to get coffee and just talk. He said yes.

I was planning on just telling Johnny how I felt in order to be transparent with him and wanting to end the weirdness I was feeling. I wanted our dynamic to go back to normal. I wanted my friend back. Day of, it felt very date–like, but I knew it could all be in my head. Johnny bought me coffee and we talked forever about the church trip, our testimonies, how we got to this point in our lives, our childhoods, our hopes and dreams etc. etc.

About 45 minutes in, Johnny asked me why I asked him to talk. He gave me this smirk when he asked me and I immediately panicked. The whole point of meeting up with him was to tell him how I felt and control how I said it (to make me more comfortable), but his question caught me off guard and I stumbled on my words and said “I don’t know” He said “okay” and we said it back to each other both times. 

The awkwardness pissed me off and he finally said “well in your text you said you were feeling weird” and I ended up telling how I was being weird and he was being weird. He said “ I was benign weird!?” and I said yeah I felt like he wouldn’t talk to me or was ignoring me. He said he wasn’t trying to and everytime he saw me I was hanging out with girls so he just didn’t come up to me. He said he was sorry and originally thought I asked to talk to him because he thought he had offended me. 

I told him we were cool and we ended on a good note. We had a church event later and I reminded him he was serving that evening and he should probably leave now to be there early (he’s required to be early). He looked at his watch and said he had five minutes. He looked at me as if he wanted to keep talking. I told him he should get going and I got up to leave. He asked me what I was doing before the event started and I said I would hang around the church until it started. 

I left in a rush, pissed off that I didn’t get my task done. The secret of my crush was eating me alive and I knew I wouldn’t get over it until I got it out in the open. 

At the event, I later felt like the Lord was telling me to tell Johnny how I felt. I know you are not supposed to test God and I had a problem with it a year ago. However, I was still going back and forth. Johnny would smile at me from across the room and I finally asked God for multiple blatant confirmations (7). 

I finally decided to write him a note and give it to him at the end of the night since I couldn’t say it. I put the note in my bible and immediately felt like the Lord was telling me to put it in my pocket so I was more likely to give it to him. By the end of the night, I couldn’t find him and I told God, “I’m not about to chase down this boy. If I don’t see him before I go, I’m not giving it to him” I walked toward the parking lot and I saw him. He asked me if I was leaving and he went to give me a big bear hug (we’ve never done that) and of course I panicked because I was planning on dabbing him up and leaving the note in his hand. I finally put the note in his hand. He asked what it was and I told him to read it later and I ran away.

I drove home with my heart in my stomach, pissed off that I was so vulnerable. However, I felt a supernatural level of peace. I had never felt so content and I knew it was from God. However, I did feel a bit confused about the outcome of what this was all for. I told God if I walk through this store and see merchandise for a movie me and Johnny watched together then these feelings I had for Johnny were leading to a relationship. (the movie was really old, I wasn’t asking for something like Wicked while there’s all this promo lol). I walked around the store looking for the crafts I intended on buying. I saw a random merch item from the movie. I brushed it off as a coincidence though.

I was about to leave the store and I saw another type of movie merch but it was a picnic blanket this time. I had written a poem about me and Johnny on a picnic blanket as soon as I had feelings for him, so naturally I took this as confirmation. I felt like it was too spot on to be nothing. 

I later had dinner with a friend of mine and I told her about what I was experiencing. She said it was crazy and asked for the first confirmation I ever asked for about Johnny.

I had to think about it and I remember MONTHS ago before I ever had feelings for Johnny. I had asked for confirmation. 

It was one of the first times I had ever hung out with this guy, before we were even friends. We had this weirdly romantic moment while serving and we gave each other this weird, loving smile of contentment. I remember praying “God, if this is supposed to be my husband, let me have feelings for him” I had asked God this because it felt like a romantic moment but at the time I wasn’t attracted to this guy AT ALL. (he’s the exact opposite of my type lol) 

Now, having dinner with my friend, I remembered this and told her. She was shocked and we didn’t know what to say of any of it. We just both decided it was all crazy. Later that night, I asked the Lord why Johnny hadn’t responded. Not out of desperation, just curiosity ( not like me at all lol), I felt like the Holy Spirit was telling me “you know he hates texting, and he’s afraid of his feelings.” I accepted this and went to bed. 

4 days after I had given Johnny the note, it was Sunday and he wasn’t at church, which was odd cause he serves in multiple ways on Sunday and is always doing something. I hung out for a couple services because I felt like the Lord was telling me to stay and serve for the children's ministry since we had new programming starting that week and the director needed help. 

I ended up seeing Johnny before I left and again he looked like a deer in the headlights. I realized “yeah, he definitely read my note” and I wasn’t ready to deal with any of it. He was in a group of friends so I just left and ended up getting lunch with some other church friends. We saw each other a couple times before I left and made awkward eye contact but we didn't say hi or anything. 

That night, we had another church event. I figured Johnny wasn’t serving since he was mostly absent at morning service. I was already on the calendar to serve and I saw him when I showed up. I was so annoyed and didn’t want to have any feelings for him anymore. I hated the whole situation. We spoke in groups but didn’t really talk one on one. 

At the end of the night, I was talking to a gal friend of mine. Johnny came over and asked to speak with me outside. I felt like throwing up. I was hopeful but also disappointed. I realized my own feelings about the situation were complicated. I wanted my feelings to be reciprocated and I also wanted him to turn me down. It was really odd. 

He ended up rejecting me and was really kind about it. He said the whole situation was new to him and he’s never had to do this before. Johnny said he wasn’t interested. I took this mostly well. I wasn’t completely upset (no one likes to get rejected tho lol) and I was mostly just confused. With God and Johnny. Also what was this all for?

I went home and told my besties and my mom. I realized that I was experiencing limerence and infatuation and wasn’t seeing Johnny completely how he was. I was over romanticizing him in my head. I was laughing at myself for ever having feelings for him. 

A few days later, I was hanging out with church friends and Johnny came last minute. When I saw him, I realized I still had a mini crush on him or maybe I was nervous because he thought I still had a crush on him. For once, I had no idea what I was feeling or what was happening to me internally. 

Things weren’t weird though. We had conversations amongst the whole group and privately. I also felt like Johnny was giving flirty vibes to a really close gal friend of mine (we’ll call her Sally) and the possibility of them becoming a relationship didn’t bother me. I considered myself over this whole thing.

I felt better and the next day I was fine and really started to see Johnny as my brother in christ again. All of his little quirks were still cute but in an admirable way, not romantic. The same way I find my gal friends cute with their little quirks. 

THEN, I saw Johnny a day later. I felt nervous and my heart played hopscotch in my chest. I panicked. WHAT THE HECK? I thought I was over this. He was being coy around me when I was talking to other people. When I was hanging out with guy friends, he would interrupt or try to talk to me. I was annoyed so I tried to ignore him. 

By the end of the night, I was secretly hoping he’d come around me and we could just talk and joke. I hated it and wanted to resent him, but I just couldn't. I still cared so much about him. I was talking with some gal friends and he came over and looked me dead in the eyes while someone was talking. I darted my eyes away and was annoyed by the attention. He started joking with one of my friends and we all started laughing. He kept looking at me and I’d catch him looking at me. I was so pissed. I felt so vulnerable and like he just enjoyed that I liked him as opposed to him liking me back. I felt vulnerable and still couldn’t hate him, which pissed me off even more. I wanted to hate him and see him as a jerk but I just couldn’t.

Johnny left the room and I prayed, “God, if this whole thing isn’t over. If there is something here and if the door isn’t closed, have him come back into the room” He did. I was confused again.

I told myself the author of confusion is the enemy, but it could also be my flawed flesh. I was annoyed again. A bunch of friends stayed longer to play basketball. Sally was going to play and I thought oh maybe he likes her. But Johnny said I should join. Mind you, I’m completely anti-sports and am painfully uncoordinated. I was gonna leave but I liked hanging out with my friends. I also felt like the Lord was telling me to stay as much as I like to run away from things like this. So I did. 

I hung out with another gal friend in the bleachers while everyone else played basketball. We had microphones and were reciting the score and giving a play by play, joking around. Johnny ended up calling a time out and looked at us to announce it. When he got my attention, he darted his eyes away immediately looking flustered. But I knew I could be overthinking it and trying to see what I wanted at that moment. The friend I was cheering with left and I decided to go to even though i wanted to hang out around Johnny. I knew this time, it was my own emotions and not the Lord. I left and prayed in the car home asking God to take away my emotions.

I woke up this morning and he still is taking over my mind. I’m so done and want to be done with it. Amongst all of this, I still love and care for Johnny and admire him deeply. It pisses me off. I’m past hate, I want to feel indifferent towards him but I can’t.

I’ve given up trying to predict the future and I want to be with someone who knows they want to be with me. BUT as I delusional for thinking Johnny liked me in the first place? I am usually able to read people and it really bothers me that I got this really wrong.

Let me know what you think. Any advice or comments are welcome. Please just be kind.

UPDATE:

Johnny pulled me aside during a Friendsgiving dinner to talk. He told me he does have feelings for me but he’s scared because he’s never dated anyone. He said he was flirting with me before but he never expected me to feel the same way so he panicked. He said he wants to take things really slow. I told him I need a few days to think about it but honestly I’m so over all the back and forth. What should I do?",1,1763932327.0,christiandatingadvice,0,1.0,False

I knew it would take some tuning and adjusting, and I am not aiming to get replicas of what the Nespresso machine was producing.

I have the machine for less than 1 week, I bought Waitrose Italian style arabica beans (med/dark roast) to try. I wanted to try union natural spirit but couldn't find a 200g pack on the shelf.

The espresso is watery and (from what I perceive) weak in caffeine. Its colour is not a rich black, but a bit transparent and the foam is quite on the yellow side, not that richer brown.

I have been changing the grinder to grind more finely and I'm already at 3 (the scale goes drom 7 to 1 in 0.5 steps where a lower number is a finer grind). I have taken at least 2 coffees at each grinder level step. Seems to be improving but it is not quite there yet. I have also raised the water temp to 'high' but cannot tell a huge difference.

Can someone suggest why the espresso is watery? Is it the coffee beans? Is it that I need to grind more and more finely? What else can I do?

Thanks all in advance.",1,1763932210.0,superautomatic,3,1.0,False

All welcome. Im putting effort into this post, hoping that we connect more deeply upfront. 

Ive met many great long-lasting friends on here, and im hoping to find more :)

Disability, LGBTQIA+, BIPOC, and general minority friendly! If you aren't, then gtfo! 🚪 

-----------------------------------

         ::: I am Seeking... ::: 

Im seeking long-term friends, online or not, with some kind of regular communication (inc calls). I want video/voice calls, and meeting new friends irl would be awesome too! But, text here first. Let's take it easy, and enjoy ourselves 😌

I prefer **video calls over voice.**

I like both long and deep convos, and those everyday ""how are you?"", with those simple daily details.

**( OH , KY , IN area is where im at - southwest Ohio )**

BTW- I do not need ""chat buddies"", just ppl i click with who seek true friendship.

-----------------------------------

         ::: Personality :::
**I am...**
    >>> empathetic, passionate, silly goofy giggly, thoughtful, always trying to grow and learn, positive upbeat and optimistic, introspective, patient, inquisitive, complex, excitable, honest, open-minded, warm, loyal


         ::: Interests :::

I have a lot of interests that we may connect on, and if not, a positive attitude, a sense of humor, and your own passionate interests go a long way. 

- **Psychology** is my passion. Mental health, neurodivergencies, addiction, behavior, methods and theories, neurology, all of it. Dbt, cbt, psychoanalysis. Ive studied some of it, and I've lived a lot of it, too.
- **Spirituality** is also a passion of mine. My approach is very eclectic and open. I love all things mystical. If you are at all religious and/or spiritual, we will have tons to talk about! If you aren't, no worries :)
- **Nature**. Rock and fossil hunting 🪨 🦖. I love natural running water. I could sit in one spot in a river or creek for hours 💧 and insects are friends.
- **Arts and crafts.** I love to create. Im still learning though...everything I know so far is pretty basic. But, ive started zentangle drawings, i crochet, do macrame hemp jewlery, beaded and rock wire wrap jewlery, collages, and im in a ceramics class. I skip around 😅
- **Journaling.** Shadow work. Learning about myself.
- **Poetry.** Its been awhile since ive written. Share yours and inspire me?
- **Pets/Animals**. I currently have two dogs and one cat, but Ive had some different kinds of animals over the years. Do you have any?
- I play **billiards**, **corn hole**, **board games**, and/or **card games** weekly
- Im in an **improv** class and loving it. I need to watch more improv, any suggestions?
- I don't read much these days, but when i do its **non-fiction** about interests, or really random **comic books**. Or the **FF** comics.
- Trying to learn the **ukulele!** like i said, im a beginner at a lot of these things, but im learning day by day.

- **Other likes:** piercings, coffee, tea, waffle house, tootsie pops, turtles, **philosophy**, deep reflective and introspective convos, off-rail pedantic discussions, etymology is cool, **Buddism, Quakerism,** *anything mystical or supernatural*, **tarot**, divination, numerology, astrology, tats, incense and candles, *witchy stuff*, **pen-paling**, collections (got any?), entomology, puns/dad humor, also I want to learn ASL really bad but cant commit to it right now 


- **Media? Not really...** TV, movies, music, videos... it is ***not*** how I connect as a *foundation* for friendship. I need more, a lot more. However, I like rock, grunge, alt, punk, folk/indie, and some 80s and 00s pop. I watch family sitcoms and The Office. Futurama. AHS, Twilight Zone, and Black Mirror. ""Crazy Ex-Gf"" too. But i rarely watch anything.
Idc to watch movies much, either. But I like cult classics and B movies....and Marvel is pretty cool. TBC, I do like these things, just not as a foundation for friendship, or as starter convo.
I also have 0 interest in video games 😬

I **LOVE** silence 🏝

-----------------------------------

Im seeking platonic connections, but I am open to more potentially happening with a woman. I am pan-romantic and demi-sexual. To not be misleading, I am engaged to an enby and we practice ENM. Not looking for a triad or anything, and friendship is more important to me rn.

You dont have to make your intro this long! 😅 BUT *pretty please* put...
- age, gender, general location
- what we relate on
- some of your interests and hobbies 
- tell me something you like about yourself, so i know you read the post (get yourself that credit :). 

Thank you for your time and effort.

1p4y1hu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce_Men/comments/1p4y1hu/dating_fwb_wthe_ex/,Dating & FWB w/The Ex,"13 years together. Never so much as looked at another girl with interest. Never returned a flirty glance or did anything that would be considered remotely disrespectful to my wife. She did not match that energy, unfortunately. I forgave her and here we are today living separately for over a year, paperwork filed and simply waiting on the final divorce decree. 

Took months to get here, but basically my ex (39F) and I  (42M) are both on good terms and, I think, happy with everything on our respective ends. We tried going no contact, but it felt forced & unnecessary. We currently live separate lives and have a meaningless boundary around physical/sexual interactions that we consistently violate every 10 days or so, but aside from that, things are pretty normal. 

We hang out once a week (maybe sometimes twice if we are violating that BS boundary), usually meeting up at a coffee shop/bakery to catch up on what’s going on in our lives. Until now, it’s mostly been basic stuff (which friends we’ve hung out with, what was said, how we’re doing, etc…), but things are starting to get a bit complicated. 

I began online dating a few weeks ago, and things are going well. I’ve stayed the course as prescribed by many of you (focus on my health, counseling, new wardrobe, etc…) and as a 42yr old divorcee with a great career, no kids, no alimony or any real baggage except some minor debt that I should have erased in the next 8 months, the prospects have been surprisingly decent. 

Of course, I shared that I started dating with my ex since we live in a small town and it was likely that she (or a mutual friend) would see me out with someone else at some point anyway. Things really changed after that…my ex has been asking questions fairly consistently about my dating life and the frequency with which we hook up is now increasing beyond what’s reasonable, her texts/voice messages are absurdly spicy and we’re both just kinda rolling with it.

One morning this past week she brought me a coffee on her way to work (she does this occasionally - acts of service and all that…). I work from home and a new friend had stayed over and parked her vehicle in the covered spot for my condo (which my ex definitely noticed). Since then, we’ve had conversations about ground rules for stopping by and providing notice and she’s clearly not happy that other women are becoming a part of my life. 

Nothing has escalated to the point of exclusivity with the women I’ve dated, but it probably won’t be long until one of them does and, in that situation, I’m very clear on what to do and how to handle it…but until then, what’s my responsibility here?

I wouldn’t feel guilty if I were exploring possibilities with 2 random women, but I do still kinda feel guilty when it comes to my ex - and that bothers me… at the same time (yes, incredibly selfishly), I am enjoying the attention from her and the other women I’m dating (guess I’ll put this on the list for therapy 😅).

We don’t actually owe each other anything. I don’t ask or care about her dating life (she has a date tonight and I’m being supportive - even though I’d rather not be informed). She has taken an interest in my dating life and I answer her questions within reason. Until the situation pops up where I’d need to  clarify a change in official relationship status, I’m just not going to. I playing by the rules she set and I’m enjoying myself.

If I’m doing something wrong and not seeing it, please feel free to call me out. But I definitely don’t feel like I am (at the moment).",2,1763932158.0,Divorce_Men,7,1.0,False

I'm Alex Miller, and, as the title implies, if you see me, please put me down. Every night, ever since I went down to Louisiana and got my fortune told, I've turned into… Something, every night.

In the woman's exact words, (I think, the sleep deprivation is starting to take its toll), she said, “Oh no, child. Something will take over your body at night, be warned. Keep your distance from others, for their safety.”

Of course, I just laughed it off and went on with the rest of the trip with my friends. I wasn't laughing so much, however, once I woke up the next morning, covered in blood, gore and chunks of bone, and my friends were gone.

I didn't have any idea what happened for the first few nights, I just knew I had to get far away. Honestly, with how long I've had to deprive myself of sleep to keep that thing at bay, I don't even know how long ago that first night was. Could've been 2 weeks, could've been 2 years.

I'm here to tell you all of what I've done, or what I may have done, for the past 2 weeks.

About 2 weeks ago, I was slowly shambling up the stairs of a motel, praying I could lock myself into my room for the night before I fell asleep to at least give everyone else some form of safety.

I hadn't slept in 8 days, and I could feel sleep's gentle, terrifying call lulling me. With shaky hands, dropping the key multiple times, I opened the door, slipping inside, barely able to lock the door and bolt the chain before falling to my knees. I could feel the crack of my bones extending in my arms and fingers, the tearing of the flesh covering my shoulder blades as wings slowly extended from the holes in my flesh.

I fell to the floor, my eyes slipping closed as sleep took me under, my last thought being the hope that the door lock and chain would be enough. If you're gonna ask what I see when I transform, it's nothing. It's just like you or anyone else falling asleep. I close my eyes, a few seconds of darkness, then I wake up, covered in people's different body parts and viscera.

I awoke the next morning, covered in blood, a piece of a person's scalp sticking from my teeth, blood covering my body, bits of bone stuck to my clothes. I felt something hard, wet in my mouth, as I got up, walking to the toilet and spitting out someone's finger bone.

I sighed, flushing the bone, before walking back to the bed to watch the news and hear what I had done. The moment I turned on the TV, I saw a police sketch of what I'd turned into. No nose, no hair, beady, pale blue eyes, pointy ears, completely white skin, large teeth sticking from my jaws, sunken in cheeks. I’d killed 2 people who were completely unidentifiable from what I'd done, a man, three prostitutes, and… Two children.

I got up, running to the toilet to vomit. It's happened before, that thing killing children in my body, but every time I see it happen, it doesn't stop me from vomiting.

If you're gonna ask why I don't just do the job myself, it's because this thing has whispered in my ear that I can't die by my own hand, that I'd need someone else to do it with some form of golden blade or bullet.

Around 5 days ago, I fell asleep, waking up with the smell of iron filling the room of the abandoned house I had fallen asleep in, feeling a particularly large shard of bone poking me in my side. I pulled out my phone, checking the local news.

An old woman who had been unfortunate enough to be taking a smoke as I passed through, 2 men who were on their way home from a party together, and an unidentifiable splatter of blood covering the side of a convenience store.

I sighed, before hearing a voice. “Do it again tonight… It was fun…” I paused. That never happened, besides from the first three nights… It spoke to me. That fucking thing spoke to me, and it wasn't even near night time.

Today, I was at the grocery store, grabbing supplies, like a bunch of coffee to keep myself up as long as possible, barely enough food to last for around a month, and a case of water. Then, I heard it. “Do it… Stab the mother and her baby next to you…”

1p4xydf,https://www.reddit.com/r/productplace/comments/1p4xydf/where_can_i_buy_a_teeth_whitening_kit_online/,Where can I buy a teeth whitening kit online right now?,"Looking to buy a teeth whitening kit online? You're in luck because getting one delivered to your door has never been easier.

The best place to find quality teeth whitening products right now is Amazon. They've got tons of options, fast shipping, and you can read real customer reviews before making a decision. Plus, if you have Prime, you might even get it delivered tomorrow.

**What Makes a Good Teeth Whitening Kit?**

Before you click ""buy now,"" here are some things you should look for:

**LED Light Technology** - Most effective kits come with an LED light that activates the whitening gel. This helps remove stains faster than strips alone.

**Peroxide-Based Formula** - The whitening gel should contain either hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide. These ingredients actually break down stains on your enamel.

**Comfortable Mouth Tray** - You'll be wearing this for 10-30 minutes at a time, so comfort matters. Look for flexible trays that mold to your teeth.

**Multiple Applications** - Good kits give you enough gel for several treatments, not just one or two uses.

**Where to Order Your Kit**

You can grab a professional-grade [teeth whitening kit here](https://athomewave.com/teeth-whitening-kit) and have it shipped straight to you. Amazon stocks various brands at different price points, so you can find something that fits your budget.

**Price Range**

Most at-home whitening kits cost between $20 and $80. The cheaper ones usually just have strips or basic gel. The mid-range options (around $30-50) typically include LED lights and better quality whitening formulas. These tend to show better results.

**How Fast Will You See Results?**

Most people notice their teeth getting whiter after 3-5 uses. For best results, you'll want to use your kit consistently for about two weeks. Some stubborn stains from coffee, wine, or smoking might take longer to fade.

**Safety Tips**

Teeth whitening is generally safe, but here's what you need to know:

- Don't overuse it. Follow the instructions on your specific kit
- Your teeth might feel sensitive for a day or two after treatment (this is normal)
- Avoid dark-colored foods and drinks right after whitening
- If you have dental work like crowns or veneers, those won't change color

**Ready to Get Started?**

If you want brighter teeth without paying for expensive dental office treatments, ordering online is your best bet. Check out the options available [at this link](https://athomewave.com/teeth-whitening-kit) and pick the kit that looks right for you.

Most orders arrive within 2-3 days, so you could be whitening your smile by this weekend. Just make sure to read the product descriptions and customer reviews to find a kit with good ratings.

I'm Alex Miller, and, as the title implies, if you see me, please put me down. Every night, ever since I went down to Louisiana and got my fortune told, I've turned into… Something, every night.

In the woman's exact words, (I think, the sleep deprivation is starting to take its toll), she said, “Oh no, child. Something will take over your body at night, be warned. Keep your distance from others, for their safety.”

Of course, I just laughed it off and went on with the rest of the trip with my friends. I wasn't laughing so much, however, once I woke up the next morning, covered in blood, gore and chunks of bone, and my friends were gone.

I didn't have any idea what happened for the first few nights, I just knew I had to get far away. Honestly, with how long I've had to deprive myself of sleep to keep that thing at bay, I don't even know how long ago that first night was. Could've been 2 weeks, could've been 2 years.

I'm here to tell you all of what I've done, or what I may have done, for the past 2 weeks.

About 2 weeks ago, I was slowly shambling up the stairs of a motel, praying I could lock myself into my room for the night before I fell asleep to at least give everyone else some form of safety.

I hadn't slept in 8 days, and I could feel sleep's gentle, terrifying call lulling me. With shaky hands, dropping the key multiple times, I opened the door, slipping inside, barely able to lock the door and bolt the chain before falling to my knees. I could feel the crack of my bones extending in my arms and fingers, the tearing of the flesh covering my shoulder blades as wings slowly extended from the holes in my flesh.

I fell to the floor, my eyes slipping closed as sleep took me under, my last thought being the hope that the door lock and chain would be enough. If you're gonna ask what I see when I transform, it's nothing. It's just like you or anyone else falling asleep. I close my eyes, a few seconds of darkness, then I wake up, covered in people's different body parts and viscera.

I awoke the next morning, covered in blood, a piece of a person's scalp sticking from my teeth, blood covering my body, bits of bone stuck to my clothes. I felt something hard, wet in my mouth, as I got up, walking to the toilet and spitting out someone's finger bone.

I sighed, flushing the bone, before walking back to the bed to watch the news and hear what I had done. The moment I turned on the TV, I saw a police sketch of what I'd turned into. No nose, no hair, beady, pale blue eyes, pointy ears, completely white skin, large teeth sticking from my jaws, sunken in cheeks. I’d killed 2 people who were completely unidentifiable from what I'd done, a man, three prostitutes, and… Two children.

I got up, running to the toilet to vomit. It's happened before, that thing killing children in my body, but every time I see it happen, it doesn't stop me from vomiting.

If you're gonna ask why I don't just do the job myself, it's because this thing has whispered in my ear that I can't die by my own hand, that I'd need someone else to do it with some form of golden blade or bullet.

Around 5 days ago, I fell asleep, waking up with the smell of iron filling the room of the abandoned house I had fallen asleep in, feeling a particularly large shard of bone poking me in my side. I pulled out my phone, checking the local news.

An old woman who had been unfortunate enough to be taking a smoke as I passed through, 2 men who were on their way home from a party together, and an unidentifiable splatter of blood covering the side of a convenience store.

I sighed, before hearing a voice. “Do it again tonight… It was fun…” I paused. That never happened, besides from the first three nights… It spoke to me. That fucking thing spoke to me, and it wasn't even near night time.

Today, I was at the grocery store, grabbing supplies, like a bunch of coffee to keep myself up as long as possible, barely enough food to last for around a month, and a case of water. Then, I heard it. “Do it… Stab the mother and her baby next to you…”

I felt my hand twitching towards the pocket my pocket knife was in. I was able to stop myself, quickly leaving the store after paying for my items. That thing was starting to gain control during the day. It was starting to gain control during the day and I couldn't stop it.

My husband is turning 40 right after Christmas, we’ve been married 15 years, and we have three kids (5, 7, and 9). He’s the kind of guy who gets annoyed if something just sits on a shelf collecting dust, so I’m trying super hard to only get stuff he’ll actually use and love.  

Random list of things he’s into:  
- fishing (mostly bass, from shore or his kayak)  
- biking (he does a lot of road and gravel rides)  
- Legos like the bigger display type sets, not the little $10 ones  
-good coffee (he does pour-overs every morning)  
- pickup basketball whenever he can  
- softball league with his buddies  
- bugs — he and the kids are weirdly obsessed with catching and pinning insects  
- Perler beads (he makes these huge detailed designs with the kids)  
- Breaking bad and Game of thrones (has rewatched both a million times)  
- he teaches 6th grade math and actually likes it  

Budget wise I’d rather do one ior two bigger things ($50–200 range) that make him go “whoa, cool” than a bunch of smaller stuff he’ll forget about.  

I’m just stuck. Every idea I have feels either boring or like something that’ll end up in the donate pile in six months.

College is annoying, mainly commuting, the amount of time it takes out of my week, and the stupid assignments. Plus I'm expected to revise for one hour every day. Then obviously there's work, where I just cook fries or burgers all day. 

I have barely any time to actually do the housework, so there's stains from my mum making food or coffee everywhere, or mouldy food that I don't notice until too late left on the side or in the sink because she doesn't scrape off her plate. Or her empty cans everywhere, or bits on the floor because I have no time to vacuum. At least I can do the washing, but my mum doesn't take her clean clothes back to her room. The bit get too full, so then my mum just puts the trash on the floor in front of it instead

My main source of friendship comes from pen palling, but I'd like a friend closer to home. I currently have no one to go anywhere with me, or talk nonsense with face-to-face.

If we were to hit it off and you'd be open to meeting up, I'd like to do things like:

\- Visit the theatre

\- Charity/thrift shopping

\- Dine out/grab a coffee(or poncy juice. Really into poncy juice at the moment).

\- Craft fairs/farmers markets

\- Take some classes together

\- Comedy clubs

\- Themed brunches/afternoon tea

\- Stroll around a park while we bitch about stuff

\- Salsa dancing (this is my secret thing I've always wanted to try, but I'm too nervous).

This isn't an exhaustive list and I know things are expensive, so not expecting these to be an every meet occurrence.

Some of my likes are crafting, reading romance, creative writing, pen palling, listening to podcasts/music, tacos, buying tut and drinking said poncy juice.

***Thursday***

“You’re being very quiet over there,” Pepper said as Lucas pulled up to the guard shack outside 1PP and waited for the officer to raise the barricade. She reached across the dashboard, picked up the parking pass from in front of the steering wheel, and waved it at him pointedly. “And this wasn’t out when you dropped me off last night.”

Lucas took it off her with a sigh and slid it back onto the dash, wanting more than anything to avoid the subject. “So, how did things go with your parents after I left?” God, he almost cringed at how blatant that subject change was. Even *Sam* would’ve seen through it.

So there was no surprise when Pepper squinted at him like he was dancing on her last nerve as the boom was raised. Lucas pretended not to notice, focusing instead on driving the car forward once the boom lifted, and waving at the guard.

“You’re seriously starting to piss me off, partner. What happened? I’ll pull rank if I have to, since it obviously involves the badge.”

Lucas was proud of the fact that he didn’t groan … or whimper. “It didn’t involve our task force.”

“That’s a start.”

He breathed out slowly as they crossed the lot. “Fine. If you must know, I dropped into the 9th to talk to a pair of roving uniforms.” His initial belief—that Boyd and Larry had been separated by a foot patrol—was quickly torpedoed. None of the beat cops remembered seeing Boyd, but word filtered through the ranks about a guy nearing seven feet tall having an argument in the street with a Black man, and two others approached him—officers who’d been doing a drive-by at the time.

*A drive-by!* Sure, they were quick to say it hadn’t escalated past some chest-bumping and shouting—but it had been loud enough for them to pull over and intercede.

When asked what his interest was, he hadn't hidden the fact that Boyd was his fiancé, and confirmed the Black man had been Boyd’s best friend for over a decade. That had gelled with what they’d observed at the time, for the argument had been over the big guy’s safety; something they still thought was hilarious.

Lucas mentioned how he still wanted Larry to be Boyd’s best man. They’d laughed and said, “You might want to rethink that, pal—unless you’re keen on a Red Wedding re-enactment. They might be friends ordinarily, but I’m telling you, they were seconds from throwing serious punches. And one real hit from your fiancé, and you’d have had homicide crawling all over you.”

Lucas didn’t bother pointing out that between the two, Larry was far more lethal.

He’d conceded that airing it in public had been a mistake and had promised to take care of it. No other outcome was acceptable to him. There was simply too much history between them.

After that, he’d said a brief goodbye to Caveat and Jones and left the 9th to pick up his partner.

Still stewing over it, he pulled into an empty parking space and turned off the ignition.

“Annnd?” Pepper pushed, folding her arms.

“Annnd,” he mimicked. “I’m marrying an idiot.” An idiot who would find himself duct-taped to a chair with Larry until they sorted their shit out if their crap ever spilled over onto the streets again.

And he’d do it, too. They may be bigger and stronger than him, but he’d grown up with four older brothers and had learned to be sneaky.

 Since he didn’t know where they’d be having lunch, Lucas left his lunch bag in the back and opened his door with every intention of climbing out, but Pepper’s hand on his forearm stopped him.

“Shut the door and talk to me, partner. It’s private here, and we have a few minutes.”

Translation: they could speak freely about divine matters without worrying about the veil.

Sighing, he settled back into the seat and filled her in: from the lead-up between them as he knew it, to the final explosion that had Larry banned from the table last night.

At the end, Pepper blew out a breath. “You’re going to have to get them to sit down and talk,” she said, as if Lucas needed that stellar piece of advice.

“Yeah, and I think I might have Sam lurking in the background so I can draw on his guards to act as divine buffers if things do get out of hand between them.”

“Not a bad idea.”

Satisfied with the outcome, Lucas left the car and scanned the other vehicles and empty spaces around them, letting him know they were the first of their task force to arrive. “So, your parents?” he asked as they headed for the front doors of 1PP.

“I think they want to adopt Sararah,” she said with a warm chuckle. “They spent half the night grilling her about her upbringing, and Sararah practically killed herself trying to keep everything in terms they’d understand. She tried so hard, and they took her enthusiasm as desperation to connect with something meaningful.”

Lucas chuckled. “Would that be such a bad thing? For your divine best friend to be loved by your parents?”

“It certainly hasn’t hurt you and Robbie.”

They were buzzed through the front desk and took the elevator up to the ninth floor, where the task force was located. As he expected, none of the other detectives assigned to the case were in the room…

…but Daniel was, resting his butt on the corner of the table with his arms folded and his feet crossed at the ankle—a distinctly unhappy look on his face.

Lucas glanced at Pepper, who returned his look with one of her own that said, *‘I don’t know. What did* you *do?’*

“I hear you had an interesting morning, Detective Dobson,” the inspector said, staring specifically at him, answering the *who* question.

Both came to a halt, with Pepper remaining at Lucas’ side.

“Nothing work-related, sir,” he said, still wondering what this was about.

“Don’t you have enough of your own work to do, detective?”

Lucas’ frown deepened into a scowl. “With all due respect, sir—what I do off the clock is my business.”

“Unless you do it in a precinct using your credentials as a 1PP detective. Then, everything you do becomes my business, as your actions are a direct reflection on this division. You’re an MCS detective, and you allowed yourself to do a coffee run for a pair from Missing Persons? What were you thinking?”

Lucas’ eyes shot wide at the angry accusation, but half a second later, they were narrowing furiously. This had been the last thing he’d thought he was in trouble for. “I was *thinking,”* he answered, fighting to keep his voice steady when all he wanted to do was rail at his boss for his elitist views—the very views he’d spent over an hour that morning tearing apart at the 9th. “That we’re all NYPD, and that class distinctions between divisions and ranks are—if you will excuse my French—bullshit posturing at best, and a hindrance bordering on full-blown case derailment at worst. At the end of the day, we all bleed blue, and none of us are inconsequential, *sir.”*

Okay, so maybe he hadn’t quite kept it as neutrally professional as he hoped, but for crying out loud! This guy was supposed to be *Lady Col’s son.* She would kick his ass (or more likely have the pryde do it for her) if she heard him spouting this crap.

“I couldn’t have said that better myself, young man,” a woman’s voice said from the doorway behind them.

The way Pepper spun with him, she hadn’t heard their visitor approach either, but their spines immediately straightened when Police Commissioner Yeager filled the doorway. Her smile was one of pride as she looked Lucas up and down. “Dobson, isn’t it?”

Dobson never looked away from her. Not for an instant. “Yes, ma’am.”

Her eyes moved to Daniel. “I see why you grabbed him as fast as you did.”

Only then did Daniel’s hard features soften into a hint of a smile. “Yes, ma’am.”

She slowly turned back to Lucas, looking him up and down and humming thoughtfully to herself. Then, without a word, she stepped back and headed towards the elevators at the end of the hallway.

Lucas didn’t move until he heard the sound of the elevator dinging and the doors shutting a few seconds later. Then he turned to Daniel. “Sir, what just happened?”

Instead of answering, Daniel pulled a folded piece of paper from his breast pocket and handed it over. It was an update to a Missing Persons case from the 9th—about an eighty-nine-year-old male with dementia found in the boiler room of Bushwick Community High. Specifically – the *closed* case.

Lucas couldn’t hold back the smile. “So, it *was* him.”

“How did you know to look for him in a completely different borough?” Daniel asked purposely.

Lucas went to hand back the page. “He was a groundskeeper at Bushwick High before my time. My dad was always talking up his dedication to the job, and something about his face was familiar when I saw his picture on the board. I don’t blame Caveat and Jones for not going over there before now. That’s a seven or eight mile walk from his retirement home, and that old man couldn’t go fifty feet with his walker without stopping an hour to recover. I have no idea how he made it across the river by himself, but putting one foot in front of the other, no matter the obstacle, was something Dad always looked up to in him.” Lucas’ hand faltered. “Why would you even have this, sir? It’s not our case…”

“Have a look at the bottom of the page, Detective.”

Lucas dropped his eyes and saw where his name and badge number had been added to the official report. Caveat and Jones were sharing credit with him!

His jaw fell slack as he brought his eyes up to Daniel. “I never asked for this,” he said quickly, just in case Daniel thought otherwise.

“I know. You were just being you. But in doing so, you proved my point to the commissioner about why I fast-tracked you into my division, and she wanted to see what made you tick for herself.” He glanced at the open doorway and chuckled quietly. “You were a little more passionate than I thought you’d be…”

“Because I couldn’t believe someone raised by your mother would have such a ridiculous elitist attitude, sir.” At Daniel’s sharpening look, he added, “The rest of your family, sure. It’s in their genetic make-up to be a bit dick-ish around humans. But not you. People, regardless of station, matter to you *and* your mother.”

“So, that whole scene was just a test?” Pepper asked.

Daniel pulled himself onto his feet and straightened his jacket. “I hope you’re okay with public speaking, detective,” he said with a secretive smirk on his way out the door.

Lucas looked at Pepper, then turned to watch him leave.

*What does public speaking have to do with being a detective?*

1p4xp8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1p4xp8n/another_one_bites_the_dust_36/,Another One Bites the Dust (3/6),"Part 3- Josuke Higashikata

The beeping of a landline awoke Josuke from his deep slumber. Infuriated that his beauty sleep had been interrupted, he snatched the phone.

“Who the fuck is this?  
A kid’s voice rang out. “Sorry. Wrong number.” And he hung up.

*Dumbass kid prank calling me.* He closed his eyes again, but no sleep came. *Fine, I’ll get up.* He checked the time- 7:24. *It’s pompadour time.*

By 8:08, the hair was complete. Wild blue-black locks combed into a thick clump, showered with a hundred serums and potions finished off with more pomade than a child could choke on. Despite this, the pompadour was light and fluffy, bouncing on Josuke’s head while he walked. It was his pride and joy, his heart and soul- no slander against it could go unnoticed.

“Wow, Josuke, you’re up early.” Josuke’s mother Tomoko echoed over a faint Virtual Insanity, as Josuke descended to the kitchen. He took a swig of some coffee his mother had prepared, as he scrambled some eggs. “Some little kid prank called me and woke me up. I’ll strangle that little shit when I find him.” He flipped his eggs flamboyantly in their pan.

“Language, Josuke!” Tomoko was certainly a doting mother, thanks to Josuke’s lack of a father. *Jotaro’s grandfather, Joseph. They say he was the strongest Stand user of his time. Certainly the poorest father.*

“Sorry!” he yelled over the sizzling. “Is Okuyasu here yet?”

“The short one?” 

“No, the stupid one.” Tomoko always got Koichi and Okuyasu confused, despite them being complete opposites in every facet.

“He’s awkwardly standing outside my door.” *Like he always does. Good ol’ dependable Okuyasu.*

Okuyasu stumbled through the door, hair slicked back revealing a chunky forehead, baggy pants he stole from Josuke and twin green belts he purposefully slackened. He greeted Tomoko, and before a single step was placed in the Higashikata home, he knocked into a vase, and like a domino, smashed into the shoe cabinet, dust splattering over Josuke’s precious Air Jordans. He clenched his teeth. “Yikes.”

“Okuyasu!” Tomoko yelled. “You moron!”

“Sorry Ms Higashikata. I’ll clean it up.” He began picking up shards of pottery with his fingers.

“No, it’s fine. Josuke will do it.”

“Will I?”

“Oh yes you will! He’s *your* friend!”

“Josuke?”

“Yes Okuyasu?”

“Your eggs have burnt.”

Whatever remained of the scrambled eggs was reduced to a black mush. He slammed the pan against the hob. “Shit!”

“Language!”

“I’m leaving!” Josuke slammed on a jacket, beckoning Okuyasu over. Tomoko attempted to kiss him while he dodged ferociously. “I’m going in 5 if you want a ride?”

“We’re good.”

“Great. Clean this up. I’m gonna get my keys.” Tomoko left the boys by the door, and her footsteps got ever fainter. *Alright. Crazy Diamond time.*

He touched a rather large shard of the vase, as it slowly began to shiver and float in the air. Other pieces began to float too, forming a jigsaw of the pre-Okuyasu vase, until the vase had itself returned to its original state. Josuke’s Stand ability Crazy Diamond was the medic of Jotaro’s group- allowing the gang to make stupid decisions knowing any broken bones or cracked ribs could be easily fixed by the benevolent Josuke. Okuyasu especially abused Josuke’s ability- using it as an excuse for his clumsiness. Okuyasu’s Stand was one Jotaro would call advanced, but Okuyasu was not. The Hand had the ability to erase any space and fuse it together. A powerful ability at the fingertips of an idiot.

“I sometimes wonder if you’re stupid on purpose, Okuyasu.”

“Nope. I’m just this way.” *I suppose acknowledging his own stupidity makes him less stupid.* After a rather eventful morning, Josuke and Okuyasu were on the road by 8:22. *Great timing.*

“So,” Okuyasu asked as they walked, “anything on Kira?”

*Ahh, yes. The infamous killer.* It was all the gang had been hunting for these past few weeks, and with good reason. He was a blight on the town of Morioh, prowling in plain sight like a panther, protected by his Killer Queen, until one little slip up gave him away. He had nigh on murdered Jotaro and Koichi before Josuke’s Crazy Diamond arrived. The viper snuck from their grasp, and used another Stand user to switch his face. *Only to whose, we don’t know.*

“Rohan has a lead. We’re meeting him today. It's a guy called Kosaku Kawajiri.”

“Why this guy?”

“His own son’s been seen stalking him for weeks. The kid’s 11, and has been taking photos of the guy in public. Suspicious if you ask me.”

The two reached where Rohan said to meet them, the crossroads. But there was no sign of that handsome devil. Josuke saw some pedestrians, a man and his son, and thought he might enquire.

“Excuse me sir, have you seen a goofy looking manga artist ‘round here?” he asked, a little confusion in his voice. The man was similarly confused, eyes darting around Josuke’s. *Strange.*

“Can’t say I have, boy.” Kira feigned. “Forgive me, but I-

“Hold up.” *175cm tall, broad and slender, black hair with shoots of white, and a little boy who’d been skulking him for the past weeks.* *Kosaku Kawijiri. What a surprise.* He checked his watch. 8:23. *Rohan’s gonna be pissed if I find the killer before him.* “I don’t want to sound like a serial killer, but are you Kosaku Kawajiri, by any chance?”

“Nope. Never heard that name.” Kosaku spun, but Josuke placed a firm hand on his shoulder and braced Crazy Diamond.

“No, I think you are. I’d like to ask you some questions, if you don’t mind.”

“I very much mind, boy. Take your hand off me!”

Only now had Okuyasu realized what was going on. “Who’s that you got there Josuke?”

“A suspect.” he announced, but Kosaku wasn’t listening. His son whispered in his ear, and he whispered back, until Josuke’s watch ticked 8:24.

“THAT MAN IS YOSHIKAGE KIRA! YOU HAVE EXACTLY ONE HOUR TO KILL HIM!” The boy bellowed.

In an instant, Kira summoned his stand. *But it's little match for mine.*

Crazy Diamond launched Kira twenty feet, smashing him through a brick wall into a sandpit, while Okuyasu took Josuke’s hand and teleported them forward atop the brick fence.

“So, Yoshikage Kira, was it? Nice to meet you for the second time.”

“Likewise. Your Crazy Diamond’s pretty strong.”

“Certainly is. Stronger than yours.”

“Probably. But what’s brawn over brain?” Killer Queen clicked its thumb, and Kira’s eyes were plastered on the brick wall they sat on.

“OKUYASU! THE BRICKS! UNDERNEATH!” The boys jumped off the wall as the bricks detonated, Josuke a pace ahead of Okuyasu. His foot caught aflame as the two tumbled to the ground while Kira sat peacefully in the sandpit.

“My Killer Queen can turn anything it touches into a bomb. You are no match for its power.”

“We don’t need to be a match for its power. Your kid said we’ve got an hour to kill you. You think you can last that long?”

“I could last a century against you fools.”

“Once Jotaro gets here, you won’t last a minute.”

“When Jotaro arrives, you will be nothing more than ash.”

Josuke struck Okuyasu’s foot with his Crazy Diamond, the fire engulfing it gone in an instant. The two then leaped towards the killer, Josuke striking Kira in the stomach as he tried to evade. The sand beneath him became stained with blood as Kira was launched backwards into the wall behind him, bones cracking on impact.

“So, it can heal objects? Clever.” Kira said, and slipped a hand into his pocket and removed his Nokia. He threw it at Josuke which his Crazy Diamond smacked as it flew, reducing it to a ball of smoke. But before Josuke could react, Kira hurled himself through the smoke, two fingers pronged to attack his Crazy Diamond. *He’s going to turn me into a bomb!*

Okuyasu slammed his hand down, the air sucking like a beer cap as he turned the air away from Josuke. Kira himself had moved thanks to the Hand’s ability, pointed away from Josuke, and straight at Okuyasu, a ring looped around it slowly sliding towards an unaware Okuyasu.

“OKUYASU! USE THE HAND!” But it was too late. A barrel-sized hole emerged in Okuyasu’s chest, skin and flesh rupturing under the strength of Killer Queen. He went lurching backwards through the air, landing limp on a fence, unmoving.

“KIRA!!!” Josuke threw another punch towards Kira, wild and uncontrolled, one Killer Queen easily blocked.

“Now, listen to me, Higashikata.” he purred. “Your friend remains alive, I’m sure, and you can heal him with your Crazy Diamond. But you'll have to take that risk.

“Fuck you!” he swung again, Kira slamming Kosaku’s wedding ring into Josuke’s stomach. Crazy Diamond barely managed to block it before Josuke too was flung into the fence beside Okuyasu.

“You’re outmatched, Higashikata. Give up, and when I reverse time you won’t be pained by knowing my existence.”

Josuke checked his watch, glass cracked from the impact. *8:30. 54 minutes left until we explode, and Kira reverses time. And when I die, I will die in every timeline where I say a word to Hayato, to which I know I will. I will never have this opportunity again. I will never know Yoshikage Kira’s true identity.* He looked at a moaning Okuyasu, blood trickling down the fence. *But I can’t let Okuyasu die on my watch.*

Josuke raised his hand, ready to touch Okuyasu, before a yell broke his movement.

“Stop! He’s turned Okuyasu into a bomb! Don’t touch him!”

It was Kira’s kid, that Hayato. He had come running through the gate to the garden, backpack slung over his shoulder and perfectly sharpened pencil in hand.

“How would you know? You’re not a Stand user!” Only Stand users could see other Stands. *That’s why mom thinks I’m a master craftsman, after I perfectly restore the vases Okuyasu breaks.*

“I just know! He threw two fingers forward, remember! One to bomb Okuyasu, and another to turn him into one!” 

Josuke turned to the killer, as he picked his teeth, unbothered. “Maybe I have, maybe I haven’t. All you have to do to find out is to touch him.”

*Damn you, Kira. You crook.* “Wait, Mister Josuke!”

“WHAT?”  
“You can heal things, right?”

“Yes, why?”

“Can you heal them after death?”

“One or two seconds after, yes?”

And with that Hayto lunged towards Okuyasu, reaching out his little fingers towards his skull. In an instant, Hayato was overrun with flame, and in another, his body was restored and he lumped to the ground.

Kira’s mouth hung low while he gritted his teeth. “Hayato, you little shit!”

""Get out of here kid!"" Josuke yelled. ""Get off this street now!""

""He won't get that far."" Kira lunged forward like a lion, flinging a shirt button like a frisbee towards the kid. Josuke kicked it away before it could land and struck the killer in his stomach. He jerked awkwardly to the left, smahsing into a window and rolling down some pensioner's carpet like a beetle. Josuke bucked forward to go after him, but Hayato caught his hand.

""Wait, Mr Josuke!""

""I thought I told you to get outta here, kid!""

""No, sir. You need to get out of here. You can't take him now, look at you.""

As much as he would love to fight on, Hayato was right. Josuke could feel the hot blood trickling down his leg, dripping onto his shoes. It pained to walk, not to mention Okuyasu. *I am in no position to fight now. I must get help. Call Rohan. He should be nearby.*

Josuke hung Okuyasu over his shoulder, leg throbbing, limping towards a house across the street, while Hayato dashed down the road. His watch ticked 8:36, as he slammed into some poor soul’s living room.",4,1763931327.0,creepcast,6,1.0,False

He said the thing I needed to hear as he left - ""sorry"". Why do they say what you need to hear when they leave?","It's really for the best. We had a great relationship while we dated - 10 years. We got married 5 years ago. He then decided to stop taking his anxiety/ptsd meds, stop therapy. I haven't liked him since then. He rants. Gets himself worked up. He explodes & says horrible things. Yesterday he told me I'm a bragger, a liar, I'm materialistic... Told me I'm never satisfied. Told me I should have sex because we are married - that's an issue, because when he rants, I'm reminded of how much I dislike this personality. He never apologizes. He just thinks I should get over it. I don't feel like having sex, because he's not who I married & I'm always getting over the last rant. He thinks it's a ""duty"" to have sex when married. & he made a joke & laughed about something he did to me early on that almost caused us to split. He apologized then, but yesterday he brought it back up to upset me. Just a full day of ranting, that started with him getting upset that I asked a question too early in the AM. He was up before me, making coffee. I hugged him. Said good morning. Poured coffee. Wondered out loud if I should buy a new dishwasher & install it ourselves or use paper plates on Thanksgiving & wait for a Black Friday sale. (Our dishwasher just tanked, 6 days before Thanksgiving. ) & bam. Rage. He wasn't going to clean up on Thanksgiving. Not going to get up & smoke a turkey & be tired all day. & it just escalated into he hates me. & I 100% didn't back down this time. I'm tired of using all my negotiating skills & calm energy to diffuse the situation. Tired of walking away & dealing with his crap. Worried he would do this on Thanksgiving in front of the whole family. I told him things like ""yeah? What else do you have to say? What else do you hate about me? Just rip off the band-baid! Get it all out!!!"" & it just kept flowing forth, like sewage. & it hurt. I'm 50/50 on if he really meant it, if that's how he really feels or if it's the ptsd/anxiety. He never brought any of it up before, in a calm way. It's only when he's ranting & raging. He's never been violent with me, btw. I don't feel that he would. His mouth just won't stop running. 

So today, he's been quiet, packing his car. He's headed to stay with family out of state, but he packed like it's the preliminary trip of a permanent move. Mentioned bringing a truck back.

Today, I wanted to test **Cinematic Composition** and **Text Rendering** with some ""Leaked Behind-the-Scenes"" photos for a live-action Iron Giant movie.

**The Verdict:**  
To be fair, **Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview** generally edges out Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 on text rendering clarity and overall pixel polish. It consistently delivers that ""high-budget"" look. **However, the difference is not nearly as big as the hype suggests.**

**Suspiciously Similar Compositions:**  
Look at the **Prop Shop** and the **Volume Stage**. The framing, lighting angles, and object placement are almost identical. It feels suspiciously like they share similar architecture or were trained on very similar synthetic datasets.

**The Local Advantage:** While Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview might be 5-10% better on raw fidelity, Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 generated these in **10 seconds** on my RTX 5090. Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview is a ""slot machine"" (you get what you get). Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 gives control, if you want to change the lighting, you can use a LoRA.

These emails are Melissa Moore. If you’re unfamiliar, Melissa Moore’s father, is the “Happy Face Killer” , Keith Jesperson, he is a serial killer. She’s an executive producer and helped Gypsy get her book deal.

1.  Gypsy says to Melissa Moore, “i would need to talk to you when you have time. it is somewhat important. I would like to talk about handling the book and podcast earnings without my parents being involved. I do not feel comfortable involving them anymore. Whatever the studio has left to send for my documentary is still fine but I no longer wish to entrust my fiances with them for future projects I’ll explain on the phone”, Gypsy also says, “I am giving Power of Attorney to Ryan to handle financial business and to be able to sign in my place. Beginning March 15 and ending December 28th.”


2.  Gypsy says to Melissa Moore, “Got the other pics, Ryan doesn't look like himself but he is the only person I know who looks different based on angles in every picture I have of him. I held it up to photos that I had the picture girl in visiting take of him based on select angles and the two look totally different. Because he is bigger shots need to come from above not lower or head on. But it is what it is. it just isn't the best likeness is all. are their better more flatterina shots?”


3.  Gypsy says to Melissa Moore, “-someone- read the book proposal to me and what I found is...without trying to be insulting, that the overall framework of words was bare boned. It reminded me of listening to Forest Gump and made me cringe. It was your very basic wording. I often use more intellectual words for example instead of saying ""People said my mom poisoned my step grandma would have said ""It was speculated that my mother had poisoned my step grandmother with RoundUp"" -someone-also uses mom and I actually rarely call my mother mom, I refer to her as mother because I now call Kristy mom. Also there were consistent repetitive words and words that should have used commas where the repetitive ands were placed.
The story read very factual however lacked emotion, texture, and emersion and to a degree intelligence. One thing everyone comments on even when living with my mother is how articulate I am with words and that did not translate with the way this reads. NOTES  \#1. My mother did not work at the hospital after I was born she took a job at a bar called PJs when I was toddler age and later took odd jobs such as photo restoration on her computer. \#2 It reads more then once that i had no participation in Mommy Dead and Dearest but I did participate in the HBO documentary Mommy Dead and Dearest, however I did not have financial compensation. and it was not a docuseries it was a single documentary. \#3 In the beginning it read ""My childhood was great but then I got sick"" Then the next paragraph reads I had x amount of surgical procedures at 11 months old."" That is contradictory to the beginning paragraph. From birth my mother claimed I was sick however as a child I at least was allowed to be more social with my mothers side and have some good memories as a child, I would not say great though. \#4 Ken and I did not mutually break up, he left me devastatingly brokenhearted. I want readers to feel the strength of the pain that I felt. After all I had gone through, I thought I had went through it to get to this person who would love me and he let me down just like everyone else in my life. -Someone- jodded down other notes of errors in grammar and proper English and pretty much the same notes. For a proposal it is ok but I do NOT want -someone-  to write the manuscript. I just can't see a whole book of this shit. it is all facts and no heart. Nothing tugged at me to make me feel anything but bored and depressed.” Gypsy also says, “I emailed -someone-  with some thoughts. it might offend her but it is my story and i am not settling.” 


4.Melissa Moore forwards an email to Gypsy that she wrote to the ghost writer Gypsy has a problem with, which says,  “Here is what I sent to -someone- to read to you and get your notes on: Thank you for sending the proposal. I had forwarded it immediately to Gypsy before my own review of it and got a quick response from her that same day-she was deeply offended. During my own review, I dissected the proposal to understand why she had such a negative reaction. First, it mainly was due to the lack of her own voice missing in the proposal. While the writing is factual it lacks her tone and reduces her vocabulary to an elementary grade level. We assume the lack of voice comes from her interviews not being directly pulled from and injected into the writing. Second to voice, there aren't any emotional moments we enter into through the writing. There is a play-by-play of timeline events. Again factual, just not taking the opportunity to have us experience a moment in time that Gypsy lived through, so we know what she felt. The sample chapter is where this really could have shined, for example, there is a memory Gypsy has of sleeping over at her cousin's home as a child and she is jumping on the bed when her aunt walks in. Immediately, she drops to the bed in tremendous fear and freezes knowing she was caught using her legs. Now being caught, hell will be paid when her mother discovers her lapse in the act. There are many memories Gypsy has of the transition of being healthy while her mother starts to train her to be sick that could be used for the sample chapter. Instead it opens with facts lined up of her date of birth and nickname--nothing an editor couldn't Google. The sample chapter is a chance to show that this book truly has never-before-heard stories that only she could tell. Third, and the least of the issues, the Overview isn't in first person. Here is an opportunity to address the fact that while there are many documentaries and even a tv scripted series, none of them tell her true story. Her story has been adapted and stolen. Something along the lines of, ""While millions of people watched The Act, I sat in my prison cell with no access to Hulu. To this day, I haven't been able to watch the series...People were watching a show starring me! I had no involvement ...People now are thinking they know me but they don't know point 1, point 2, point 3."" This could also be an open letter to the editor stating what people don't know or the mistruths people have of her. Now having addressed all the concerns, we feel it needs a complete rewrite to add her voice and to write a sample chapter that takes us into a moment of her life. I can send all of our notes of changes but at this point Gypsy has lost faith. propose we all cut our losses and end the agreement here.”, Gypsy responds, “I completely approve of the email for -someone-. You did great!!! you can send it whenever you wish.”


5.  Gypsy says to Melissa Moore, “I was talking with Ryan and we were coming up with ideas for my first year out of prison and what are some plans we hope to do within that time span. We were thinking of things that could potentially be highlights if we enter into a second phase of our project. Here is a list of what we are thinking: (Highlights) Release day, Cosmetic work, Wedding (redo), Honeymoon/Vacation, 1st baby. (Fillers) getting first tattoo job interviews book tour, Sitting down with parents and asking one on one questions about past. Facing fears going back to 2103 W Volunteer Way digging up hex jar.”


6.  Melissa Moore answers Gypsy and says, “These are great ideas, however, we need to start with present day-august first. We have to show that there are things happening while in prison in prep for your release such as: \#1 difficult conversations with -Blanchard?- family; how is it going to be when you're released? \#2 Ryan’s job, how will your release affect his employment? \#3 discovering what you can and can't do post prison. Will getting a job be harder? Etc. can you get a passport? Or there extra things now you have to do.. \#4 prep for leaving people you have come to love behind in prison. From now to August is a little bit of a slower period of time but we need a few beats to make sure it sets up the action


7.  Gypsy says to Melissa Moore, “There are some unknowns at play here. I don't have anything really leading up to my release. The prison doesn't require us to take any classes for release, there is no followup hearing or evaluation it is just a waiting game. I do not foresee me having any conversations with my mother’s side of the family. My cousin -someone- made it know that they will not appreciate me speaking about the molestation by my grandfather so l am guessing that my aunts -someone- and -someone- will hold back from speaking to me until the dust settles. Ryan’s employer already is aware of our marriage and made it a point to have a zoom call with their higher upers to make them aware of our situation.
What is concerning is will there be any negative repercussions to the documentary.”


8.Melissa Moore says to Gypsy, “I found a lot of resources for you so you can see that you'll be able to be a successful and independent person and there's a lot of help available. There is free money called grants, there's paid housing by the government that will pay for your apartment, there's food stamps. This is all to just help you start your nèe life and you won't need them long term.
Here's an example of what you could do on parole: \#1 apply to community college. Pell Grant will pay 100% of the college. \#2 apply for HUD, they will pay your apartment. \#3 apply for a part time job $17 an hour at Walmart as a stocker or associate, there's lots of other jobs too at different places. \#4 apply for state food stamps and healthcare. The state healthcare pays 100% dental and medical plus mental health. \#5 open a Capital One Bank account. Use the 360 savings. \#6 open a secured credit card. This will build you credit fast. Everyone is accepted. Use no more than 30% of the card limit at a time. As credit cards will ding you if you max out cards or use more than 50% of card limit. \#7 apply for local driving school. They can let you use driving simulators to practice before you have a car to use. Then after applying for these things look for apartments or housing. You have enough for a deposit and first months rent which is needed. Right now, you'll need to pull your credit and see what's on there. If there's fraud from your mom I’ll teach you how to fix.
Your credit is whats pulled when getting a place.”


9.  Melissa Moore gives advice to Gypsy about her diet, “On your canteen I'd make these changes: \#1 change RC Cola to diet. \#2 change sugar cubes to an artificial sweetener if they have one for your coffee. \#3 stop making your meals. Instead go to Breakfast, lunch and dinner at cafeteria. \#4 take your vitamins everyday. \#5 on your shopping list for snacks I'd only keep the popcorn because it has fiber, the peanut butter, the pickles, long grain rice and chicken. I'd pick one splurge as my max for the week either two Twix bars OR one pint of ice cream. I'd recommend not eating them first thing in morning as it will spike your blood sugar for the day. I'd go to cafeteria for ALL meals and follow this set of rules: protein, fruit, veggie. These are your always ""yes"" to eat. Heavy limit these: no white bread, no milk (because it has a lot of sugar) and no beverage (unless sugar free) no jello unless sugar free. Sugar= insulin. Insulin then turns calories into stored fat. Sugar is in white flour and of course regular sugar. They also make you automatically over eat. So eat sparingly as a treat. Example: Breakfast, fruit, rice, scrambled eggs, 2tbl diet, margarine, coffee. Skip toast, skip biscuits, skip French toast sticks. Unless whole wheat. Lunch: Eat the protein offered, the lettuce with dressing, veggie and fruit. Skip the bread, the crackers, cookies, fruit crisp. If grilled cheese sandwich is offered with soup l'd make that okay since the protein is coming from the cheese. Dinner: Skip the bread and beverage and jello that's not sugar free. The reason why I'd go to the cafeteria is that the meals offer a fruit or veggie and protein sources that are portion controlled for you and offer more than your canteen food. You may crave sugar or get headaches since you've had so much of it. But you'll have more energy once your body…”


10.  Gypsy says to Melissa Moore, “I'm watching this CNN documentary about Brittney Spears and the conservatorship she is under and I feel so much sympathy for her because I know what its like to be controlled and when Brittney talks about it, I feel her emotions because I felt that helpless feeling of being controlled and having a parent have paperwork saying that the parent has every right to control your life and you can't do a damn thing about it because everyone deems and sees you as mentally unstable or incompetent. It makes me so sad for her”


11.  Gypsy says to Melissa Moore, “So my current beliefs are centered around nature, karma and willpower. I came by paganism/Wicca, by means of an old roommate and friend of mine. She introduced me to it and I felt it was right for me. I wanted a natured based religion that believes in karma, good engery and bad engery. I feel your fate is in your hands rather then my previous Christian belief that all your life is been written by God already. I have the belief that if you don't like your fate, then change it because life is made of choices. Some would say I'm fated to turn out like my mother because of her life choices affected how I was raised, I say I make my own fate and change that because its in my hands and power to do so. That isn't to say I don't believe in God, I do believe there is a God, I just also believe in self willpower to steer your life in the direction you wanna go. I started learning about Wicca in late December 2020. I attend wicca service on Mondays. how I practice my religious belief? by allowing myself to let go of bad engery and allowing myself to give out positive engery toward others to introduce good karma to me. I often meditate and read tarot cards to guide my day and pull revelations about my life.
No, I have never cursed anyone, I would never do that to someone. Yes, I have attempted a love spell. It was in 2013 I created a spell to bind Nick and I together as lovers so he would never leave me in an attempt to cancel out my mother’s curse on me. I asked Nick to send me a lock of his hair and he did. I took a strand of his hair and I short strand of mine when my mother cut my hair routinely, and I twisted the two together and enclosed it in a photo of me and a photo of him and wrapped it in red yarn. The willpower of this spell was broken when I wrote to Nick  after he was sentenced and he wrote wanting to get back together, I rejected him and with closure the spell ended, and he was free to have new relationships. Curses and spells are like wishes or a prayer for something to happen it is called manifestation, and the karma you put in is how powerful it can be.”


12.  Gypsy says to Melissa Moore, “9 in the morning and 9 at night was med time. I was on a med that had a purple tent to it and made me sleepy. The medicine i was allergic to, had looked and smelled syrupy like pancake syrup...thats probably why i hate a lot of syrup on my pancakes today lol :-P “


13.  Melissa Moore said to Gypsy, “This is really good insight!! Very helpful! Please walk through normal fears she had and how she operated. Did she always answer the door? At home did you ever run, or walk around house? Tell me ahout her shoplifting and what she would steal”, Gypsy says, “No, she rarely answered the door unless it was expected company. She would let the person knock and knock and pretend not to be there even though her van was parked in the driveway. sometimes she would drive the van to another spot to appear like we weren't home. Our house looked like a horder house all the time unless she knew company was coming over. Her fears ranged from Lizards as a basic normal fear, to abnormal fears like me being in my own room for too long.
A few times she caught me on my computer while I was in my room so after catching me talking to people on Facebook on the computer, she didn't trust me enough to spend anytime in my own room. By 2015 I was limited to changing my clothes in my room and that's it, she would time how long it would take to change clothes and she would get up off her bed to check on what I was doing If I took a little too long in my room. she placed a reversed lock on my door so it had the lock on the outside of the door and I would have to ask her to unlock it so I could get dressed in my room.
No I didn't walk or run around the house if she was home, but when she wasn't home, I would walk and dance too. we had a CD player and I would listen to music that was forbidden like Katy Perry and dance. She didn't let me listen to pop artists because she said that was too little for the adult content in the lyrics. (I was 22 years old) As for shoplifting, we would go to Sams club or walmart and she would put me in the basket cart and she told me to slip things under my dress and sit on them. I did and we would steal so much stuff, like dvds, clothes, food, hygiene products. She sometimes would have me steal dvds and she would go resell them at a local video buy sell trade shop.”, Gypsy adds, “BTW she never shoplifted alone she needed me to be the one to use my wheelchair as a means to hide things.”, Gypsy continues, “I'm going to be writing you things I remember because lately my memories are clear as day, So they may be random emails but I'm writing what I can give you as it comes. When my mother and were living in the Slidell Housing complex, in 2004/2005, my mom had a neighbor she would sell her prescription medicine to for extra money. She started selling her weight loss pills but then she started selling her pain pills and xanax. This neighbor told other people in the complex, so she had more than one buyer. In 2015 my mother stole money from our neighbor Debby Akers, after Debby trusted my mom to put the money Debby made after doing a experimental trial for one of those companies that pay you to be a volunteer for a new drug or product, Debby knew mom had a safe and so Debby asked mom to put the 2k in the safe for her...mom agreed but stole a few hundred from the money. and when Debby realized the money was missing, mom played it off like it must have been Debbys disturbed older son”


14.  Gypsy says to Melissa Moore, “No my father and I never took a paternity test as it was never needed or asked for.
No, no one has investigated me for the fraud because it was clear in paperwork that it was always my mother who filled out the paperwork for everything.”, “Gypsy says, “I'm watching Accused Guilty or Innocent on AandE about a mother accused of MBP and its crazy to me how serious they take it and yet no one did anything for me. I'm starting to see just how much I slipped through the cracks....not like I didn't already know but its it weird find it mind boggling how much trouble she could have been in? to me she was the only mother like that and she got away with it until she died. How did the doctors not see it... I'm sorry I'm just thinking that's all”, Gypsy says, “oh did you see the new In Touch article Fancy did?
It was read to me and the whole article is BS. I had 1, only 1 relationship after Ken she's saying I date multiple men Ryan is furious about it. He texted -someone-! wanting her to contact In Touch to tell that journalist to not take any interviews from her again. -someone- refused. I can understand how Ryan would be pissed, she is slandering him. He never used me for money, in fact HE would send ME $300 a month for 2 years and never did an interview with anyone. So her claims are only her opinion off and the
relationship. She never liked him because he called her out as a con artist. She's had a vendetta ever since. My point is I'm a grown adult, even if I was having multiple men at my side, who cares... still haven't had a real date in my whole life so if her goal was to make me look like a huchie or ""unstable""....It won't work because people who know me know that broke my heart enough to where I am still not yet healed from that break up. Nothing she said added up, because in late August of 2019 I did that Enews interview talking about how yes, me and Ken were having issues due to massive media attention, but we were strong in our relationship. so the claim in this new article that I dumped him in August doesn't make sense. October 2nd was the actual date of our split. Anyway, it is irritating that she claims to be a family friend when we all have broken ties with her yet the media don't know..”, Gypsy says, “I had remembered a faded memory from when I was very little maybe 5, mom had a friend named Mark. He liked her and he fixed a room at his place for her and I. I didn't like him and so I spit on him. I only wanted my dad and mom to get back together and I was not happy with any guy that liked her otherwise. I sometimes feel like I deserved what happened because I guess if I wasn't happy with her being with another man and dad moved on with Kristy then she felt I was stopping her from having a life with anyone else so her focus was on me. My mom did love another man besides my dad. His name was -someone-, he is married now, but she loved him”, Gypsy says, “I wanted to write down anything I can remember about anything and I remember my mother disabled the doorbell on our Habitat house after the people from DFS came to the house, she said the sound was giving her anxiety.” Gypsy says, “ I remember something else...When I had to give a urine sample at the doctors, I'd pee in a cup but my mother would take it and prick her finger and add a drop of blood to the sample. Why? I don't know... it’s just another weird thing.”",10,1763930689.0,GRBSnarkBU,7,1.0,False
1p4xffa,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1p4xffa/brown_eyes/,Brown eyes,"Brown, typically is considered a rather dull colour, but when it’s met with sunlight and sparkles with a hint of shyness, genuineness and hope in someone’s eyes, its one of the most beautiful things I have ever witnessed in my life.

I did and didn’t know it then, but some of my prayers had been answered. I was Soo lost back then. I kept hoping I would find someone, anyone really who would see me, like actually see me, all of me. 

Then he happened to me, he didn’t just meet me or run into me, he happened. 


But let’s start from the very start from when I didn’t know where fate was dancing me away to and catch up to where I am now or er rather where we are…..


It was autumn, leaves were falling, evenings were getting colder and the sun was getting to be the comforting kind of warm as against summers killer heat. 

I was done with my midterm paper for the day and waiting until it was time for the buses at my university to head home.

 I was tired, soo tired, having spent countless sleepless nights, last minute cramming and ever-present depression as my fuel and black coffee as my fodder.


So in my wonderfully twilight state of mind, on that random mundane fated afternoon in October, I was sitting outside on the library bench waiting, listening to some music and generally people watching as I used to do, zoning in and out and just existing, and that’s when I noticed him.


HE was walking by, we had shared a conversation or two over social media, having decided we shall meet someday on campus, it was nothing out of the ordinary, until it was I suppose.

 He already was someone who even as a stranger on the internet I had never met, texted me replying to some generic quote I posted on my story, asking me if I was ok?

 No one knew I wasn’t ok. I played the part well. None of my “friends” knew or could even guess. Then how? How could he know? And instead of lying like I always did I said I wasn’t and he said I will be. 


Years have passed and in the end he was right, I turned out ok, I am doing fine, really fine not just pretending to be.


And so as I sat there, looking not really seeing, I noticed this guy walk buy, go a couple of metres away then turn around, then cross me and walk some more in the other direction, then turn around and repeat. 

I was honestly exhausted in every sense of the word and then I see this shy sweet sweet man just walking by atleast 4 times and I giggle after like weeks I just, the cuteness and absurdity of his actions.


I had already recognised him by the second time he had walked by, this was the guy who had been kind to me even when he didn’t have anything to gain from me. And now here he was too shy to just walk up to me to say hello.


 I still remind him even today, of the day we met and how awfully cute and goofy he was that day. 


After he walked by a couple of times and I was done with my giggle fest over the ridiculousness of it all, I got up and walked right upto him and said hello.


He was soo tall, much taller than my 5’4”, so I had to look up at him, the first thing I noticed about him were his eyes, expressive, sad, tired and yet full of mischief, adventure and high spirits. 

When I shook his hand and looked into those beautiful brown eyes and that shy blushing smile on his face, I knew he was going to be important to me, I didn’t know in what way he would fit into my life but I felt it in my gut.

 That had never happened before the crazy buzz at the bottom of my stomach, I firmly believe my soul recognised him that day more than my brain did, and yes we have been through the ringer, together, apart, etc it's been close to what 7-8 years now and the bottom line still is that fate had a play in us meeting and everything that was to follow, and for that I will forever be grateful.",0,1763930646.0,writers,6,0.33,False

I’ve done it for a longggg time but just recently these have started showing up. The discoloration isn’t related, I’m a barista so it’s just stained from coffee. They don’t really hurt unless I push hard on them. I have a few more but these are the biggest/oldest ones. Does anyone know what this could be? And what I could do? Thank you!!

I can't tell you the emotions I felt yesterday. Late Friday afternoon, I posted this in tears because I felt like I was failing my oldest child with only being able to get her very cheap items and not getting to celebrate her. I was totally in my feelings and really hurt that I couldn't do more. We are not materialistic and I know, logically, she will just be happy having her family celebrate her. She's had birthdays where it was only two items and an apology. She never complained and still enjoyed what she got. She is an amazing child that is so understanding. 

I didn't expect so many of y'all reactions and advice. I loved the advice y'all gave and grateful for every comment. When I saw people offering me money or asking for a wishlist, I ignored them because I didn't intend for this post to go like that. I ended up showing my husband the post because I was in tears from all the responses. We had a long talk about accepting help from strangers on the internet - I will lower my pride and make sure that my daughter feels celebrated on a milestone birthday.

I promise I am a hard worker. I work full time at two jobs, I do side gigs, I go to school full time (nursing student), I am a partial caretaker for my husband (seizure disorder, limited mobility, etc), and have been deeply struggling with my mental health because of stress. I don't take days off and when I am not at work or school, I am taking care of the millions of chores around the house, going to doctor appointments, or stressing myself out. I feel like I can never get a single break in and if I do, I feel like I'm wasting it and that it will be my fault if we get behind or something happens. I give everything I have to do better for my husband and kids so they will not have to feel as unstable I did growing up. I grew up in unheated winters of Indiana and went days without eating because our cabinets were bare and my parents had food avaliable at work so our hunger meant nothing. I knew there was no love and I have always been determined to never allow them to feel that same way. I have came up short many times and I struggle with not succeeding more.

I give this depressing vomit of words to say... the feeling of a community of strangers who read just a few paragraphs of what I wrote and just... helped. I got great advice, sweet stories of others who grew up with financial issues or those who's parents didn't give items but love, offers to help... I can't tell you the range of emotions I felt.

I asked my daughter to make a list of other things she wanted. I added things I knew she wanted or could use. Y'all bought everything. Y'all donated money. Someone spent over 200 dollars in several items and putting money in a a gift fund. So many people bought multiples.People added items. Like, her list is empty. She got over 200 dollars in credit on Amazon. 

Thank you, Reddit. 

I had the gifts sent to my job for privacy reasons and took her this morning. I told her then why she had so many. She cried, I cried... she is shocked that anyone would do this and was so moved. 

Right now, she is wrapped up in this beautiful blue blanket and watching a movie with her brothers. She got coffee with a gift card and bought her brothers snacks for the movie they're watching because she wants to return the same kindness to others. 

I have sat here for almost thirty minutes writing and deleting what I write. I can't tell you how life changing this is for everyone in our family. We got help from a community that had no reason to do so, she received kindness and support from a community that doesn't even know her name or what color eyes she has. 

We are very grateful for everyone here. 

Thank you, everyone. Thank you.",35,1763930398.0,Gifts,2,1.0,False

Yes, shopping giants are cheaper because they run on huge volume, but buying local means we continue shaping the character of our city, reduce our environmental impacts, and keep our local economy stable. 

Plus, it's better to purchase one really special, well-made gift that will last people a lifetime, rather than several low-quality ones. Less can be more.

He’s the quiet confident ,reserved type — polite, calm, not someone who flirts casually or tries to impress people. But from the very beginning, something about the way he acted around me felt different.

He asked for my number in front of two girls who clearly liked him and it was a convo about music and me producing music etc. He didn’t hesitate or lower his voice; he just asked in front of them as a “claim” moment. For someone like him, that was bold and I was nervous yet gracefully gave him my number. After that, he started sharing music with me and teasing me in this soft, warm way. He even made these little “wife” jokes — the playful type, not the cringey type — which completely surprised me given how reserved he normally is.

There was another moment that stuck with me: one day I was showing his coworker (the woman who introduced me to a client) a moodboard I had designed. He overheard, walked over, and said, while looking right at me, “Yeah, I’ll give my wife a budget and she’ll design whatever she wants.” I literally felt myself melt inside, but kept my cool and just sipped my water like it was no big deal. Then he randomly asked, “Is your client cute?” which didn’t make sense at first — but the more I think about it, the more I realize it was his indirect way of complimenting me or comparing other women to me without actually saying it.

While I was working in his branch, we built this slow, warm momentum. He’d talk to me more than he talks to most people, joke with me, get slightly competitive about music, and open up in small ways. One of the days, I decided to bring him coffee and a snack to give back the gesture he did, and we end up meeting in the morning and talking while he sipped on my coffee mug. Then suddenly, I had to leave and it stayed with him. Later, he told me he “gave up bringing it to work,” so now it’s sitting in his kitchen cabinet. He said it casually, but there was an undertone that felt oddly personal.

Then I was transferred to a different branch. Suddenly, we went three whole weeks without seeing each other — no accidental run-ins, no tiny morning interactions, nothing. During that gap, I sent him a song one night, just something that reminded me of our music teasing. A day later, when he finally warmed up, he messaged me and asked, “Where have you been?” He said I was missing out on the amazing weather at his branch and made it sound like the place felt different without me there. It was such a simple message, but it felt like he was hinting that he had noticed my absence more than he wanted to admit and he let’s say “misses me”.

Then last weekend, we both ended up at the same rave. I sent him a small message letting him know I was there, and he immediately asked where I was. Not once — multiple times. Eventually he texted, “can’t find you.” That shocked me because he rarely initiates anything. Instead of replying, I called him, and he stayed on the phone with me until I got to the gate. He sounded nervous and a bit tipsy — repeating certain questions like whether I had fun and asking if I was leaving . He kept trying to figure out exactly where I was, like he didn’t want to miss the chance to see me. Earlier that week, he had already joked about being my “new rave buddy” when I sent him screenshots of upcoming DJ sets, but hearing him say it in person felt bold and very real.

When I finally reached him, security wouldn’t let me back into the crowd. And this man — who avoids confrontation — stepped forward and talked to the security guard to sort it out so we could have a moment. When everything settled, I told him I was glad to see him and then he opened his arms and softly said, “come here,” and hugged me. He’s not a hugger at all, so feeling him give me a warm, intentional hug completely surprised me. Then he looked at me and said, “Next time at the rave, we’re staying next to each other,” pointing with his finger like he meant every word.

Since that night, we haven’t texted much — but he’s never been a texting guy at all. He expresses everything in person, through presence and small moments, not long chats. I’ll be going to his branch again soon for some work, and we actually have another rave the same week, which feels like insane timing. After all the slow buildup — the number, the music, the wife jokes, the mug in his cabinet, the three-week gap, him asking where I’ve been, the rave, him searching for me, the call, the hug, and the “next time we stay together” comment — I’m just trying to figure out if this is a real slow-burn connection or just my mind connecting dots.

I don’t want to push, but I also don’t want to pretend nothing is happening. I’d really appreciate insight from anyone who’s dealt with this kind of quiet, in-person, slow-burn guy.

I’d do periods of sobriety, then try to moderate again, rinse and repeat. However, I found out I am pregnant a few days ago so now I obviously can’t drink - it’s just not up for any mind gymnastics or negotiation. I’ve been pregnant before and had no problem not drinking then. However, that pregnancy was very planned and this one is well… a surprise lol (still the baby is welcome and will be born into a happy and stable family).

I’m finding it a bit more difficult to navigate this huge surprise and change sober. Of course a big life change like this brings up a lot of feelings good and bad, and up until this week I would have had a few glasses of wine to wind down in a heightened state like this (I had fallen off my sobriety stint again). The prospect of at least 9 months with not a drop of alcohol during Christmas and other holidays is also making me feel a bit panicky. I know it’s stupid because my goal was always to quit drinking anyway, and this is a great opportunity to see it through. But I’m also just stressing out a bit and have to find other ways to relax (in addition to no alcohol, no hot baths, not too much of my favourite tea or coffee, no calming supplements/cbd, etc..). 

Just wanted to share and ask has anyone been in a similar situation, and what worked for you? I want to reiterate that I am absolutely not going to drink throughout my pregnancy and work hard to stay sober afterwards too.

1p4x661,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p4x661,Sugarplum Island WIP #2,"Another motivation post, plus sharing some game pictures. Got routing solid for pre-testing, popped some houses and lots in from Disko ( [https://forums.ea.com/discussions/the-sims-3-creative-corner-en/scrapped-disko-island--caw-files-uploaded/2322279/](https://forums.ea.com/discussions/the-sims-3-creative-corner-en/scrapped-disko-island--caw-files-uploaded/2322279/) ) to set the tone for a few areas, moved a dozen sims in, and started building. 

Finding it gorgeous (a little biased here). Feels less open, and more mysterious, than the Harbor, even if it's the same size. This feels like a world where a PI can hang out in a seedy office, then jet up to a ritzy manor to take a case, then head down to the wharfs to get info, if that makes sense.

Sims are a mix of long-dead Harbor sims, 7th or 8th gen Harbor sims who never had a chance to shine/died too early, and newly generated role sims who got promotions. My founder is Valentine Dulcet, a wealthy Loner Bookworm who has never needed to grow up, because his butler Porter takes care of everything for him.

Areas: The historic town, sort of 1880s with old west/new orleans vibes, a hub for the miners and sailors. This sort of bleeds into the business district, built up over decades of shipping trade, which in turn leads into the main suburbs, old enough to be dated. Closer to the cliffs is the palatial Overlook Fields, where the Calissons and Melysions have their estates and their feud. Heading towards the hills you'll find the remains of the old mining town, and the quarry lake. Above is a lovely vinyard on the left, and a tiny tidy Victorian town on the right. Some farmhouses, and a fun science area/ranger area, up in the mountains. And of course three separate small marinas. :D

There are roughly 60 commercial lots (most unbuilt) and 84 residential (20 unbuilt but most are from Disko). I'm using Jynx rugs and rabbithole doors, I've never used the ""real"" rabbit holes so I don't know how that'd work out. My focus is on making each lot valuable and worth visiting in play. The island is small, and I want the vibe to reflect that most people quietly handle their own business, with a handshake, a polite agreement, or a fist fight.

So far built: bistro, maker space (college of art), city hall/coffee shop/journalism, bookstore/police/laundromat, science/college of science, junkyard, criminal hideout. School house, festival lot, gardens/wedding venue. Dive bar. Dance club, flea market, farmer's market, gym, fire station.

The world itself has no CC. Expansions (that I know of, I run with all) if you want all the trees: 7 (Supernatural) & 11 (Into the Future, for a few aspen and decorative beech, can probably skip it). I think the Distant Terrain is from University but I'm not sure, I'll check it when I load up CAW to add more trees.

Maxis makes it hard to get real grunge (you've got faux-decrepit and cheerful 00s), so I'm likely going to do a grunge/wear pass using some more CC at some point. This is a preliminary list, subject to change (just found an absolutely amazing caravan/container build set, and one for exposed painted brick, hazards of looking up all these links). I mostly just wanted to share my favorites. :)

In play I'm also using Arsil's toddler mat and generic role marker, Twinsimming's yoga and jogging, and some store content (wood burning oven, sun windows, stuff like that). I'll probably remove a lot of that at the final pass.

Still have quite a bit to build, and redo (some of the Disko houses have very blocky internals that don't do justice to the lovely exteriors), but having fun with it. Now I have to go revamp the graveyard, as my Sim bought it yesterday, and I had no idea you have to have a certain dollar amount to open it for business.

1p4x616,https://www.reddit.com/r/Needafriend/comments/1p4x616/f23_and_going_through_a_rough_friendship_breakup/,f23 and going through a rough friendship breakup,"I'm feeling really alone right now. To make a long story short – one of my best friends got a new job in March/April and completely stopped talking to me. We would speak every day, he'd come over all the time, etc. I expected this for the first couple of months, but then it never got better. Until May or june, he would ignore my messages and claim he was busy with work but would hang out with other people. In July, I saw him in person and told him how much I missed him and asked if he wanted to get coffee the next day, since I was going to be in his neighbourhood. he said yes and then never showed. Now, i've heard rumblings of him reaching out to some of our mutual friends and spending time with them again, but not me. I decided to say something. 

I asked him if everything was okay and whether I had done something wrong; he simply replied that he was still busy with work. I replied, saying that I understand how hard it is adapting to a new hectic schedule, but it just isn't normal to not talk to one of your close friends for 6 months. He never replied. A week later, I realised he had restricted me/blocked me from his instagram stories, and so I told him how disappointing and hurtful this was, and he replied quite explosively. He said everything was my fault, said I'd invalidated him, ignored him, dismissed his struggles, etc., and basically exploded once I held him accountable. i replied with something like, 'i don't appreciate you speaking to me this way,' or something like that, and left it. Told one of our friends and one of my very close friends about the situation simply because a) i needed to tell someone, and b) she is having a birthday soon and we are both invited, and she responded saying she doesn't want to get involved and that she is seeing him next week for drinks. 

I'm gutted. I can't believe it. I feel really alone and I feel everyone choosing his side because he is fun, charismatic, and most importantly *lies*. I feel like I'm panicking, and I really want to talk to someone right now. How could my friends do this to me? How could they choose someone hurting me over me ?

I no longer experience any extreme hunger, I never skip meals, don't walk pointlessly for hours and my life is 5000X better than when I was in the depths of my illness. I never want to go back.

However, I feel like there's a wall stopping me to full freedom. Food noise consumes my every second, I negotiated a sort of deal with my brain that I can have 3 meals a day and a snack before bed. I'm not hungry- the meals I have I always ensure they are balanced, contain a fat source, carb source and protein source+ veg for fibre. I'm not restrictive in the way I prepare them, I do my best to follow recipes exactly. I still glance at calorie labels in shops, I ensure everything is ""not too little"" but also ""not too much"". I think I go through about a 50 pack of chewing gum a day to silence the food noise as well as artificially sweetened coffees, teas, squashes and colas. I eat out with my boyfriend at restaurants, but if I do there's still like mini rules that I can only have a big dinner if lunch is a little smaller.

I suppose I know I shouldn't have any rules. I've been through extreme hunger, ""binges"" which I know were just my body's response to scarcity. I just fear whats next. I don't really know where else to go. I eat well, my weight is back to normal and its stationary, but I still don't ""feel"" normal. Theres still a fear of gaining continuously, especially now I look and feel healthy. I just wish food didn't exist. I know I can't live my life like this but I honestly don't know. Do i redo all-in? I just feel like without structure I will overeat. Now i read this back I don't sound very recovered. I just don't know what to do. Whats next to get to freedom? :/",3,1763929678.0,AnorexiaRecovery,1,1.0,False

# Tl;dr: 

We had a really great time. Japanese infrastructure makes traveling with a kid easy, and in general, we felt very welcome to bring our baby into most spaces. Tons of people (especially women) loved interacting with our baby. The most challenging aspects of this trip were a) the long flight time (NYC->Tokyo), b) jetlag/sleep (takes a few days for baby to accommodate), and c) crowds (even being from NYC, high traffic train stations like Tokyo Station or Sapporo Station are really hectic and overwhelming, especially with a stroller.)



# Background

We live in NYC and we are well used to walking a lot with our baby (stroller and baby carrier), and by the six month mark we were used to taking him onto public transportation (with varying levels of accessibility, mostly inaccessible on the subway and only kind of accessible on buses).

We've also been to Japan before, and I took Japanese in uni ages ago, so I have some very basic conversational skills down. We chose Japan as our first big international family trip because we're comfortable with Tokyo, we wanted a robust public transportation system, and had been told by a few people it's a good choice for a trip with a baby. Happy to report that last part is true! Japanese infrastructure is so easy with a baby, and as I've told a few people, once you've climbed three stories with your 20lb baby in a carrier to get to the 7 train while your husband carries the diaper bag and folded up stroller, taking your kid onto a train in Japan (with a working elevator and reliable train schedule) is a piece of cake lol. 

  
Since we had been to Japan before (two full trips for me, one full trip for my husband, and two long layovers in Tokyo that we spent in different neighborhoods), we did not focus on the Golden Route, and were also not super concerned with packing in every tourist sight ever. We wanted to leisurely enjoy Hokkaido, a place we both talked about visiting for awhile, and get experience traveling with our son. (And also: eat and shop a LOT.) 



# Rough itinerary:

We kept our plans fluid - what we did was based on how good the baby felt that day, or what we thought he could handle. He was able to nap in the stroller and carrier, but not for long, so we made sure to try to get him a long nap in the morning or afternoon (he's currently doing 3 naps a day). 

**Tokyo**: We landed at Haneda early in the morning and took a direct train to the Higashi Ginza stop. We stayed at the Hyatt Centric because we had points. Great hotel, but wouldn't necessarily recommend Ginza as a base for Tokyo unless you're really, really into designer brands. We requested a crib, which the baby only slept in part of the time. 

What we did: Took it slow, did some shopping, met up with a friend at Ginza 6 for matcha parfaits, Glitch coffee, yakitori. 

**Aomori**: Shinkansen from Tokyo to Aomori. 2 nights here, stayed in a smaller hotel (ReLabo Medical Spa & Stay). Hotel was right on top of the station, and very convenient to what we wanted to see and do. 

What we did: A-factory, Nebuta Museum, lots of cute cafes, nokkedon at the seafood market, miso butter curry ramen (!). ReLabo is a really nice spa hotel, and we were able to reserve a private onsen (one of us held the baby while the other took a dip). The hotel also had public onsens, which we both used.

**Hakodate**: Shinkansen from Aomori to Hakodate. Stayed at Villa Concordia, which I highly recommend - our room was really large, and had a crib, a little kitchenette which was useful for sterilizing bottles, and a free laundry room. Spent 3 nights here. We really loved our time in Hakodate, and pre-baby, this pace might've been too slow for us - we probably could've sped through Hakodate in 1-2 days. But with a baby, being able to slowly see sights, eat good food, and relax in a big hotel room was so lovely. Also, our hotel had incredible breakfast sets every day, a beautiful view of Hakodate, and super sweet and accommodating staff. 

What we did: Hakodate morning market, Motomachi district, Mt. Hakodate ropeway at night, Kanemori Red Brick Warehouses, Lucky Pierrot (of course), really cute Russian cafe called Marutamogaya, grilled our own dango at Sabo Kikuimuzi

**Sapporo**: Train (Hokuto Express) from Hakodate to Sapporo. Stayed at the La'gent in Odori for 3 nights. Coslept in a huge king bed. Can't say much about the hotel - it got the job done, but not with a lot of charm. However, it had a public onsen, and a low cost laundry room.

What we did: Our itinerary kind of fell apart in Sapporo - I was too tired from a night of rough sleep to do a planned day trip to Otaru, and the other day we had planned for Sapporo Beer Factory or walking around Hokkaido University was too cold and snowy to take the baby out. We still had a good time shopping and eating in Sapporo - SO much good food here. I really love miso ramen (used to frequent Misoya in the East Village back in the day, for those who know), and we tried different styles of soup curry (sooo great on cold winter days). Had some really delicious cups of coffee at Node and Mermaid. And of course: tons of dairy, in pretty much every form. 

**Tokyo**: Flight from Sapporo to Tokyo. 3 nights here back at the Hyatt Centric.

What we did: Mostly shopping, met with local friends in Shimokita one day to walk around, and another set of friends at our hotel bar the last night. Went to a really lovely little Italian place called Howlin' for dinner one night - sweetest staff ever with a really cool vibe. Had a leisurely and delicious meal, highballs, and even had the pleasure of changing our baby in the tiniest bathroom ever lol (they didn't mind, and our bartender was a super sweet woman who talked a lot to our baby). Peeped at some secondhand designer bag shops near our hotel - I was considering investing in a purse, but didn't end up doing it but it was just fun to see what they had in stock. 



# Specifics:

**Resources**: Tablelog (for reservations), Mamapapamap (to find changing stations - I never used it, because tbh they were in every department store or train station), Tokyo Chapter blog (more useful for older kids imo but still nice to read).

  
**Illness**: I was really worried about getting the flu or COVID while in Japan, especially because I misunderstood the vaccine scheduling and was only able to get our baby his flu and COVID shots a few days before departure. In case you haven't heard, Japan is having a major flu epidemic right now, and EVERYONE was coughing/sneezing/sniffling on the trains. Older men in particular loved to hack up a lung without masking/covering their mouths. Baby got the sniffles a few days into the trip, but no fever, was eating fine, and he wasn't particularly fussy. Snot sucker was invaluable here. We still have time to develop the flu, since we just arrived back yesterday, but crossing my fingers that we somehow dodged it with masking/avoiding large crowds when possible/saline drops and snot sucking for the baby.



**Weather**: This part of November wasn't the most ""ideal"" time for Hokkaido (missed peak fall foliage, cold, but not super snowy like winter tourists want) - however, we're used to shitty weather being in NYC, we got some beautiful fall days nonetheless, and our baby even experienced his first snow in Sapporo! It doesn't snow as much in NYC anymore so it was a treat for us, even though it meant super icy sidewalks the next day (NOT fun to lug a stroller and suitcases on). 



**IC cards**: We both have (non-Japanese) Androids - this meant we can't use digital IC cards. We both bought Passmos at the station in Haneda. You will need to reload these with cash which is annoying. 

  
**Trains**: Both shinkansens we were on had a nursing room. The Hokuto Express did not have a nursing room, but it did have a changing table in the toilet. We found out very quickly that our kid has trouble sleeping on us now because he's too big to be comfortable - baby carrying him to sleep was key. Both JR stops and regular subway stops all seemed to have working elevators, but give yourself time to navigate the station to find where the elevators are, because the signage is a little confusing at times.



**Luggage forwarding**: We pack very light (reformed one bagger here), but baby stuff took up a ton of room, and we wanted to bring back a lot of souvenirs - we brought two roller suitcases, two travel backpacks, and a small diaper backpack. Luggage forwarding was KEY here. You do not want to be lugging around tons of roller suitcases in addition to a stroller. Takes 2-3 days between destinations (especially if traveling between islands). I brought a packable duffel, and we ended up getting another duffel from Muji for our clothing purchases. If I were to do this again, I would just bring one or two full sized suitcases instead of all the backpacks/duffels. Our hotels handled the luggage forwarding -we just filled out the forms. 



**Formula**: Our baby is combo fed, but my supply has been slowly dropping and he gets 50-70% of his feeds from formula these days. I brought a can of Kendamil and two of those ByHeart travel packs to Japan. The ByHeart travel packs got recalled for infant botulism (!!!) a few days into our trip. I doom spiraled about our kid having botulism for a day or two, then switched to buying Japanese formula to supplement our Kendamil. 

  
Note: It's really hard to find varieties of formulas, diapers, etc. in most central locations of Tokyo or other cities. You won't have a lot of choice. I ended up buying a few different types of formula because we used more than anticipated, which luckily my baby was fine with. [This](https://tinytotintokyo.com/baby-formula-in-japan-best-brands-types-and-where-to-buy-it) is a good guide to different kinds of formula you might find in Japan. You can purchase formula at drugstores (like Matsumoto Kiyoshi, which should be most places in Tokyo; Sapporo had their own drugstore brands).

  
Brands I tried and had success with: 

* BeanStalk Sukoyaka Stick type formula (wish we had stocked up on more of these, they're so handy to shove into a diaper bag)
* ICREO Carton type (ready made)
* Meiji Hohoemi can type (ready made) 

  
**Baby Food**: Our baby is only just starting solids, so we brought some peanut snacks to continue allergen exposure, and he tried a little yogurt and banana on the trip. You can find baby food pouches in the drugstores, but I didn't want to mess with food introduction on the trip.

**Diapers**: I really wish we had just packed two weeks worth of Pampers Swaddlers**.** We were using [Merries](https://tinytotintokyo.com/reviewing-newborn-diapers-in-japan) size L pull ups, and they are just not absorbent enough. Our kid had sooo many blowouts in these, and a few times where pee leaked through the diaper despite not being on very long. Maybe these would be more effective on a smaller baby - but our chunky 90th percentile kid needs American diapers lol.

  
**Other baby supplies**: Can find limited varieties of baby wipes, bottles, teether toys, etc. in the drugstore too. We were not a fan of the wipes we bought in Japan either; wish we had just packed a bunch of our own since we found we had to use way more of them to get our baby clean.



**Dining**: This depends on your baby's temperament, but we were able to eat at a larger variety of places than we originally thought. No smoky izakayas, nothing super hip or fancy, but we ate at tons of tiny restaurants, cafes, and kissatens - did lots of ramen, yakitori, unagidon, soup curry, fancy coffee, sushi (even did an omakase our last day - used Tableog to scout that one out). Had some struggle meals in department stores (depato) as last resorts, and of course, tons of konbini when needed (usually during travel days or desperation meals). Baby carriers are your best friend here, since a lot of places are way too small for strollers, though there were a few times we were able to leave strollers at the front of the restaurant and just eat inside (we saw Japanese parents do this often). If you want to ask if babies are ok, you can say ""akachan wa daijobu desu ka?"" No one ever told us no, but we also were smart about where to go. Hokkaido was especially welcoming to children imo, though people in Tokyo were perfectly nice about bringing a child into places as well. 

  
**Nursing rooms**: Man, these are a godsend. Just having good changing tables in a big enough space that both of us could fit in was so helpful. Pretty much any department store (or big shopping complex) will have a changing room area, if not a full nursing room setup. 

  
**Laundry**: We really lucked out with two of our hotels having laundry rooms, instead of laundry service. We had a lot of blowouts, and while I brought detergent to handwash clothes if needed, it was so much easier to just pop baby clothes and our own sweaty travel clothes into a machine. Dryers are not super efficient, so we had to hang dry some of the laundry for a day to fully dry out. 

  
**Airline**: ANA is incredible. We fucked up pretty badly on our flight from Sapporo to Tokyo - didn't realize we had to book an infant seat, which we found out going through security (about 10 minutes before the flight was going to start preboarding; our train journey from Sapporo to New Chitose Airport had taken longer than we thought). The ANA agent assigned the infant seat to us SO quickly and efficiently - if it were up to any American airline we'd probably still be stuck in Sapporo. You also get a little gift for your kid (puzzle set, wooden plane toy, etc.). For both international legs, we were in premium economy and had a bassinet. Having a 20lb lap infant for a 14 hour flight would NOT have been fun. 

  
**Flight tips**: Our baby did incredible on both international legs. He actually slept in the bassinet, and for times he wouldn't, I baby carried him to sleep. The best tip we got was to leave at night so the baby will sleep, which worked for our departure, but coming back, we flew during the day. We managed to occupy the baby with spinner toys, crinkle books, and silly faces, but I can tell that even in a month or two, he won't be as calm. There was one bathroom with a changing table, and both of us went to help with diaper changes (one to carry the baby, the other carried the supplies). I bottle fed during takeoff and landing to help with ear popping. I baby carried during takeoff and landing as well, since babies can't be in the bassinet during takeoff, landing, or turbulence.



# VIP baby supplies on this trip: 

* Our Uppababy Minu v2 stroller was a godsend, but I would not do a stroller any bigger than this - will be impossible to navigate onto trains and through ticket gates otherwise. 
* Stroller footmuff and baby carrier winter cover 
* Baby carrier (both of us find the Hope & Plum Lark really comfortable) 
* Portable sound machine (Hatch)
* Doggy poop bags (for diapers on the go, and to shove blowout clothes into if needed)
* Infant Tylenol / Motrin for teething or fevers 
* Electric snot sucker and saline drops
* Portable bottle drying rack with brush (Munchkin brand) 



I hope this report helps someone! If you're thinking of traveling to Japan with a baby, we had a lovely time, and couldn't recommend it more. But it definitely was still really challenging - and if we had a more difficult baby, I'm not sure if we would've had as successful of a trip. But I'm really glad we did it! And we can't wait to bring him back to Japan when he's older :) ",2,1763929574.0,JapanTravel,0,1.0,False

1p4wzgd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p4wzgd,Removed the coating inside my Ember,"Good day!

Not sure how the community will react, but I was going through my cupboard and I found my first ember mug. I had stopped using it years ago because the coating was coming off and I didn't feel good about it flaking into whatever was in my mug (I use it for coffee, tea and hot water). I remember the tragic story in reaching out to support within a few weeks of the warranty expiring. But support reached out to me after the warranty expired and told me I was out of warranty (grrrrr) but gave me a massive discount on a new one. So I got a new one.

Fast forward a few years, I see my old Ember mug and decided to see how wide spread this is. Turns out it's more common than I thought. Then I read how some people just removed the coating as it's just stainless steel underneath the coating (that is reportedly non toxic). I still didn't feel good about the coating coming off, so I went ahead removed the coating. As I never saw any pictures, I figured I would share. I used an abrasive wire brush and a power drill to remove the coating. Next step is use some fine grit sand paper to touch it up and get rid of the coating near the top. Though I may just get a porta via lid. Still cheaper than getting a new one (not that I would buy from Ember again).

1p4wy1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitnessplates/comments/1p4wy1u/lifepro_vibration_plate_machines_full_body_workout/,Lifepro Vibration Plate Machines – Full Body Workout,"Let’s be real, we’ve all had those days where hitting the gym feels like a mission to Mars. Between work, family, and the daily chaos of life, squeezing in a solid workout sometimes just doesn’t happen. That’s where the **Lifepro Vibration Plate Machine** swoops in like a tiny fitness superhero. I’m not saying it’s magic, but it’s pretty darn close. Imagine getting a **full-body workout** just by standing, sitting, or squatting on a platform that vibrates. Sounds too good to be true, right? Let’s talk about why this little machine might just change how you think about fitness.

# What Is the Lifepro Vibration Plate Machine?

So, let’s start with the basics. The **Lifepro Vibration Plate** is a compact platform that uses **high-frequency vibrations** to engage your muscles. Basically, it makes your muscles contract multiple times per second while you balance on it. You can use it for toning, strength training, or even recovery.

Now, before you think it’s just a fancy foot massager (I thought that too at first), trust me—it’s way more powerful than it looks. You can perform all kinds of exercises on it: squats, lunges, planks, or just stand still and let the machine do the micro work. And it’s *actually effective*. Ever tried doing squats on a moving surface? Your legs will definitely know.

# How It Works (The Fun Science Bit)

Alright, let’s get slightly nerdy for a second—but don’t worry, I’ll keep it simple. When you stand or move on the Lifepro vibration plate, it **sends gentle vibrations** through your body. Your muscles respond automatically by tightening and relaxing quickly to stabilize you.

In short: it’s like tricking your body into thinking you’re doing a more intense workout than you actually are. Not bad, huh?

It’s called **whole-body vibration training**, and it’s been around for decades—NASA even used it to help astronauts maintain muscle mass in zero gravity. So yeah, if it’s good enough for astronauts, it’s probably good enough for us earthlings trying to get fit in our living rooms.

# Key Features That Actually Matter

Let’s talk features—the stuff that makes this machine worth the hype.

* **Full Body Activation** – It targets every muscle group from head to toe. You’ll feel it in your legs, core, arms, and even those tiny stabilizer muscles you didn’t know existed.
* **Customizable Speed Settings** – Whether you’re just starting out or you’re already a fitness junkie, you can adjust the vibration intensity to your comfort level.
* **Compact Design** – Fits right under your bed or couch. No excuses about not having space.
* **Bonus Resistance Bands** – Many models come with **resistance bands** for extra arm and shoulder workouts.
* **Built-in Display + Remote** – You can track your speed, time, and vibration intensity. No complicated apps or tech setup needed (thank goodness).

The machine even comes with **pre-programmed workout modes**, so if you don’t want to think about what to do, just press start and follow along.

# The Benefits: Why People Swear by It

You might wonder, “Okay, but what does it *really* do?” Fair question. Here’s a quick rundown of the benefits you can expect with consistent use:

* **Improved Muscle Tone:** It strengthens and tones muscles without lifting heavy weights.
* **Better Circulation:** Those vibrations help boost blood flow, which can make recovery faster and reduce soreness.
* **Increased Flexibility:** Your body adapts to constant micro-movements, improving your range of motion.
* **Fat Burning Boost:** The vibration forces your body to stabilize constantly, meaning more calorie burn in less time.
* **Improved Balance and Coordination:** Perfect for seniors or anyone who wants better control and posture.

And yes, it even helps with **lymphatic drainage**, which is a fancy way of saying it helps your body flush out toxins. Who doesn’t love a bonus detox?

# My Personal Experience

Alright, story time. I was super skeptical when I first saw one of these. I thought, “A plate that shakes you into shape? Yeah, right.” But after a week of using it while watching Netflix, I started noticing my legs and abs actually felt tighter. The best part? It doesn’t feel like you’re punishing yourself.

You can use it while watching TV, scrolling through your phone, or even during a coffee break. It’s like a **lazy person’s dream workout** (I mean that in the best way). And once I started adding a few squats and push-ups on it, things got *real*. My muscles burned faster than they would in a normal session.

# Comparison: Lifepro vs Other Vibration Plates

There are plenty of vibration plates on the market, but **Lifepro** tends to stand out for a few solid reasons:

* **Durability:** It feels sturdy, not like it’ll break if you accidentally step on the edge.
* **Noise Level:** Some cheaper models sound like a jackhammer. Lifepro’s machines are surprisingly quiet.
* **Customer Support:** Lifepro’s warranty and support actually deliver. They even include access to training videos.
* **Variety:** They have models ranging from beginner-friendly to advanced, like the Waver, Turbo, or Rumblex series.

If you’re serious about quality and longevity, I’d say the Lifepro beats most budget brands hands down.

# Who Should Try It?

This machine isn’t just for gym-goers. It’s for:

* **Busy people** who can’t always make time for the gym.
* **Seniors** who want gentle yet effective movement.
* **Athletes** looking to enhance recovery and balance.
* **Beginners** who want to start working out without the intimidation factor.

Basically, anyone with a body can benefit. Whether you’re trying to get fit, tone up, or just loosen stiff muscles after a long day, it adapts to your level.

# Tips for Using It Effectively

Let me drop a few quick tips so you get the best results:

1. **Start Slow:** Begin with short sessions (10–15 minutes) at lower speeds.
2. **Mix in Exercises:** Add squats, lunges, or planks to increase intensity.
3. **Stay Consistent:** Like anything, results come with regular use.
4. **Hydrate:** You’ll sweat more than you expect!
5. **Use It Barefoot:** This helps engage your stabilizing muscles more effectively.

And here’s a pro tip: play your favorite playlist during the session. Time flies when you’re vibing (literally).

# Final Thoughts

So, is the **Lifepro Vibration Plate Machine** worth it? IMO, 100% yes. It’s compact, easy to use, and surprisingly effective for something that fits under your couch. You can work out your entire body in a fraction of the time and still feel the burn.

Whether you want to tone up, boost circulation, or just sneak in a quick workout while watching your favorite show, this thing delivers. Plus, it’s perfect for all ages and fitness levels.

Think of it as your personal mini gym that doesn’t complain, doesn’t take up space, and doesn’t charge monthly fees. Sounds like a win to me :)

I felt like a fool standing in the middle of the trail staring off into the forest. I had carefully mapped my route and knew this was the exact right place I needed to be. All I had to do was step off the trail and make my way down the slope of the hill. The place I had camped out that day with my father and Leroy was little more than a half mile in front of me.

It would be *so easy* to just do it, but I couldn’t. I hadn’t seen another soul on the trails. I hadn’t even seen a trace of anyone since I left Jen at the trailhead. There was no reason for the anxiety welling up inside of me, but it had paralyzed me nonetheless. I had hiked for miles in order to get here and I couldn’t compel myself to follow through.

I quietly cursed to myself as I turned away and got moving again. I couldn’t push the thought out of my mind that the rangers might check in on me. All of the gear I was carrying probably tipped Jen off and I wasn’t going to be caught out for one stupid mistake. I’d come too far to be undone by a pretty girl I couldn’t shut my mouth around.

It was going to take hours to hike the whole trail back to my site. It would be exhausting and difficult even despite my physical fitness. I was throwing an entire day away and putting myself on the back foot going forward. I just couldn’t shake the feeling that it was the right move to make.

I tried to clear my mind and use the hike to get myself back into the right mentality for what needed to be done. Instead, I wound up on an unpleasant trip down memory lane. After all, there was no part of this place where I didn’t have some recollection of time spent with my father. Ghosts of my past moved down the trails and through the forest around me.

It would have been overwhelming if it wasn’t for the fondness of the memories. Besides that one place, I had nothing but love for the park. Still, like a cancer, the darkness of one night crept in and began to destroy the illusion cast by rose tinted glasses. As I continued on, I found myself in places where I had tread with Leroy as a child. Wandering the familiar trails, sentimentality began to die a slow death, replaced by hollowness as memories turned more bitter with each step.

Melancholy transformed into sorrow before I knew it. I found myself shivering against the cold wind and wondering what awful fate befell my friend. They had never found so much as a trace of him. Despite the efforts of the rangers, the sheriff’s department, and search and rescue, he had simply disappeared. It had been around this time of year when he went missing and the conclusion was that he had likely succumbed to the elements and been taken by wildlife.

Of course, I had always known better. The authorities had believed that he had simply wandered off in the night while my father and I were sleeping. They concluded that he must have gotten lost. It had always been such a ridiculous dismissal to me– even when I was still young enough not to question those same authorities. Leroy wasn’t as experienced as me, but he had learned a lot from my father.

Even if I hadn’t awoken that night and heard what I had, it wouldn’t have sat right with me. He had been missing all of eight or so hours when the rangers had arrived at our camp. He couldn’t have gotten far and certainly would have left tracks or other signs as he moved through the woods. More importantly, he was dressed for the weather and his sleeping bag was gone along with him.

That fact came up, but it hadn’t been considered tangible evidence when my father was investigated. The lawyer the Watsons had retained used it in the civil case, but even the judge didn’t believe my father was responsible for his disappearance. There was no evidence that he had left the site either, so the only conclusion that could be drawn was that it was his negligence which resulted in Leroy’s disappearance and presumed death. Though, none of that mattered in the court of public opinion.

No one had ever considered the evidence that I had become obsessed with. The surrounding area had been canvassed for human and animal activity, but they dismissed the latter rather quickly. Perhaps a little too quickly, I always believed, but mostly because the tear on the tent had also been ignored. It had always been considered damage caused by Leroy during his exit from the tent.

That was perhaps the one thing that I most questioned. It was an angle that the public defender who represented my father had taken. He had suggested that Leroy had been either sleepwalking or suffering some sort of nocturnal delusion which caused him to tear open the tent rather than unzip it. Somehow, the investigating deputies gave supporting testimony to this notion and ultimately secured my father’s innocence in the initial criminal investigation.

A part of me had always looked at the investigation as a whole as the consequence of rural policing and lack of sympathy for the victim. I was resentful of every party involved for an incredibly long time. As I grew older, I realized that my resentment stemmed from a heartbreaking truth: there was simply not enough evidence to seek justice for Leroy. Malice or even incompetence was unlikely as a hinge pin for the case. If they had been, I doubted my father would be a free man.

I stopped in the middle of the trail and heaved out a deep, frustrated sigh. I wondered what my therapist would have to say about all of this. Dropping out of my whole life back in Texas to wander through childhood memories and torment myself with the facets of a missing person’s case couldn’t be healthy. Then again, I wondered if this is what she meant by closure. I’m sure a reasonable person would try to reconnect with an estranged relative and attempt to make peace with a traumatic experience. That wasn’t really what I was doing, though.

All roads lead back to the Howler for me. I couldn’t get through a single day without it haunting me. Ostensibly, I was a successful adult with a good education and career, but that was all that I had. Though I appeared polished and accomplished, beneath the surface lay an overwhelming loneliness, a life void of friendships, where colleagues brushed past like fleeting shadows. I hadn’t ever had a successful relationship, constantly finding myself left on read after they figured out who I really was past the thin veneer of normalcy.

I couldn’t make it through the night without nightmares waking me in a cold sweat. I was obsessed with the past and kept extensive files about what had happened to Leroy and my father. The coffee table in the living room of my apartment had multiple books on cryptids and American Folklore. My bookshelves were full of copies of missing persons books and similar material. Anyone who spent more than a professional amount of time with me could see I wasn’t normal.

This journey to Devil’s Den only solidified that fact to myself. I wasn’t sure if I was mad or just foolish, but the self-conscious reflection didn’t assuage my desire to continue. I withdrew the GPS from my pocket with a needless amount of effort. My frustration at allowing myself to get lost in thought and, consequently, lost in the woods caused me to fumble it. I caught it before it could hit the ground, saving me from that potential disaster.

My heart sank as I realized I had been traveling in the completely wrong direction from my campsite. Chasing the memories through the woods had led me wildly astray and now it was going to cost me. The sun had fallen below the half-bare tree branches overhead and I probably had an hour and a half hike to my destination. I was going to wind up pitching my tent in darkness and it was unlikely that I would get any rest during the night anyway.

Knowing this, I took a look around and found a suitable rock on the edge of the trail to act as a seat. I pulled my backpack off and set it on the ground so that I could get off my feet comfortably. I dropped onto it with a decided lack of grace before bracing my elbows against my knees, leaning forward, and putting my head in my hands. I needed this, even if it would eat up some of the last daylight I had left to work with.

I was too stressed to keep going. My head was full of discordant thoughts running rampant. I tried to focus on my breathing, slowly inhaling through my nose and out of my mouth. I began to rub my temples methodically, and in the process my thoughts began to slowly erode into stillness of mind. The process was a familiar one and, perhaps, the only truly useful thing I felt I had taken away from therapy. It was the only way I could recover from the nightmares which plagued me.

When I finally felt under control again, I sat upright and opened my eyes to the world around me. Dusk had transformed the sky into a shade of burgundy above the trees and the waning light of day was filtering through the blazing foliage overhead. I felt numb, staring out at scenery that used to bring me such joy. That detachment allowed me to consider the bigger picture once more. I had lost a day, but it gave me the opportunity to move past the emotional hurdles that were inevitably going to inhibit me.

I stood up and retrieved my bag. A moment later, I had it strapped to my back again. Then I was able to get moving in the right direction. As the sun set and I found myself in darkness, nearing my destination, I allowed myself to think again. I decided that I wasn’t going to falter again tomorrow. I was going to go through with my plan regardless of what the day brought.",1,1763929429.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Upon forcing myself to do these things (the day of it being due of course) I get this slight but day-long feeling (which I have as of this moment) of someone pinching my head between my temples, and I get snappy and escalate simple conversation into arguments extremely quickly because I always think that people showing curiosity in my life is them interrogating me to find something wrong about me. But today, the lack of motivation is gone. I got out of bed and got coffee and donuts. I've been doing work and started laundry and finally have the motivation to shower for the first time in 3 days. I can tell I still have the feelings of being on edge especially in conversation with loved ones, but I am doing things that need to be done with no mental block and it feels great.

I am not on medication for ADHD or even diagnosed as of yet, but I have family history of ADHD, depression, and anxiety and I think recent change I have experienced in going to college and having responsibility to carry out daily has exacerbated my loss of motivation that I would only rarely have in high school because I didn't have anything to do except play games all day.

Hello again!

I bring you the second (two out of two) commission I asked the talented Orniris to do for me. This time it’s one of my all time fav mediums - the Hammerhead. If you notice this one’s got the same merc symbol - but a keen eye will notice Ice Hellion symbology. That is because this pilot specifically was caught during a disastrous sortie from her Ice Hellion Galaxy that belongs to the Scorpion Empire. She eventually now. It was a rough road (and a short story I’m working on), but she now pilots her same Hammerhead she was caught in for Bojack’s Horsemen.

This piece I asked for a much more brighter morning with her sipping coffee - and honestly Orniris delivered as per normal. 

He also saw some of your feedback on the ladder of the regent being a bit weird - so he actually went back and redrew the ladder a bit wider with less rungs - I included the new and improved pics in this post (I think the ladder looks better now what y’all think ❤️). I’m super glad I was able to commission these two pieces of artwork from him - both being a slight break from his normal character driven work and this being more environmental/atmospheric in nature. 

For those curious - here is his page on Instagram (mostly focused on character images from warhammer - but as you can see his battletech is phenomenal). Anyways - enjoy

(On Facebook messenger), until I asked her if she wanted to chat over coffee to get get to know her better.

Background on her: Extremely religious posts about Jesus 3 times a day and nothing else. (Obviously this isnt a bad thing by itself as it could be perceived as good)

She said that yes she would meetup with me for coffee somtime"" just say when"". I asked her follow up question  and it took her like an hour and a half to respond about whether she was going to church tommorow, (because I wanted to schedule coffee for after church), and she finally responded:

""Yes Jesus is my everything""

 and left me on read for the rest of the night.

The breaks in conversation became longer after I showed interest. 

I sensed some resentment and on her part, and I wonder if shes actually emotionally available for dating.

I can tell she is extremely religious, to be honest I took offense to her lack on enthusiasm and being left on read last night, I mean after all, it took me some gut to muster up the question and I dont appreciate being left on read for the rest of the night.

Tbh I blocked her on Facebook because it turned me off to the point where I think I have my answer just thought I'd share because as a guy in these modern times its hard for us to try asking someone out in the first place, the risk is high and the feminist movement is always trying to emasculate men.

As a man all I ask for is honesty, but some women can't speak honesty for fear retribution for rejection I'm sure. I'm not the type to fear rejections, I embrace them because I feel that to never try is the bigger fail.

The last 2 months I have not been able to properly digest ANYTHING. I had an endoscopy a few weeks ago, and they found nothing except minor acid damage. So they put me on a medication that has been helping and i got too comfortable. I was able to see my friends for 2 hours last week, and i have managed to go to dinner and not get ill immediately after once.

So, I made the mistake that I’m sure you all are familiar with. I dared to go to the store and try to go to thanksgiving in the same day. Also drank a coffee. (Dumb) 

So about half hour ago I started getting malaise and had to run to the restroom. I was in there with diarrhea for like 15 minutes, and other people started needing the toilet so when I was done I grabbed my purse and ran out the door. 

Luckily, I live literally a few streets over, so no mess in my car.

I called my bf to tell him what happened and he seemed frustrated with me. Also tried to call my mom and step dad and neither picked up. 

I’m just embarrassed, and I’m already kinda the black sheep of the family. I miss a lot cuz big events are overwhelming and I’m always sick or going through mental health challenges. I’m awkward and always uncomfortable and always struggling to not be a downer.

Last week, our team had a late-night deadline. Just me and one colleague — someone I’ve always admired quietly. She’s confident in a very calm way, the kind that makes the whole room feel lighter. We were never exactly close, just friendly enough to share coffee breaks and complain about Monday mornings.

The night stretched longer than expected. Everyone else had left hours earlier. It was just us, laptops glowing, the office unusually silent. Around 1:40 AM, the building power tripped for a few seconds — everything went dark except the emergency lights.

She laughed, nervously, and said, “Why do these things happen only when we’re alone?”

I don’t know what shifted in that moment. Maybe it was the exhaustion. Maybe it was months of unspoken chemistry. But the atmosphere changed. She sat next to me instead of across the table. Our conversation drifted from work into life… and then into things we’d never shared with anyone at work.

At one point, she told me,
“You always pretend you’re okay. But you’re the kind of person who carries everything alone, aren’t you?”

No one had ever said something like that to me. Not with that kind of softness.

I don’t know who leaned in first. But the space between us disappeared so naturally, so quietly, that it felt like it was always supposed to happen. It wasn’t reckless or wild — just intensely… real. Like something we’d both been avoiding for too long.

Nothing explicit happened — just closeness way beyond what colleagues should share. Her head on my chest. My hand in her hair. Her whispering things I’m still thinking about.

When the lights came back, we moved away instantly, like reality had just walked back into the room.

We didn’t speak about it afterwards. Not a word.

This week she’s kept things… normal. A little too normal. Like she’s trying to erase that night by pretending it never happened.

And I’m stuck between wanting to respect her space… and wanting to relive that moment again.

I don’t know if I crossed a line.
I don’t know if she regrets it.
I don’t know what this means now.

But it’s been a week and I can’t stop thinking about her.
About us.
About that silence before the lights came back on.

I don’t know what I’m expecting by writing this — maybe just a perspective I can’t give myself.

FWIW I've had lifelong symptoms of MCAS/EDS/POTS, but wasn't diagnosed or treated sooner in life because of parental medical neglect, and I honest to god just didn't know these symptoms of POTS and physical traits of EDS weren't normal. I am diagnosed with chronic migraines though that i've had since I was 5yo, which are CLEARING UP with the antihistamine routine. The antihistamines are controlling my migraines better than any rescue medication has EVER.

Anyways, I don't know how it could be any more obvious. My doctors have all of the diagnostic criteria sitting right there, and just won't call it?? And instead just keep wanting to draw my blood to test my thyroid. It's like the fourth time they're testing my thyroid.

My therapist recommends a functional medicine doctor, but i did the research and it looks like they're totally out of pocket, which I can't afford because I've been out on leave from work most of the year due to my health issues and am likely going to lose my job. This situation is costing me my income, my relationship, my sanity. Hell, I've lost almost 40lbs since this all started because I'm either not eating enough due to the pain or just dumping everything 20 minutes after every meal. I've already cut out caffeine, coffee, dairy, and high-histamine foods. I have Celiac on top of it so it's just like, a lot.

I've improved immensily on the H1+H2 antihistamine, but my issue is that I still can't go into the office without a severe setback. Pretty sure the florescent lighting & stress is triggering reactions, but ofc I don't have a formal diagnosis for ANY of my symptoms so it's all my guesswork.

So yeah, what the hell am I supposed to do? I'm already 14 weeks into an IOP to treat the ptsd and ideations from these experiences. I just want my life back.",5,1763928992.0,MCAS,9,1.0,False

I saw UBC posts guidelines that above a certain value it's subject to review (like 500$) but would something smaller like a coffee shop giftcard of like 25-50 be reportable or seen as bribery? 

My family is really pushing me to give gifts and I'm scared to because I really don't want it to be seen like I have malicious intentions. Is it normal to give gifts to professors?
