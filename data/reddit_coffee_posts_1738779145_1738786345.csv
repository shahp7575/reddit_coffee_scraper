I've come to the point where I really am enjoying very light, to ultra light coffees.

I'm looking for roasters within Europe that also ship internationally, which do those kinds of coffees. 

I realize that there are a lot of Nordic roasters like Tim Wendelboe, April, Coffea Circulor, etc. However what I've noticed is that they tend to roast rather inconsistently. 

They market themselves as Nordic roast, implying they roast mostly light, but depending on the bean they might go to medium roast, if they find that tends to bring out the best out of the bean. I have absolutely no problem with that! It's just that it has kind of become a gamble on roast level, especially since 99% of the roasters online don't actually state how light they roast the specific bean you're buying. 

I know of The Picky Chemist who exlusively does (ultra) light, as well as Onyx.EU roasting very light. I'm just having a hard time justifying the price of their coffees. Most of Onyx.EU coffees are listed for over 50 bucks for 10oz, with some going as high as 100 or 140. It seems you're mostly buying into prestige/brand. 


Bonus points if they also do some experimental processing, however that is not strictly necessary. I enjoy a good washed coffee too.


So I've come here to ask some advice on where you guys buy your (ultra) light roasts. Cheers!",0,1738786194.0,pourover,0,0.5,False

I was a dairy fiend 4 weeks ago. Large cups of milk, whole milk lattes, bowls of cereal, ice creams, yogurts - you name it, I had it in my fridge on standby. Any time of the day, I had my dairy fixes. I really enjoyed my dairy based meals/drinks and never had any digestive issues with it. Not even in the slightest.

My babies are toddlers now and it felt like the right time to start counting calories and shed some weight to get back to my pre-pregnancy body. I started off easy and bought low-fat yogurts with protein and cut out milk for the most part (maybe a little in coffees/teas, and my lattes) and some snacking cheeses. I felt fine for the first 1-2 weeks until I didn’t restock the dairy products and made shifts to other types of low calorie foods for a period of time. I restocked on my typical dairy products this week, had my morning latte as a treat/cheat and I’ve never been so bloated and uncomfortable after a meal. My stomach is in knots and I’ve got tons of nausea. 

I had a huge epiphany while I writhe in pain on my bathroom floor - I felt this way to a degree a day or two back after a protein packed parfait. I also felt this way after a vegi shake I made with Greek yogurt but it was a tad worse. Today is over the top and bad. 

I think I’ve developed lactose intolerance by cutting out dairy significantly in a short timeframe. Introducing it back in bursts is a reckoning for me and I’m in denial. Any advice is welcome but I’m more so just grieving a bit because I absolutely love whole milk.",1,1738786151.0,loseit,0,0.99,False

https://www.reddit.com/r/metaNL/s/UMz4HOXMfB

After reading the subs rules, I saw that some times the mods need 48 hours to discuss before giving a response. It’s been over 48 hours so I am following up.

Can you please provide an explanation of how Rule 11 (Toxic Nationalism) is applied? I’ve noticed in recent weeks an uptick in deleted comments for Rule 11 (Toxic Nationalism), including a few of my own. While that’s not necessarily concerning given recent events, I’ve noticed that this appears to apply very broadly to comments about non-US countries, it appears to be completely disregarded when it comes to comments mocking and condemning US citizens.

For reference, here is Rule 11:

> Rule XI: Toxic Nationalism/Regionalism

>Refrain from condemning countries and regions or their inhabitants at-large in response to political developments, mocking people for their nationality or region, or advocating for colonialism or imperialism.

For example, here are the two comments of mine that were recently deleted:

https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/s/4ilgAzedu4

> I’m not a fan of how the US went about this (threatening Panama), but it seems like the right outcome was reached.

>China really shouldn’t have influence over the Panama Canal, considering its strategic importance to the Americas. I’m not holding my breath, but hopefully Mullino is right to be over in the US and this ultimately leads to strengthening ties and more US investment in Panamanian infrastructure.

https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/s/jNwKfYjJnj

> I’m sure the Colombian people are going to be thrilled with facing higher prices and a US Visa freeze because Petro decided to deny access to Colombian citizens.

Now, while I don’t view these as Toxic Nationalism given the language of the rule as I am not mocking or condemning people, I concede that these views are a bit outside the typical thinking here, so I’m fine if the mods think that they should be removed. My main issue, however, is the fact that there are *numerous” examples of comments mocking and condemning Americans in a much worse manner, which are left in place.

Here are a few examples:

This recent chain discusses people hoping that the UAW workers get fired due to fallback from Trump’s policies:

https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/s/Mn45WSoyVM

This thread, in the same post as my deleted comment re:Colombia, mocks Americans for likely facing higher coffee prices due to the tariffs:

https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/s/K4xYGdsLT5

This commenter said that they hope that Trump’s policies hurt the people that voted for him. The rest of the thread follows suit:

https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/s/YW8k4wAz0c

It’s gotten to the point where it seems like every thread you can find examples of people mocking Americans and hoping they get their comeuppance for electing Trump. 

What exactly is the difference between my comment and the others, besides the fact that mine isn’t aimed at the US or Americans? 

Why aren’t we allowed to comment something like “[Citizens of Country X] won’t be happy with [impact of decision made by leader of Country X]” but comments that say “I hope this hurts” or “I want them to be absolutely fucking miserable” when it comes to the impacts of American policies on Americans is completely fine?",1,1738786049.0,metaNL,12,1.0,False

My fiancé and I are going to be spending nearly a whole month working and vacationing in Inverness from mid-May to mid-June, and we are incredibly excited to be spending an extended period of time in your city! We're an early 30s couple from the US (sorry), and both love good food, the outdoors, history, board games, and (of course) a solid dram.  
  
We really want to make the most of our visit, and in particular would love to take advantage of our breadth of time here to also do some things that are decidedly less ""tourist-y"", in particular some recurring activities we might be able to join in from week to week. And, while my fiancé will be working most days Mon-Fri, I'm going to have full availability during our time here to explore, and want to try some less conventional trips (overnight bike rides to distilleries, wild camping, etc).  
  
That all said, we had some questions we were hoping we might get answered based on local knowledge:

* Are there any shops running weekly events such as board game nights, art classes, or pub trivia?
* Related, are there any resources we could use for finding out about small events run by local businesses (such as cooking classes, open mic night, etc)? We both love cooking, especially my fiancé, and would be very excited if there was any sort of cooking/baking/cocktail class happening while we were here.
* We'll only be doing a car hire for a couple weekend trips, and so I'll largely be using a bike or public transit to explore during the weeks. Are there any great places to visit that might be 1-2 days by bike, or could be done in a single day by bus? I've looked at biking the Great Glen Way (and possibly hiking Ben Nevis from there), but am curious about other, maybe slightly less ambitious routes that capture some of the region's beauty. And for buses, is there a good app to use to map out potential routes?
* Beyond some of the big name distilleries, are there any local whisky or gin distillers that might be good to explore that don't get enough recognition? I'm mostly a fan of peat and sherry in my whisky, but up for anything that comes highly recommended.
*  For my fiancé, she'll be working some in the apartment we've rented, but wants to work some in coffee shops and cafes in the city center. She'll be working an adjusted schedule so will working mostly during the late morning and afternoon; are there any shops in town she should make sure to visit early on?

1iij95i,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/1iij95i/inspired_by_the_fear_of_being_average_story/,Inspired by the fear of being average [STORY],"Yesterday, while having coffee with a friend, we ended up talking about dreams. “What do you really want to do?” he asked me. It’s a question I’ve faced countless times, with different people, at different moments. But the answer, inevitably, always comes down to the same thing:

“Yeah, but it’s just a dream. It’s not for us. Some people are meant for that, and then there’s us… just regular people.”

This sentence has stuck with me my whole life.

As a kid, I loved playing football. And like every child, I dreamed big. I imagined myself in a huge stadium, the crowd cheering, my friends and family in the stands rooting for me. I dreamed of being the best, of hearing people say, “Wow, you’re incredible!”

But the reality was that the voices around me kept repeating the same thing:

“Impossible. The people you see on TV were born that way, with special talent. You… you’re just an average kid.”

Even now, it still stings just to write it. Maybe I wasn’t as good as I thought, maybe I never would have become a champion. But that’s not the point. Hearing those words over and over made me give up before I even had a real chance to try.

Years have passed, but the feeling is still the same.

Every time I talk about my dreams, the response I get is always some version of the same idea:

“Why don’t you just get a normal job? Go out on weekends, have drinks with friends, take a summer trip to the nearest beach, and every now and then, buy yourself some new gadget so you can finally stop writing all that weird code on your PC. That’s it.”

*NO. Absolutely not.*

Wait, hold on. I know what you might be thinking. “And what’s wrong with that?” Or maybe, “Who are you, some rich kid who can afford to dream big?”

Sorry to disappoint you, but no. There’s no big bank account waiting for me. And no, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that kind of life. In fact, many of the people I know live exactly like that, and they’re probably happy.

But not me.

I want more. I want to push beyond the average. To do more, to achieve more. And yes, I get it, taking risks, pushing boundaries, trying to go beyond what’s safe can be a crazy thing to do.

And yet, for the first time, I’m actually testing this belief. For months, I’ve been working on something of my own, a project that at first seemed like just another idea, one of those that usually gets left in a drawer. But not this time. This time, I stuck with it, despite the doubts, despite the fear of failing. And this Sunday… this Sunday, it’s finally happening. I’m launching it publicly.

You only live once, and time moves faster than it seems.

I used to work from home, and while I was doing my work I could skitter around the house and do laundry, pet the cats, eat a snack, what have you. If I was tired of being at home, I could go to a coffee shop and work from there. It eventually ended up being a little overwhelming because I started to feel like I should somehow be accomplishing a full time job and cleaning everything/taking care of the home simultaneously instead of having work-life boundaries. So I thought an in-person job would help. 

My new job is an office job as a staff attorney about 40 minutes away from home. And boy, am I bored. Don’t get me wrong, there are some periods of stress and overwhelm. But the vast majority of the time that I am here, I am absolutely losing my mind from boredom. I’ve bought a word search pad and fun fancy highlighters to hide in my desk, I’ve attempted to make reading fun again by stashing a book, I’ve scrolled Reddit and Facebook ad infinitum. I’ve made list after list on my phone. Lists of lists. I’ve deep-dived into how I’m going to do my taxes this year. I’ve considered taking up postcrossing again and stashing postcards somewhere to write. I’ve made a list of every postcard writing prompt I could think up for when I decide to do that. I do the daily Wordle and Strands and Connections and Contexto. But I just can’t stand how understimulated I am at work. And it’s not feasible to leave this job one month after having it. I’m giving it at least one year’s fighting chance. 

Are there any meaningful or entertaining things I haven’t thought of that I can do during my work day? Nothing that requires a computer, but it can require a phone. Anything that I can easily clean up and stash away. Does anyone have any suggestions? Or coping mechanisms for when I want to bash my head into the desk? 

TL;DR - My job is SO slow most of the time, and I’m looking for easy, no-mess, unproblematic things I can do at my desk when I have no work left and/or ways to cope with the boredom so I don’t poke my eyes out. ",2,1738785404.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

Of course I complained to the company, and got back a bot reply that I would have to return them at my expense for a refund. I have not done so because several of the complaints listed at the Better Business Bureau said they had done so and were ghosted.

I should note that they arrived a month after ordering, including tracking, which showed them shipped from China.

The exam did not go as planned in my opinion, I showed up 20 minutes early and she said your appointment is tomorrow (I asked her to double check).  I do not think she prepared for the exam.  She only had a blank piece of paper she was taking notes on.


I want to put a couple things out here incase any of you do this C&P exam.

1.  I expected her to ask how it effects my daily activities (didn't). 
2.  She asked how do I feel this is service connected.  I said when my anxiety is up so is the leg syndrome (she asked are you service connected for anxiety...)
3.  She asked about my CPAP usage.  I said I use it religiously and have very few incidents (less than 2 per hour I offered to show her the app on my phone).
4.  She specifically asked if I had leg syndrome while using CPAP.  I said yes, I also mentioned that my leg was shaking right there during the conversation.
5.  We discussed my wife's issue with it and her getting bruised up with my violent kicks (we now keep pillows between us).
6.  We discussed my weight loss, reduction in alcohol, and reduction in coffee.  Even though I am not considered obese I still snore like a freight train without the CPAP (usually when I nap on the couch I won't use the machine).

I have had about 6 prior C&P exams.  The ones that I thought sucked got the highest ratings, the ones I thought went well were not service connected.  I have no idea how this one is going to go.

Perhaps you all can help clarify. I got instructions in the form of a voice mail from a nurse. I realize I could have called back to ask for more details, but I didn't actually pay attention to some of the details until last night, and the prep was supposed to be today for the procedure at 10 am tomorrow. I do not have any special GI issues, just getting this done since the last one was at 55 yrs. Between my wife and I, we've had several of these, and every time it seems the prep solution is a different product with a different procedure. The prep I got is a gallon, its label says 1 glass per hour till it's gone. The clinic said half the night before and half between 5 and 7 am prior to the 10 am procedure. 

1. Instructions said ""clear liquid diet the day before."" Does this mean no breakfast even prior to 10 am the day before? Or should it be 24 hours, meaning I can have solid food for breakfast the day before? I get pretty hungry and cranky and if I have to miss the entire day of meals, I'd have to be off work the day before as well. I did not plan for that.
2. Instructions defined clear liquids as soda, coffee, tea with no cream. I seem to remember last time I drank bullion and Jello (avoiding red and purple flavors). Are those OK, or do they now expect a person to go the entire day (possibly on no breakfast as above) surviving on only sugar and caffeine?
3. This one is kind of academic, but I'm curious. I have A1C in the range where I am technically considered diabetic but not high enough to treat with insulin (between 6 and 7). I take Metformin and it's well controlled. I don't check my glucose at home. The instructions said to check my glucose, which I'm sure was automatic because of the diabetes diagnosis. So no big deal. What I'm wondering is that if I was, how could a serious diabetic be expected to manage their blood sugar for 24 hrs with only soda pop?

1iij12r,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1iij12r/age_gap_work_crush_25m_35m/,Age gap / work crush (25M) (35M),"So I (25M) have a pretty debilitating crush on my former boss (35M). Novel incoming because I am horrible at limiting my stream of conciousness.



Without revealing too much, I worked for him a few years back in a summer job, then again this past winter for an ever shorter-term gig at the same company. I have no guarantee of working for him again, as it's sort of a revolving door thing, but it's definitely not impossible as I think I left a good impression on the whole team. I had developed a crush on him the first time, but was able to resist it under the assumption that I'd probably never see him again; I wasn't anticipating being invited back for any future work. It took me a while to forget about him. Sure enough when he called for this most recent season, all those feelings came rushing back, and got far worse once we were actually reunited. I'll be talking primarily about that summer, since that's still the majority of the time I've spent in person with him.



I think he's shown some signs of interest in me, though I can't tell if I'm projecting and he's just trying to be a good mentor. When we first met, he and I would sometimes stay after meetings and just chat for pretty much however long we could; sometimes it'd only be a few minutes, but when we could we'd go on forever. He was constantly asking about the things I'm interested in. He wanted to know what I wanted to do after college and he'd give me life advice. There were also times where all we talked about was our hobbies, our favorite books and movies, etc, and we would genuinely talk for hours. He said I remind him of himself, and how it was like looking in a mirror talking to me. I honestly feel the same way, because so many of our paths have been so similar. Our interests are so aligned, and he's a lot of the things I want to be both personally and professionally. We think the same thoughts, make the same jokes, and want a lot of the same things in life. I rarely have this much in common with a person. It really felt like he was the first person who got every part of me.



As the summer went on, I felt that our relationship was different than with the rest of our team. He'd be constantly giving me special attention and accommodations. He'd put me on assignments that were just me and him, and tell me that he was glad to have someone he could trust and who thought the same as him. We both went out of our ways to do a lot for each other. He told me that whenever I was stressed about something, work or otherwise, that I could talk to him about anything at any time. Even if it was 3am and I was sad about something he had nothing to do with, he wanted to know about it. From there we had a lot more conversations about our personal lives, and he opened up to me about not being satisfied with where he is on his own path. It seemed so crazy to me because I think he is incredibly smart, handsome, charismatic, and successful already, but I really appreciated that he was willing to be open with me about things himself, and it made me feel closer to him. Like I had been doing already, he started telling me about opportunities he was applying for and the things he wanted to accomplish once the season was over. He'd talk about how something someone on his level in the organization was doing was annoying him, or how he and his sister were talking about something earlier in the day. I felt like our relationship had started to move beyond more than that of just boss and employee; maybe to friends, but more than boss / employee.



I think there was also some flirtiness to our banter, though I have to say it's hard to judge this because I feel this is probably where I'm imagining things the most... creatively. He would make a lot of gay jokes that where the only subjects were ever him and myself; nothing too crazy, but stuff like not needing to get two drinks because we could just share one, or how I could just cuddle up with him if it was cold outside. He'd always have a pretty flirty smirk when he'd make these jokes, and I honestly couldn't look him in the eyes because I'd get too flushed. In private he'd be a little more direct and comment on how my hair looked good or how he liked a certain color on me. I once made a similar comment about a hat he wore and then I noticed he wore it a bunch more for the rest of the summer. He asked to buy me food/a drink every once in a while at work functions, and on my one day off he actually even asked if I would want to go get coffee since he was off as well, but I unfortunately had plans that required me to go home for the day. (The job was in a town that neither of us lived close to) He's way quicker and wittier than I am, so sometimes I would only register something he said as possibly being a little flirty like half an hour later.



I feel like our relationship really just kept improving and improving until the very end. On the last day, he asked me not to leave before we could meet up (afaik he did not do this for anyone else) and he gave me the biggest bear hug and lingered for a really long time. He thanked me for how amazing of a summer we had, and said that we would talk again soon. I thanked him for everything as well. At this point I had already resolved myself to not act on my crush because I was so afraid of the ""shit where you eat"" philosophy, but if there was any point where I was closest to breaking, this was probably it. We kept somewhat frequent contact for a few months after I returned to my last year of grad school, but it was admittedly mostly initiated by me, and it eventually stopped pretty much entirely. That was until I got a call from him out of the blue asking me to come back this year.



This year's experience was MUCH shorter, though not any less confusing. When I first returned I got the same big bear hug, and immediately a comment about how he likes my new hair (It was quite long when I worked for him previously but it's shorter now). He even mentioned that that was one of the first things he was wondering about when we were going to reunite, about whether or not I'd have changed anything about my style. We caught up on what things have changed for both of us professionally since last time, as it has been quite a while. He remembers a lot of the small details about things we talked about back in the day. Quickly he and I went right back to our original cadence of banter / talking about everything and nothing at the same time. I'd say the most flirty thing that happened this time was him doting over me really hard when I had an allergic reaction to something in the food we were eating. One time in the context of a larger conversation I said ""I kind of have a hard time saying no to people"" and he said ""that's good to know"" and smirked at me. Another time he had like 10 different seats available to him on a bus we were all taking somewhere and he walked past literally all of them to sit next to me at the back of the bus, where we talked about what I was gonna do when I got home and how I should consider coming and working for him during the year. A lot of times our arms and/or legs would practically be touching at a table and he would make no effort to distance himself. By the end of our short time together, I had gone from almost completely over him to more obsessed than I ever was the first time. It's been a few weeks, but I still have a hard time not thinking about him. It's definitely not going away nearly as easily this time. We live in the same city now, and I want to get to know him without the restraints of work soooooooo badly.



I asked him to get coffee, and he said yes. But as much as I am swooning and am imagining it like a date, the logical part of me knows that there's a huge chance he's just thinking of this as a hangout or, worse, me just wanting to ask for career advice. I didn't expressly call it a date. I don't really know how to go about making my intentions clear without risking what I already have with him, and possibly losing the opportunity to work with him or the associated organization in the future.



I'm going on and on about things that I've perceived as signs, but I'm worried that I'm reading into things that are more or less innocuous and I'm just WANTING them to be super flirty. I am only recently out of the closet and have not really pursued crushes before. I have not been blind to the fact that there is definitely a strong layer of mentorship going on and there's also an age gap. It's not a dealbreaker for me, but it could be for him. He may just not see me that way. He also doesn't ever really text me first, when we're off-season, but I've been chalking that up to our regular lives both being quite different and quite busy. 



For the record, I know for sure that he is not in a relationship, but I don't know 100% for sure if he is gay; he's just never expressed interest in women, and almost all of the sexual references I've heard him make have been gay.



Do I pursue him for real? Can I even make any hints that would save me the shame of rejection? I think I could accept him not wanting a romantic relationship, but I would be pretty disappointed if he doesn't at least want to be more active of friends than we are now, and would be devastated if this turned him off and made me lose him entirely. I'd also lose the job which would suck too, but I'd be way more upset about losing him.",1,1738785084.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

As the first light of dawn filtered through the curtains, Sarah reached for her favorite mug, the one adorned with tiny coffee beans dancing around its rim.

Java Burn is a dissolvable, tasteless packet designed to be mixed into coffee, aiming to boost metabolism and energy levels. Intrigued by its claims, Sarah had spent hours reading reviews and researching its ingredients. The promise of enhanced energy and reduced cravings was too enticing to ignore.  
She tore open the sleek packaging and emptied the contents into her steaming coffee. Stirring it in, she noted that it didn't alter the aroma or taste of her beloved brew. Taking her first sip, she felt a sense of anticipation.  
The initial days were subtle. Sarah noticed a gentle increase in her energy levels, a slight reduction in her mid-morning hunger pangs. Encouraged, she continued her routine, incorporating Java Burn into her daily coffee.  
By the end of the second week, the changes were more pronounced. Her usual afternoon slump was less debilitating, and she found herself more focused during work meetings. The scale showed a modest weight loss, but more importantly, she felt a renewed sense of vitality.  
Curious about others' experiences, Sarah delved into online forums. One user shared, ""I've been feeling more energized, noticed a bit of a reduction in those mid-morning cravings, and I swear my metabolism's doing a happy dance.""  
These shared experiences resonated with her own journey.  
However, not all feedback was glowing. Some users expressed skepticism, citing minimal changes or questioning the product's efficacy. Sarah understood that individual results could vary based on factors like diet, exercise, and personal metabolism.  
Determined to maximize the benefits, she paired her Java Burn routine with mindful eating and regular walks. Over the next month, she shed a few more pounds and felt more in tune with her body's needs.  
Reflecting on her journey, Sarah acknowledged that while Java Burn wasn't a magic solution, it served as a valuable tool in her wellness arsenal. It complemented her efforts, providing that extra boost she needed to stay committed to her health goals.  
In the end, Sarah's experience with Java Burn was a testament to the power of combining innovative supplements with healthy lifestyle choices. As she sipped her morning coffee, now a symbol of her transformation, she felt a profound sense of accomplishment and optimism for the future.  
For those considering Java Burn, it's essential to approach it with realistic expectations and a commitment to overall well-being. As with any supplement, individual experiences may vary, and it's always wise to consult with a healthcare professional before making significant changes to one's routine.  
Sarah's journey was just one of many, but it highlighted the potential benefits of Java Burn when used thoughtfully and in conjunction with a balanced lifestyle.",1,1738784771.0,KibbexKpop,3,1.0,False

What is Java Burn?  
Java Burn is a powdered supplement designed to be mixed into your coffee. Unlike traditional weight loss pills or shakes, Java Burn is unique because it dissolves seamlessly in your morning coffee without adding any taste. According to the manufacturers, Java Burn is formulated to enhance the fat-burning process by boosting your metabolism and improving your body’s ability to burn calories more efficiently. The supplement contains natural ingredients known to help in weight loss, all without any harmful stimulants or additives.

 

Ingredients of Java Burn  
One of the key factors that people consider before using any supplement is its ingredients. What are the ingredients in Java Burn that make it effective? The product is made up of several natural compounds that are known to aid weight loss:

Green Tea Extract: Known for its antioxidant properties, green tea extract can boost metabolism and increase fat burning.  
Chlorogenic Acid: This compound, found in coffee, reduces the absorption of carbohydrates in the digestive system, helping to prevent fat buildup.  
L-Theanine: An amino acid that works to improve focus and reduce anxiety, making it an excellent complement to the caffeine in coffee.  
Chromium: This mineral regulates blood sugar levels, helping to curb appetite and reduce cravings.

These ingredients work synergistically to deliver the promised benefits of increased fat burning and improved metabolism. Users have reported significant results, praising the supplement for helping them lose weight without the jitters or crashes often associated with caffeine-heavy products.

We met about 2 1/2 years ago, we’ve been living together for about 4 months. Long story short, over the time we spent together he had a lot of really hard luck and despite my best efforts to support him he fell heavily into drinking to cope. 

Things came to a head in January when he lost his job, his car, got a dui, and found himself in at least 3 fights. A couple weeks ago he went on another bender and came home ridiculously drunk. I was annoyed and went downstairs to get a snack and zone out on some tv to get some distance from him. I saw he left his phone out and alarm bells went off in my head. I looked and saw that he’s been on Grindr since September. 

By the time I scrolled through everything I heard him calling for help. I took my time to get upstairs and when I found him, he fell out of bed and couldn’t get back up, I told him that it was the last time I was going to help him. I saw his Grindr and that he needed to get out of my house. I then sat down and texted his mom and sister, explaining everything complete with screenshots, and told them they needed to come get him.

His sister came within a couple of hours and checked him into a hotel. He’s since been to rehab to detox and is apparently out now because they don’t have the room for him. 

I blocked him immediately but his mom and sister have been incredibly supportive. His sister has been checking in, even though she has been crazy sick, and I have a coffee date with his mom on Saturday to bring some of his stuff. I’ve been cleaning all week to try and gather everything together. Most of his things are boxed/bagged up in my living room. I just don’t have the heart to make his mom pay for storage, so I guess it’ll just sit there until he can get his act together and take care of it himself. 

I don’t know how I keep finding myself in these awful situations. Cheated on in two marriages and now this. Is there a neon sign coming from my head that I can’t see? “Please cheat” Seriously. I think I’m just doomed to only choose between being lonely or treated like crap, and I don’t get why. I know I’m not perfect, but I’m committed and loyal to the people I love and care for.

I have a hard time with basic things a lot of the time; not getting into a spiel about what's wrong with me but physically and mentally it is hard to just live life. I feel whenever I attempt to be more functional she starts trying to undermine me... I recently stopped receiving SNAP because now you are required to work/train/volunteer 80 hrs/m; I was talking about taking a job delivering papers because it is one of the few jobs I could actually do - ""That's too dangerous. You will hate it. Why don't you work in an office? You could do accounting - I did that. You don't want to deliver papers"". I waited and now the job is gone. Shortly after this I said something along the lines of ""God, I am craving pizza"" and was met with ""well you can't have any pizza you're fucking indigent, what, do you think that your mommy should pay for your take out?"" (I didn't ask her for pizza).

 I never developed healthy hygiene as a child - I recently started trying to keep track of brushing my teeth daily. I need my own toothpaste and a clean toothbrush. She takes extreme offense to me not sharing a tube of toothpaste with her, my toothbrush ends up on the floor unless I put it in a drawer or cabinet. She ignores me for hours or days if I bring up her taking my tube. I cannot mentally force myself to use the same tube as her because she leaves it totally encrusted with dry paste and uses her saliva covered tooth brush to scrape some off when she brushes her teeth. She tells me that I am criticizing her by wanting my own tube, that I am rigid and she can't believe I turned out this way. 

I try to do what I can around the house but she bombards me with several different requests first thing in the morning and all day continues asking. For example, if I needed to do laundry, do dishes, take out garbage, get groceries, sweep/mop and cook dinner she will come up with other things she needs me to do *for her*. I will be doing both of our laundry and she suddenly doesn't know how to turn her phone on. After I turn her phone on she wants me to make her a pot of coffee. Then make her a cup. Then crawl under her bed because she thinks she dropped something down there. Then I will try to go back to what I was doing but she will ask me why I am not doing something else instead, isn't something else more urgent? Somehow I am doing laundry wrong as well, or I should have done it already, or she wanted to wash something and I should have asked before I started.... 

Reading this back I know it sounds like I am just whining but this petty, needless struggle goes on everyday and and I am so, so tired. I can no longer tell what is malicious but sometimes it feels like she secretly enjoys being able to trip me up when I am just trying to get by. ",1,1738784205.0,raisedbynarcissists,3,1.0,False

Btw I’m a mortgage free homeowner and I can afford weekly $150 omakase for two, but that’s not the point.

He suggested that asking the girl to wear a dress is normal since the guy is buying, and that I’m nuts for overreacting.

With its rich history, stunning architecture, world-class art, and vibrant culture, it's easy to see why Paris is considered one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Whether you're visiting for a long vacation or a weekend getaway, this essential guide will help you make the most of your time in the City of Light.

# 1. Getting Around Paris

Navigating Paris is relatively simple, thanks to its well-connected public transportation system. The Paris Métro (subway) is the most convenient and affordable way to travel around the city. With stations located throughout the city, you can easily hop on and off to explore different neighborhoods and attractions. For a more scenic journey, consider taking the famous Paris buses or even a boat ride along the River Seine.

Walking is another fantastic way to explore Paris, as many of the city's major attractions are within walking distance from each other. Plus, wandering through the charming streets and hidden passages gives you a more intimate experience of the city.

# 2. Top Attractions You Can’t Miss

No trip to Paris would be complete without visiting some of its iconic attractions. The **Eiffel Tower** is undoubtedly the city's most famous landmark, offering breathtaking views of the city from its observation decks. Whether you take the elevator or climb the stairs to the top, the view is worth every step.

Another must-see is the **Louvre Museum**, home to thousands of masterpieces, including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. For art lovers, the Louvre is an unmissable cultural treasure. The **Notre-Dame Cathedral** also deserves a visit, not only for its awe-inspiring Gothic architecture but also for its history as a symbol of Paris itself.

If you enjoy history and culture, head to **Montmartre**, a neighborhood known for its bohemian vibe and artistic heritage. The **Sacré-Cœur Basilica** offers panoramic views of Paris, and the surrounding streets are full of charming cafés and galleries.

# 3. Indulge in Parisian Cuisine

Paris is renowned for its world-class food, and no visit is complete without sampling the city's culinary delights. Start your day with a fresh croissant or pain au chocolat from a local bakery, and pair it with a café au lait. For lunch, indulge in a savory French baguette sandwich or a classic quiche.

In the evening, you’ll find an array of options, from casual bistros to gourmet restaurants. Don’t miss out on trying iconic French dishes such as **coq au vin** (chicken in wine sauce), **escargot** (snails), and **ratatouille** (a vegetable stew). Finish your meal with a delicious dessert like **crème brûlée** or a perfectly delicate macaron.

# 4. Discover Paris’s Hidden Gems

While the major landmarks are essential, don’t overlook the charming hidden gems that make Paris so unique. Visit **Le Marais**, one of Paris’s oldest districts, with its cobblestone streets, boutique shops, and quaint cafés. The **Canal Saint-Martin** area is another lovely spot for a peaceful walk or a relaxing café stop.

For something a little off the beaten path, head to the **Musée de l’Orangerie**, a lesser-known art museum showcasing Monet’s stunning Water Lilies series. Or, stroll through the **Luxembourg Gardens**, a tranquil oasis perfect for a leisurely afternoon.

# 5. Embrace the Parisian Pace

One of the most delightful aspects of Paris is the laid-back, relaxed pace of life. Embrace the slow rhythm of the city by taking time to sit at a café, people-watch, and enjoy the moment. Parisians love their coffee breaks, and you’ll find that the café culture is an integral part of the city’s charm. Don’t rush through your day; instead, enjoy the small moments, whether it’s a leisurely breakfast, a stroll through a park, or an evening walk along the Seine.

But what you can't say is it was a studios policy to hire people based on skin color. He literal said he would give ""portfolio and job ADVICE"" for black devs trying to get into the industry. Nothing about hiring practices. 

Why do I care? Because I like Obsidian games and I want them to succeed. A successful game means a bigger budget and that means bigger games. I just dont get why the hell is this former dev trying to ruin a studio? Going as far as lying and tagging the richest man in the world in an attempt to do it. Just ranting but yeah, this is bullshit.

1iiik7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/wegmans/comments/1iiik7b/resignation/,Resignation,I don't know who sees these or if anyone will care. I doubt it very much. I would like some feedback.  I recently resigned from my position at Wegmans. I worked there for seven years. Good worker no problems on time excelled in my positions. In seven years went from 8.75 he to 18.75 hr. Worked coffee bar til it closed while also cross training and working prepared foods while they still had hot cold bars and chefs case where you could get six dollar meals custom. Back when everything was still made and cooked in store. Anyway last year in Feb I was accused of swearing at a co worker. It was a completely false accusation. I was treated like a criminal in asst store managers office with my chef present. No HR person was present or referred to. I was threatened with dismissal pending further investigation. Weeks went by .I was afraid for my job the entire time. Then in May I got a skin infection in my right leg.in hospital and out on disability. It took forever to heal. And just healed after Christmas. So I had a decision to Make .go back to the toxic work environment where I was never given an outcome for those accusations and no HR person ever since talked to me about it. And I had a great deal of contact with them thru my disability. So I decided to just resign. This is just the straw that broke the camels back. When the current store manager came u tried to address an ongoing situation in coffee and his words we...I'm not willing to address situations that occurred before I came to the store. Just like that dismissed and unheard and HR would not pursue anything because tth store manager said no. Then I had the most current chef telling everyone I had a bad attitude because I questioned certain procedures that I knew were being done incorrectly. So every time I would try to address it he said you have a bad attitude. I need you to work with me here.  So I finally just stopped saying anything and went in and did my job and what he asked me to do. I felt deflated and defeated. Anyone have anything to say? I won't divulge the store or managers here.

Hello! My name is Daniel, and I’m a video editor based in Philadelphia, PA, USA. I’ve been writing postcards to people from my various travels for a couple years now, including to penpals I’ve made in this forum! I’d especially love someone who is interested in exchanging postcards (honestly, I love sending more than I even care about receiving them).

A little about me, 

* Like I said, video editor (kinda cool for a boring desk job). I mostly work in documentary, which is nice because I get to work with a lot of different formats and stuff.
* I’m a fan of conversational writing, if not evidenced by this post. I tend to write letters similarly.
* I am a huge dork for history. Something about the past feeling alive, especially in places I can visit, is so fun for me. Any postcard with an obscure historical site, or a cute drawing of something old, is a favorite.
* I enjoy sitting in coffee shops to write. This is not unique, I know, but all the same!
* I love Baseball. Another “the fact that it’s really old interests me” kind of thing. I also love the communal feeling of rooting for the same team.
* I take a lot of film photography, but that’s no promise that I’m good at it. I just like the feeling of doing everything manually sometimes, and photography gives me a way to do that without having to, like, work on cars or something similar where I’d need more space. If you want to send photos back and forth, I’d be into that!
* I am a huge nerd in general. Video games, genre films, anime. I love digging into any culture hole. I once spent a whole day reading about the history of flash games.
* I also sometimes like drawing little doodles on post-cards
* My music taste is pretty eclectic and unexplainable, but it ranges from indie rock to Japanese jazz. Speaking of-
* I am currently learning Japanese, and know a very tiny bit of Italian. If you write in either of these languages, I’d love to practice with you, if you don’t mind! Expect my performance to be lackluster.

Ok, that’s probably enough for now! If you’re interested, shoot me a DM and we’ll get to know each other, maybe exchange addresses to send some physical letters!",1,1738783480.0,penpals,0,1.0,False
1iiid87,https://www.reddit.com/r/30PlusSkinCare/comments/1iiid87/bbl_laser_experience_discussion/,BBL laser experience & discussion,"I did my first laser treatment yesterday - BBL. They left the numbing stuff on for 30 minutes and it definitely worked because I felt nothing at all lol. I obviously saw the flashing lights but that was the only part I noticed as it happened. The actual process took maybe 20-25 minutes at most. She put exosomes on my face after -- I left looking like a glazed donut, but no redness at all. 

They gave me a cute little aftercare kit & I used it last night and this morning so far. I made sure to put SPF on and will reapply if I go back out before sunset. 

I scheduled 2 more BBL treatments to do the recommended 3 to start off. I have a pretty pale/fair complexion with a bit of redness/ uneven tones, a broken capillary near my mouth, and I am trying to reduce fine lines and achieve a nicer texture overall. My hope was that I could take my ""pretty good"" skin and eventually turn it into near perfect skin lol. I follow a skincare routine AM and PM and I bought the omnilux LED mask during December --- going to start incorporating that nightly. 

So some questions for discussion:
1. Do you feel the BBL treatments is a good choice for skin that's already pretty good but aiming to be better? If not, why/what do you recommend?
2. How long does it take to see results after you get the treatment usually? I asked if I would experience the ""coffee grounds"" and my aestheticisn told me no, because my skin is a milky complexion and I didn't have much sun damage to begin with. 
3. What do you consider your game changer treatments / products to be?

She argued that even though she did give them to me, she doesn't want anyone else to have any. She claims they are exclusively for me, and not for me to let my sister try. I argued that she is my sister, and that we've shared stuff with each other since we were little.

I don’t mind driving a little bit in the DFW area if there’s specific things not in those areas that I should check out, but I was hoping that some of you lovely folks would have some recommendations for me.

I’m not saying that teens or folks in their early 20s didn’t occasionally go to the mall, the movies, out to the bars or clubs, to hang out at a coffee shop, or other places that cost money - but we didn’t have a ton of extra money back then either. So we mostly just went to other people’s houses and hung out. 

Half the time you didn’t even have a real plan for what you’d do - sometimes you didn’t even really “do” anything you’d just sit around talking. Or you’d do basic stuff like listen to music, watch whatever was on TV, look through the DVD collection and pick one. 

Maybe someone had a ping pong table in their basement so you’d get really into ping pong for a few months because that’s where you hung out and it was there. Sometimes you’d get into stupid hijinks, some of my fondest teenage memories are things like building an igloo in the yard so we could smoke weed in it, or just playing video games with the fellas and cracking jokes in between, or badly freestyle rapping, or seeing how many times in a row we could flip the water bottle and have it land. 

Usually these tended to be more gendered spots on weeknights than on weekends you’d have bigger gatherings where guys and girls mixed, or where smaller friend groups would all link up and it would turn into a house party. In high school, you’d tend to congregate at the house with the chill parents who would look the other way at drinking and smoking, as you got older you’d congregate at the central spot where your friend that liked having people over lived.

You don’t need free public spaces to socialize, you just need to invite some folks from school/work/hobbies to come over to your house",5,1738782943.0,unpopularopinion,24,0.61,False

I came on her waist and she had her panties and her leggings on and the cum wasn’t even close to the clothes. Just a little bit of cum was on my fingers and I didn’t think much of it. Then like 30 minutes after I rubbed her over her panties and her leggings for maximum 45 seconds and I think didn’t even get close to the actual hole. 
Then comes the next day, she isn’t on her period, then the next then the next. Before all this her skin was bad and she got all the pre period symptoms but after the peroid magically disappeared because we wanted to do things, the symptoms never came back. 
So she is 7 days late today. So when we did it was a day before her period was supposed to be.The first few days were ok because she said it’s normal if she didn’t really want it sometimes it doesn’t come but 7days is too much.

I woke up one day and everyone, absolutely everyone, was - or is, gone. The internet is up, cable is running, electricity and water is still working, yet there's no one around and I can't get into contact with anyone. No one answers when I call on the phone, and although I can see the messages I've uploaded to social media, I see nothing from anyone else, just old posts and comments from the day before this happened that don't change when I refresh.  It's like time has been frozen, and all the animals, humans, and even bugs have been taken out of Earth. 

My name is - Oh, who the hell cares? Who is gonna see this anyway? This is the only way to keep from going insane, uploading detailed accounts of whatever's happening to me even though I have no idea if anyone can see it. If they can see it, then the  responses are invisible to me, because I've tried sending SOS messages to family, friends, and even strangers. 

Nothing big or unexpected happened before that day a few months ago. I'm a regular girl, working part time in the city and sitting through college lectures when I'm not manning the counter of my local coffee shop. I live - or, lived - with my parents and sister who's still in high school, since I couldn't afford to make it on my own yet. I had just come back from a late night shift, working overtime from open to close since someone called out at the last minute, and I took an Uber back home. I used my spare key to get in the house, ate leftovers from dinner, took a hot shower, and climbed into bed. 

I had no dreams or weird visions or anything. I woke up to the sunlight coming through my window blinds. I looked at the time on my phone and realized I had overslept. When I went downstairs, I heard nothing but the TV playing an early morning show my mom loved to watch after dropping my sister off at school. Dad's absence could be explained by him going to work, but my mom's was weird. I looked around for her but when I didn't find her, I didn't freak out. Not until I went outside, but I didn't do that until an hour had passed of me eating breakfast and thinking about the classes I’d missed the day before and that morning. 

I went out to catch a bus since it seemed Uber couldn't find a ride, and that's when I saw that my parents’ cars were still in the driveway. Maybe my sister went to school on the bus for once, that was plausible, but what wasn't was my dad going to work without his car and my mom running an errand without hers. I remember looking into the windows of their vehicles, seeing nothing amiss, and trying their cell phones. It rang and rang and ended with their voicemails. 

I don't think I realized how completely dead the neighborhood was until I walked to the nearest bus stop. Children's bikes were abandoned on the sidewalk, cars that would usually be gone during that time of day because the neighbors worked morning shifts like my dad were present in the garages. There was no sign of life anywhere, no birdsong, no butterflies or bees despite the weather conditions being perfect for them. Everything was so quiet, like an empty graveyard. I felt like something was deeply, deeply wrong, but I tried not to think about it as I waited for the bus.

The bus did not come after an hour, and traffic was strangely at a standstill. I began walking, travelling further into the city, and that's when I started to grow more concerned by the second. The city was just as dead as the neighborhood. The bus I had been waiting on was parked at a stop on a busy street, with no driver and no passengers. The wind blew grocery bags like they were tumbleweeds across the road, and the buildings, while all lit up from the inside, contained no people. No employees, no customers, you get the gist. At that point, I would've been overjoyed just to see a squirrel climb up a tree. 

I reacted just as anyone would. I panicked, and I mean panicked hard. I had an utter meltdown in the middle of broad street, hyperventilating and curling into a ball, soaked in my own sweat. There was no one around to help me, to call an ambulance or even ask if I was alright. It was maddening, and it wasn't even midday yet. I walked all the way to my job, found the cafe open but vacant, and then walked to my college campus, which of course yielded the same results. I sat down in the lecture hall, frantically googling anything on my phone that may relate to what was happening. All I could think was that the entire city had evacuated, and I was somehow left behind, or something like that… 

No news had been posted since yesterday on every website I checked. When I tried to refresh browser pages, the tabs would turn blank, and then an error message would appear. I went back home, which took at least three hours of walking, with sores developing on my feet, and got into my dad's car after finding his keys on the key tray in the hallway- a detail I hadn't noticed before. I was crying as I drove around the city, going around cars that were randomly stopped on the street. I drove past the city border, into the next town, which was exactly the same, so I drove to the next town after that one. During my impromptu road trip, I passed by unoccupied airports, the planes all there since clearly there were no flights taking off. 
 
The numbers I kept calling and texting were my family and friends’ and the police. I didn't know what else to do. Eventually I pulled over to the side of the road and sobbed and screamed in frustration, rocking in the driver's seat with my knees pulled up to my chest. I cried until I had no more tears left to shed, and my face was redder than a tomato with snot pouring out my nose like a faucet. This had to be a bad dream, I'd thought. Or some kind of super elaborate hoax of which I was the sole victim. 

Day in and day out, I focused on adapting until I came across someone, and keeping myself sane by watching old YouTube videos and saved Instagram reels. I didn't dare go back home, the lack of the sound of my sister's rude jokes at my expense, my dad's laughter at some stupid sitcom, and my mother's cooking only served to give me a deep depression during which I never left my room so I couldn't be reminded of how alone I was. Instead, I decided to try and make the most of this fucked up situation by travelling, since the world was still functioning, just without the people who made it that way. 

That's something I thought about a lot. As the weeks passed, I was so scared that the lights would shut off permanently and the water would stop running, so scared in fact, that it made me want to vomit and pass out. But that never happened, even reruns of TV shows still broadcasted when I turned on any TV. It was…really fucking weird. I mean, really really weird. Who was keeping the electrical paid, who was tending to the plumbing, who was broadcasting television and keeping WiFi servers up? The only catch was that I couldn't see anything new that was uploaded past the day I realized I was alone, meaning no recent news, no live shows, nothing. 

I tried not to think about this too hard, because to be honest, even though I was glad I could still flush toilets after I used them and turn on lights in dark rooms, the thought unsettled me. It made me feel like I was the center of the universe's cruelest practical joke, but I knew a prank of this magnitude was simply impossible. 

Unless… unless my brain was undergoing some high-tech simulator while my body was in the real world, making me think this was reality when it's actually a program designed as some mentally scarring experiment to see how a human would react when placed in this situation. At least, if that was the case, there was hope of me waking up and returning to normal society, but again, nothing happened the day before all this, I didn't consent to any experiment or scientific testing. And why would these hypothetical government agents or scientists choose me of all people? 

After the first two months, I began to…enjoy myself, a bit. Not too much, but a reasonable amount I’d like to think. I know it probably sounds crazy from your end, but if I kept making theories and freaking out about seemingly being the only person on the planet, or at least on the continent, then I would go insane. The hecticness of daily life is something we can all relate to, feeling like a cog in the machine and wondering if life is just one trial of survival after another. You might have thought to yourself, am I just gonna work nonstop until I die? Who am I? Why am I doing this? When can I just enjoy life and take it easy without worrying about the future, or bills? 

Well, when I realized that the upside to humanity being erased (hopefully temporarily) was no rules and responsibilities, I looked at things with a fresher perspective. I would keep travelling until I found someone like me of course (which was making me lose more hope each day, as I'd gone through a few states by this time), but I would at least take a moment to enjoy the peaceful solitude on the way. I've taken the best naps of my life in fields full of wildflowers, went skinny dipping in hot springs, and even went into a restaurant, thawed out the food from the walk-in fridge, and used their kitchen to cook myself gourmet meals to the best of my abilities. 

So many cars had keys in them, like they were all just sitting there for me to take a joyride in. I did donuts in parking lots, I went into Walmarts and stole video game consoles on which I played offline games on, and I slept in mansions and the best suites of any five star hotel. Every door was unlocked, making it unbelievably easy to go anywhere and do anything. One rich person's apartment I crashed in was in a high rise, and I had an amazing time swimming in a pool on their balcony, which you could see the city miles down below through the glass floor. 

I always had to have noise playing wherever I went. I kept one earphone in (in case I heard someone) and listened to music, and I always kept a TV on wherever I stayed. It replaced live human voices for me, it became white noise. I turned my tragedy into serenity, and though I still craved company, at least I could have a decent time until I found help, or woke up, or a scientist pulled the chords connecting my brain to the simulator or something.

That feeling of freedom and carelessness didn't last long, though.  

The third month came, and I was driving through the midwestern region of the country in an RV I'd stolen so I could experience van life like those influencers but without the risk and the money. I was going to the east coast because I wanted to stay in a beach house. My cousin liked renting them in Virginia, Florida, and the two Carolinas, and I’d always wanted to experience them. Of course, Autumn had come and winter was starting (or should've been at least), but it was still warm enough for a dip in the sea. Global warming, I guess. 

Anyways, night came and I stopped in some random city, choosing an upscale hotel to stay in. Highest floor, biggest room, and a hoard of food from the kitchen, all to myself. I slept like a baby, listening to a podcast, with the flat screen TV playing some reality show. The lights always stayed on, and in this case, it was two bright table lamps, one on each side of the king sized bed, and a standing lamp in the corner. 

I woke up in the middle of the night to complete darkness and utter silence. The TV was off, so were all the lights. The curtain was drawn over the glass wall which showed a beautiful view of the city, when I was sure I had left them open to look at the dazzling lights of the skyscrapers. 

Instantly, I sat up and started breathing heavily, knowing in my heart that my good time was over because the electricity was now gone. I figured I may as well just go back to sleep until daybreak, and then go and steal flashlights from the nearest store for the next night or something, but I wanted to open the curtains first. I guess I must've forgotten that I closed them… I pulled them aside, and my heart skipped a beat as I noticed something. 

The buildings in the city were still lit up. The energy still worked. I scrambled in the dark, pressing the power button on the bedside lamp. Nothing happened, so I felt for the chord, which had been unplugged. I plugged it back in and the lamp turned on, glowing a soft yellow. Upon a quick investigation, I realized all the lamps had been unplugged, and the remote to the TV was perched on the dresser across from my bed, even though I fell asleep with it on my nightstand. 

Then it hit me, all at once. It felt like the breath had been knocked from my lungs, and I immediately started to tremble. 

Someone had been in this room, while I was asleep. 

And while that should've made me excited to discover another human, it terrified me instead. Because whoever it was decided to fuck with me and leave me in complete darkness, rather than rejoice in the fact they had found another survivor. And if they would truly choose to scare me like this even though I could very well be the only other human left on earth, what type of person were they? Had they gone insane? Were they dangerous? Or was this simply proof that all of this was a hoax and they were now messing with me because I had started to make the best of my situation and that was too boring for the cameras? 

I honestly hoped to God the last part was the answer, because while that would be the meanest hoax ever conceived, at least the nightmare would be over. But not so deep down, I knew the prank theory was utterly stupid, and wrong. I mean, even if it was possible, no prank would go on this long. I just wanted to believe that over my terrifying reality. 

After I turned the lights and TV back on, I noticed the door was open, showing the dark hallway. Now, I'm not the strongest or the bravest, but I knew I had to do something, I couldn't just go back to sleep. I gathered some stuff and used the light of my phone to navigate my way through the now dark hotel building, turning on the lights as I went. 

“Hello?” I called out. “Is anyone there?”

When I got to the kitchen, I took a big carving knife with me, just in case. The dead silence unnerved me to absolutely no end. I searched every room, using keys from the office behind the lobby. It took a while, looking inside closets and bathrooms, but eventually I was able to confidently say that whoever unplugged the lamps in my suite was no longer in the building. I didn't know how to feel about any of it. Half of me wanted to be happy to the point of tears that someone was in this with me, but the other half just knew this wasn't good news at all.

I trusted my gut and decided to leave. 

I got in the RV and drove until daybreak, putting as much distance between me and that place as possible. I became exhausted and parked in the most crowded parking lot I could find, so I'd be hard to spot, then fell asleep. When I woke up in the middle of the afternoon, I started a regular day, trying to put the previous night past me. I toured this city I’d never been to before and browsed a selection of name brand clothes like Gucci and Prada that I would normally never be able to wear as a broke college student. I looked like a celebrity or some fashion model as I explored, looking for any sign of life. One of the things I missed the most was animals, like seeing someone walk their dog or watching a cat nap in a windowsill. 

When I returned to the RV at sundown, I was met with a disturbing sight. The door to the RV was wide open, and almost everything was out of place. The covers on the bed were strewn on the floor, alongside my clothes and the food and items I'd stolen from stores either for survival or pleasure. The cupboards were open, the faucets were left running, including the tub. And worst of all, someone doodled a smiley face in the dust of one of the RV windows. Two long vertical lines for the eyes and a curve under them for the mouth. This simple picture put so much fear in me I felt like the world was collapsing. 

Once again, someone had intruded in on my space, and deliberately left a sign that they had been there. More than one person had to be fucking with me, because how did the person from the hotel know where I was? How would they have found me so quickly? There are a million places I could be at, there was just absolutely no way they knew I'd be in this one city in this one parking lot. If there was more than one person, then why were they doing this? What did they want? Why don't they just come up to me and talk like a normal human being, so we can figure this shit out together? 

I think that's when paranoia first hit me. Sometimes I don't think I'm paranoid, and sometimes I do. I don't fucking know, okay?! I feel like I'm going crazy. 

Well, that's when I first started having irrational thoughts like, *Who says it's a human to begin with?* And *If it is a human, who says they want to figure anything out? Maybe they know more than you do about why the world is like this, and they know it's unfixable, so they're deciding to have their sick fun with you because, let's face it, who's around to stop them?*

The human brain can be so intelligent, but also so masochistic. Mine was torturing me with all these thoughts until I felt like I couldn't breathe. I decided to pack a bag of the stuff I've hoarded since day one and abandon the RV. I can't count how many times I looked over my shoulder as I left to find another car, I felt watched. 

Once again, I found a vehicle parked with the doors unlocked, small and black which is definitely more inconspicuous than a hulking RV. The keys were, as usual, inside, and once I got to driving away from that city, it felt like I had a breath of fresh air. However, I wasn't going to keep that car for long, because if whoever did that was around to see me get into it, I didn't want them to be able to recognize the car in whatever place I went next. This time, I stayed on the road all day, only stopping to relieve myself at a convenience store and get gas. I tried to appreciate the sights I drove past, but I couldn't stop thinking about the Stranger, which is what I had decided to call him or her. 

It wasn't long then until I would reach the east coast, but night came and I had to sleep. I didn't want to give up comfort just yet, but I was also extremely nervous that I had been followed, although I saw no other cars driving on the road. Instead of sleeping in upscale hotels, I decided to change things up a bit, so I wouldn't be as predictable to the Stranger. I considered sleeping in a crappy, rundown motel, but I wanted to be absolutely sure they wouldn't know my next move. 

I parked miles away from my destination, and using Google Maps which thankfully was still functioning normally, I walked there using back alleys. The sliver of rationality remaining in my brain told me that there's no way they were in that small town without me seeing them following me in a vehicle, but I was taking no chances. I found a big grocery store, took the keys out of a random car in the parking lot that I was gonna use the next morning, and decided to gather some covers from the domestic section and crash in one of the back offices of some manager. I locked the door,  made a pad on the floor, and turned out the light. I ate a dinner of chips and candy, rather than microwaving or cooking something that would release a smell which would indicate my location. 

It was hard getting to sleep, but I managed, trying to quietly listen to ambience soundtracks on YouTube with a Bluetooth earphone stuffed in my ear. Sleep snuck on me really, I didn't even feel myself drifting off, I was bone tired, but confident that I left no tracks and was going to be safe. 

I woke up to music, but nothing was playing on my phone. 

In fact, my phone had died, and the screen was black. 

No, the music was coming from the overhead speakers. An old tune from the 40’s or 50’s, one I faintly recognized but wasn't exactly too familiar with. 

‘We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when-’

Someone was playing this over the intercom, and it blared throughout the entire store at an almost deafening volume. I sat there on the floor swaddled in covers, shaking so hard I could barely grip my phone as I wondered if it was even safe to leave that cramped little office. That's when I figured I should've tried to find a security room to crash in, as I'd seen cameras installed on the way in earlier. Maybe I could've spotted whoever this was on the footage, but now it was too late. 

I made double sure the door was locked and then plugged my phone up to the outlet in the corner so I could at least see the time. I tried to remain as quiet as possible, in case the Stranger was still there. When I powered my phone on, I realized it was 4AM, and I decided I would not try to leave until sunrise, which should've been in a couple of hours. I just had to sit and wait until then. 

After the song ended, I heard something else play over the intercom. Someone was simply breathing into the microphone. Soft and subtle, but definitely there. The Stranger was still there, and I had no idea how they could've possibly found me. I even checked my phone to make sure my location wasn't turned on anywhere, and went through all my stuff thoroughly to be sure there wasn't some kind of airtag or tracker attached to my clothes or something. My search came up empty. 

I stayed in that back office for most of the day rather than leaving at sunrise, like a sitting duck. I was too scared to leave. Hours passed of hearing nothing, no music and no breathing, but still, I didn't dare move an inch from where I sat on the floor. I was hungry and thirsty. I felt like a child hiding under the covers from a monster in their closet, I felt foolish. Finally, I checked my phone and saw that it was evening time. I had to make a move. 

I looked for anything I could use as a weapon first, and all I found was a pen with a particularly sharp tip. I supposed I could stab someone in the neck with it. My backpack on my back, I crept out the door, and realized that once again, the lights had been turned out on me. Why? Was whoever was stalking me trying to make it easier to get the jump on me? 

I removed my shoes so that my footsteps were quiet, my socks padding on the linoleum floor. The only illumination I had was the street lamps outside streaming white, almost ghostly looking light through the big front windows of the store, and the fridges of course. When I got closer to the front of the store, where the registers were, I heard something fall off a shelf a few aisles away. Not very far at all from my position. 

I immediately crouched down and listened intently, holding my backpack so the items contained within wouldn't make a rustling noise from me jostling it around. I heard no other sounds, but I was sure the Stranger was still here. There was no way whatever that was had fallen on its own. 

Tears of fear slipped down my cheeks as I decided to abandon my backpack, deciding the contents of it were not worth the risk of it making a noise or slowing me down if I had a confrontation. I left it there on the floor as I changed directions, moving towards the back of the store to see if there was an emergency exit or back door I could exit from instead. I should've done that to begin with, but I don't tend to think too rationally when I'm scared at times. 

Indeed, all the way at the back, there were a set of double doors I could just barely make out. They were the kind that had this big silver bar in the middle you had to push to open them, and those always made a noise. I braced myself, and in one swift motion, opened the doors and slipped outside. 

Oh my god, it was absolutely freezing cold outside.

I did feel the back office get colder throughout the day, but I thought it was because of the AC or something. No, it's because it was snowing. Blankets of snow powdered the air, and the ground was quickly being painted all-white. The air felt like I had stepped into a freezer. It had just felt like summer yesterday, and at this time of day the sun was supposed to start setting, but twilight had already fully descended upon the world. The sky was black, not a star could be seen, and the moon was a tiny sliver barely visible. It was barely autumn, let alone early winter! 

While it certainly gave me a shock, I did not waste a moment thinking about the drastic change in weather. Instead, I made my way around the front and ran to the car I'd prepared to leave in. As soon as I opened the door, all the lights in the store came on, and it glowed yellow like a beacon in the dark. I froze and stared at the windows, my eyes scanning for any movement. I thought, for just a moment, that I saw a dark figure slip out of sight behind a shelf, but it was so subtle that it could've been a trick of my imagination. 

I got inside the car, shut and locked the door, ignited the engine, and drove out of that parking lot like a bat out of hell.

Once again, I cried. All I could think was, why? Why me? Why am I forced to endure this psychological torture? The only other person left here is stalking me, and I think they mean harm to me. Where is everyone? Where did you all go? Why did you leave me here by myself, with some fucking lunatic? 

WHY WON'T ANY OF YOU ANSWER MY MESSAGES?! 

Oh but don't think that's the worst part. The worst part is, it only took fifteen minutes for me to run out of gas, even though when I checked the car out the day before the tank said it was full. When I pulled over at a 7/11 to get gas, I noticed the tank was already open, as if someone had messed with it, and a tube that may have once been connected to something was sticking out still, dripping with a dark liquid. I hadn't noticed before, so desperate to get away, but 

Someone had siphoned the fucking gas! 

AND THERE'S ANOTHER FUCKING SMILEY FACE IN THE BACK WINDOW! 

It was drawn with a black marker. 

I checked the trunk and back seat, worried someone had hitched a ride without me knowing. Someone knew I was planning on using this car, and they could've definitely hid in here without me noticing it until it was too late. But they didn't. However, they did leave something in one of the back seats. 

My backpack that I had left in the store. 

How did they sneak out of there so quickly to put it in the car, then go back inside to turn on all the lights? It made no sense! No sense whatsoever! 

There has to be more than one, there has to be more than one…

I checked it. None of my things were inside. In fact, there were just 

Pictures. OF ME! 

Dozens of polaroids, showing me at various times over the past several weeks. Stealing from stores. Eating food. Scouting out cars. And even sleeping. 

In fact, there was a photo of me sleeping in the back office of that store. How THE FUCK did they get in? And without me waking up! The door was still locked when I got up!! That's impossible!!!

This was too much. I felt the entire world spin around me, but I still got behind the wheel and decided to drive as fast and far as I could. I was dizzy but I was also so, so afraid. I almost crashed a couple different times but I didn't care. I was in pure survival mode. 

That was a couple days ago. I'm writing this on my phone. I've been sleeping in my car with a knife ever since, and I plan on locating a gun store when I get to the coast so I can arm myself better, although I've no idea how to use a gun. I park my car deep in the woods at night, away from any buildings. Landmarks just make me easier to find. 

It's not long now until I get to the coast of North Carolina. I plan on getting on a boat and getting out of here. I'm not gonna do anything crazy, like sail to another continent, but I'm gonna skirt the coasts  till I get more down south. I don't feel safe traveling on land anymore. 

I'm going to keep updating as I go. This is the only thing that keeps me sane. I have hope that someone will reach out, or something will happen. I just think

1iii0oi,https://www.reddit.com/r/FireSafetyEssentials/comments/1iii0oi/this_one_fire_safety_tool_could_save_your_homeand/,This One Fire Safety Tool Could Save Your Home—And Nobody Talks About It,"Most people think they’re covered when it comes to fire safety. They have smoke detectors, maybe a fire extinguisher tucked away somewhere, and they assume that’s enough. But there’s one simple tool that’s gaining attention for its ability to stop fires fast—without chemicals, without mess, and without the hassle of traditional extinguishers.

That tool is a **fire blanket**. And if you’ve never considered getting one, here’s why you probably should.

# What Is a Fire Blanket?

A fire blanket is exactly what it sounds like—a specially designed blanket made from fire-resistant material that can smother small fires by cutting off their oxygen supply. No oxygen, no fire. Unlike fire extinguishers, which spray foam or powder that you’ll be cleaning up for weeks, fire blankets stop flames without leaving a mess behind.

The **Prepared Hero Fire Blanket** is one of the most widely talked about options for home fire safety. People are realizing it’s an easy, reliable, and effective tool for handling small fires before they become a disaster.

[**See how fire blankets fit into a home safety plan.**](https://www.djpcraze.com/8SWM4W1/DZ8JZ59/?uid=39968&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/FireSafetyEssentials)

# Why Fire Blankets Are a Game-Changer for Fire Safety

1. **No Mess, No Cleanup** Fire extinguishers work, but they leave behind chemical residue that can be toxic, especially in kitchens. Fire blankets simply smother the flames—no powders, no foam, no chemicals.
2. **Easy for Anyone to Use** When a fire starts, panic sets in. People forget how to use extinguishers, pull the wrong pin, or aim in the wrong spot. A fire blanket is as simple as pulling it out and covering the fire. No special training required.
3. **Safe for Different Types of Fires** The **Prepared Hero Fire Blanket** is effective against:
4. **Grease Fires:** Water makes grease fires worse, but a fire blanket smothers them safely.**Electrical Fires:** Fire blankets are non-conductive, making them a safer choice for small electrical fires.**Clothing Fires:** If someone’s clothes catch fire, wrapping them in a fire blanket can stop the flames fast.

# Where Should You Keep a Fire Blanket?

If you’re going to invest in fire safety, having the right tools within reach is key. Here’s where you should store a fire blanket:

* **Kitchen:** The most common place for house fires to start. Keep a fire blanket near the stove, where you can grab it quickly.
* **Garage:** Near workbenches, tools, and flammable materials.
* **Vehicle:** A compact fire blanket fits easily in a trunk or emergency kit, great for road trips or camping.
* **Near Fireplaces and BBQ Grills:** An easy way to handle flare-ups and unexpected accidents.

# Real Stories: How Fire Blankets Have Helped People

A quick search through fire blanket reviews will show you that people are using these things to stop fires before they become disasters.

* *""I was frying chicken, and the oil overheated. Flames shot up, and I knew I couldn’t use water. I grabbed my fire blanket, threw it over the pan, and within seconds, the fire was out.""*
* *""We had a BBQ flare-up that could have gone really bad. The fire blanket worked instantly. No foam, no extinguisher mess, just problem solved.""*

# Are Fire Blankets Worth It?

For the cost of a few cups of coffee, you can have a fire blanket ready in case of an emergency. They’re compact, easy to use, and require no maintenance. You never know when a fire could break out, and having a simple, reliable tool nearby can make all the difference.

Fires happen fast—but with the right tools, you can stop them even faster. Have you ever used a fire blanket, or thought about getting one? Let’s talk about it. Your experience could help someone be better prepared.",1,1738782631.0,FireSafetyEssentials,0,1.0,False

For reference, 5 years ago they were at 96 USC ($0.96) per lb.

[https://imgur.com/TUl0ZLM](https://imgur.com/TUl0ZLM)

# What does this number represent?

Coffee Commodity Futures can be considered the **base price** that a buyer (typically coffee importers) will pay to purchase a single pound of processed, un-roasted coffee seeds. This is what a coffee roasting company roasts to bring that cup of coffee to you. 

With an increase of 417% over five years, buying coffee has become an intensely stressful process. What's more is that this price has zero to do with the *quality* of that coffee. 

# Well, that's still not that much...

The C Market price is *not* what your local roaster is paying. Again, this can be considered a **base price**. On top of that is what's called a ""differential"", which represents several things, including what the producers get paid, the costs to get that coffee from the farm to the processing mill to the port of export to the port of import to the local warehouse that it is stored until it is sent to the roaster. 

Differentials have been going up as well. While there is no great way to track these, in my experience, they have risen about 400% in the past five years. A coffee that used to have a differential of $.30 will now likely have a differential of around $1.30. 

What's more is that delivery services are charging more as well. Minimum wage, space leases, electrical, natural gas - all have gone up. 

The gist of it is that it's costing over 400% more to purchase un-roasted than it did five years ago, and that's only one aspect of a coffee business.

1iihsfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1iihsfe/back_to_september_2022/,Back to September 2022,"Post covid has really been something. Everybody was out of work and the only thing open were party stores. My brother fell into the trap. In September of 2022, we found out he had 6 months to live. I tried to ask every question I thought I needed to know for the rest of my life. (Of course it’s never enough). Anyway my brother succumbed to an alcohol related death in May of 2023. You know you think that would be enough to make me stop drinking. You know, all the blood from brother’s body sitting on the counter in his room instead of in his body. I learned that alcohol has a way of breaking your body all the way down. 

The 8 months leading up to the faithful morning when he called to let me know that today was the day.  I said “to go to the hospital?” He said “no I’m going to die today. Tell everyone that I love, that I love them.”  He called back to say “I’m headed to another hospital. I’m going 110 towards another hospital.” By time I got to the hospital he was gone. 

You see. It wasn’t just that he found out he was going to die. He was in pain. Always at the hospital getting drained.  Really really good days and really really bad days. 

I still kept drinking until last summer. I hurt my back. Couldn’t walk. Drinking. That carried on until September 19, 2024. This was the I had enough moment. 

I can’t even tell you how many days I was drinking in a row but I was drinking a case a day. Everyday. So my ex-husband drives me to the emergency room for my back. I’m very much drunk. Can’t walk. Crippling anxiety. Heart burn. Acid reflux. Vertigo. Rapid heart beat. Probably sweating too. I’m thinking I’m on my way to a heart attack. I get to the emergency room. I told them I hurt my back. As I laid there. I didn’t ask for help to detox. I got everything I needed for my back and was on my way. On the way home I decided I was not going to die the same way my brother did. A quiet resolve to give myself the world because I deserve it.

Well you already know I had used all my pto time by July. Calling into work was not an option. So September 20th. I went to work with all the above side effects plus some bonus ones like shaking. Freezing cold. Sweats while cold. I asked my coworker if I used a chair as a walker would that be weird. I have to walk an 1/8 of a mile once I park. He said yes. I did it anyway. Of course I was having a money crisis at the same time. Just spiralling. 

When I think back to the earlier days of my sobriety. Just teaching myself basic skills to take care of myself. I’m blessed enough to have a place I can go to remove myself from everything and everybody. That’s what I did. Headed north. Stopped at the grocery store. I cleaned myself up. Started cooking and cleaning. My routine became working and home when I worked. Camper to teach myself how to get into a routine with myself.  

I used to make jokes like what am I going to do when I’m sober because it’s really boring.  Crochet? Color? I’ve taken up coloring, painting and drawing. It helps that I have a 5 year old granddaughter who does all that stuff with me. 

I’ve been to bars with my friends. Dinners where they are drinking. Go in the beer aisle. If someone asks I tell them what happened. I hurt my back. Had to take pills. Didn’t want to hurt anyone drinking and driving while on pills. Couldn’t walk for weeks. Once I got off the pills. I had an escape route. A way out. 

I’ve been to the doctor, dentist and dermatologist since January 1st. I joined a gym but haven’t gone. It’s alright. I forgive myself. 

Will I ever drink again? Every time I romanticize it. It would be on a beach while on vacation. Then the sick reality sets in that it won’t stop at the end of the vacation. It’ll go on days, weeks, months or years.  

Do I miss the people I was around while drinking? See the thing is I was around so many people. So many bars.  Owners of bars. I still go see some of them. They let me bring my coffee. Most places haven’t charged me if I get a coke or a coffee. I still tip though.  ",4,1738782089.0,stopdrinking,1,1.0,False

Where do I go from here?,"I (25F) started seeing a new guy (24M) who happens to live in my building about a week ago. Things have been going really well, he took me out to get coffee on our first date, we talked for hours. After the first date we had some bigger conversations about what we both want, and the risk of being with someone that is in such close proximity. We set some boundaries. I can tell he is an anxious person in general, because he will say a lot of things or ask a lot of questions that are too soon to be asking, or is something maybe you would keep to yourself when you are first starting to see someone. I am worried that we might be jumping into things too fast so I have tried not to be available all the time, and set a better schedule for seeing eachother throughout this week. He recently left a job he didn't like and has been job searching for the past month so he is unemployed but he has a degree and is fairly ambitious just in between work right now. He let me know that he wants to do more things like take me out, buy me dinner, etc. but that he just needs to wait until he's in a better place financially. I told him I understand and even offered to buy the coffee if we went out again this week. After having a little bit of back and forth conversation today he randomly said ""I might be overthinking this, but have you said thank you for anything I have bought you/us?"". This didn't sit right with me. First of all, I am sure I did, second of all I feel like I shouldn't have to be like recounting whether I'm grateful enough to someone who I am just starting to date. I don't have any track record of being greedy or selfish, and I think this text was slightly accusatory. I said ""what?"" as my reaction and he explained that he was thinking about it and he wasn't sure if I had said thank you and if I hadn't that it didn't ""sit right with him"". Where do I go from here, I am wondering if this is a serious red flag or if he is just a really anxious person. I have not replied to the last message yet.

1iihorp,https://www.reddit.com/r/lasvegassmallbiz/comments/1iihorp/8_tips_for_remote_workers_to_achieve_worklife/,8 Tips for Remote Workers to Achieve Work-Life Balance,"Around 22 million employed adults in the United States work from home 100% of the time, [roughly 14%](https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/business/hr-payroll/remote-work-statistics/#:~:text=Around%2022%20million%20employed%20adults%20%28aged%2018%20and,at%20least%20part-time%20remote%20on%20a%20hybrid%20setup.) of all employed adults in the U.S. That number will only increase as time goes on and more businesses open remote positions. With more people working from home, finding a balance between work and home life is essential! Here are eight tips to help you find that harmony.

# 1 – Develop a morning routine.

Many work-from-home (WFH) employees roll out of bed and shuffle into their home offices, but this can be an unproductive way to start the workday. Some employees don’t have a set start time and wait for motivation to strike before getting to work, resulting in procrastination and leading employees to work late to catch up. Create a morning routine that’s easy to stick to and encourage you to get up and go. Try starting your routine with an undelayable first step, such as setting the coffee machine to brew automatically, motivating you to get out of bed sooner so you don’t waste hot coffee.

# 2 – Get dressed for success!

Working from home makes it easy to go from bed to desk while still in your pajamas. However, make it a point to change out of your pajamas and into a fresh outfit every morning. Getting dressed can help you get into a working mindset and improve your mood throughout the day. Outfit changes can also make it easier to transition out of the workday. Shifting from business casual to loungewear can help distinguish between on-hours and off-hours.

# 3 – Create a designated workspace.

Designating a workspace and confining it to a specific area in your home boosts your productivity and improves your work/life balance. Separating your workspace from the rest of your home ensures that your home life doesn’t intrude on your work life. Avoid checking emails in front of the TV, and don’t spread your work out on the kitchen table. If you cannot use a separate room entirely, try finding a corner away from the high-traffic areas of your home.

# 4 – Prevent further isolation.

When you spend most of your time at home, even while working, you risk catching cabin fever. Take advantage of your video communications now that you’re more isolated. If you start feeling lonely, consider setting up a Zoom call with friends and colleagues working from home. Make plans to meet people regularly at the local cafe, your favorite gym, or a brunch date. It can be dangerously easy to stay at home constantly, so make it a point to see and interact with people regularly.

# 5 – Don’t let people intrude on your workspace.

Friends don’t just chat or hang out in the office if you’re a doctor or teacher. Drop-ins can cause you to lose focus, procrastinate, or fall behind on deadlines. Inform others that your job requires privacy and concentration like other professions. Let everyone know you’re unavailable during work hours and connect again after hours.

# 6 – Take micro-breaks.

The human body wasn’t designed to stay desk-bound for hours on end. Science has shown the value of taking “[micro chillers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2021/05/22/microchillers-on-the-fly-the-key-to-a-successful-and-robust-career/?sh=786af2556d3d)” or “microbreaks” throughout the workday. These short breaks—five minutes or less—are effective energy management strategies. These breaks can be as simple as stretching, walking up and down stairs, snacking, or having a five-minute mindful meditation. Try going outside to your garden or going for a quick walk around the block.

# 7 – Practice mindful eating.

Like many job-stressed Americans (even the ones who WFH), you hit the ground running, gobbling down a Danish and slurping down your morning joe as you scamper to your workstation. You skip lunch or eat a leftover taco while typing away at your computer. During lunch, it’s important to practice mindful eating. Sit down and give your food your attention, eating slowly and deliberately. Taste your food, reset your focus, and return refreshed to your workstation.

# 8 – Separate entirely after work.

Put away your electronics and other work tools as you would store paint brushes after finishing custom artwork or baking ingredients after making a cake. Keeping work reminders out of sight keeps them out of your mind, helping you relax and recharge your batteries.

I have a lot of videos to transcode into HEVC and have been doing so with my iGPU (HD630 from 8th Gen CoffeeLake). But its taking forever so I want to add more clients. My question is around quality comparisons of these encoders I have access to

HD530 (iGPU on older 6700K)

HD630 (iGPU on another 8th Gen CPU)

Quadro M2000 (2nd gen Maxwell with NVENC 5th Gen)

Radeon RX6800 (never used for encoding but understand HEVC is a LOT better now on Radeon as was quite poor in past apparently)

(maybe buy) Quadro P400 (Pascal with NVENC 6th Gen)

  
So, which of these is best, same or worst quality and is the worst one still okay? I'm wondering how many of these I can add to my encoding pool.

I missed 3 exams at the university because I was sick. Now I have no more than two weeks to somehow pass them all. My main problem is pretty serious depression. I still haven't started preparing for one of the exams. I have made fully prepared notes for the other two exams, but I can't force myself to learn them. It's been a long time since I've felt depressed, but now it's completely inappropriate. I believe (at least I want to) that I will pass them if I make an effort, I know I should do it, but how? My mind is filled with anything but studying. 
There is no plan B for me. I don't want to get into specifics, but every other scenario would be the end of everything, the end of me, unfortunately, I don't exaggerate. Yes, you can say that everything happens in life, that even the worst development of events is not as scary as it seems. This is true, but not in my case. It's not related to my depression, there are absolutely objective reasons for that.
It's not over for me yet, but I need someone's help. I will be very pleased if you can motivate me by finding right encouraging words, but primarily I need in practical advices.
Please, tell me if there are effective methods for disciplising yourself and how can you keep the work at the limit of my capabilities during several weeks? Apparently, I also need advice on how not to sleep. I don't drink coffee or energy drinks, but I'm ready to consider other options like tea or some medicaments.
I understand that I should sacrifice something. I'm ready to cause some damage on my sleep and health (of course, not too serious), but I should pass these exams no matter what and prove to myself that I can be stronger than circumstances at least once in my life",1,1738781796.0,helpme,2,1.0,False

Working from a traditional office or from home is no longer the only option—more and more people choose **coworking spaces**, where they can handle their tasks while staying socially connected in the heart of the city. As technology advances and demand for “smart” solutions grows, coworking spaces are evolving into true multiservice hubs, supplemented by rest areas, showers, and other conveniences typically found in camping sites. This is how the concept of **U-Point** emerged—an urban space that combines the coworking atmosphere with the comforts of a full-fledged campsite.

# U-Point: A City Campsite and Office in One

1. **Work Infrastructure** At the core of U-Point is a comfortable coworking area equipped with everything needed for productive work:
2. Open-space zones and meeting rooms;High-speed Wi-Fi and reliable networking equipment;Mobile workstations that can be easily configured for individual needs.
3. **Elements of Urban Camping** Unlike a typical coworking space, U-Point provides “camping-style” functionality right in the city:
4. **Charging stations** for all types of devices, including e-bikes and scooters;**Safety features**—surveillance cameras, electronic keycard access, and secure premises;**Showers and basic amenities** for those on the go or who commute from afar;**Relaxation areas** with a camping vibe: lounge chairs, hammocks, and picnic spots to recharge and refocus.
5. **Universal Services** U-Point’s goal is to meet as many daily needs as possible in one place:
6. **U-Food**: a mini-café or service with ready-to-eat meals and coffee stations;**U-Market**: a small store or self-service vending machines stocked with snacks, drinks, and essential supplies;**Storage areas**—from lockers for personal items to larger compartments for bulkier equipment or valuables.
7. **Flexibility and Scalability**
8. If extra workspace is needed, part of the relaxation zone can be converted into additional open-space seating;For meetings or presentations, mobile structures such as **U-Tent** can be quickly set up outdoors;Thanks to its modular design, U-Point can be deployed in various urban locations—from downtown squares to parks and waterfronts.

# U-Tent: A Mobile Solution Within U-Point

The **U-Tent** is a “smart” mobile tent that complements the U-Point concept. It can be set up anywhere on the grounds and used for a variety of purposes:

* **Quick Assembly**: lightweight design and easy transport;
* **Diverse Scenarios**: pop-up office, relaxation zone, mini-café, exhibit booth, or lecture space;
* **Technical Features**: optional solar panels, charging stations, climate control, and LED lighting;
* **Comfort**: modern materials, sound insulation, and customizable interior layouts.

# The Unifying “U” Philosophy

All solutions with the “U” prefix (You / Urban / Universal / Unique) aim to make urban living more convenient and efficient:

* **U-Bike, U-Scooter**: rentable bicycles and electric scooters parked right outside U-Point;
* **U-Wallet**: a virtual wallet storing payment methods, transit passes, and discount cards;
* **U-Home**: modular housing that can easily adapt its layout to residents’ needs.

Now, **U-Point**—an **urban space** blending a coworking experience with camping amenities—joins the list.

# The Future of Coworking and Urban Spaces

With **U-Point**, coworking is no longer just a place to open a laptop. It becomes a **universal hub** that addresses work, leisure, dining, and even personal hygiene:

* **Next-Generation Coworking**: combining workspaces with camping conveniences in a single location;
* **Time Efficiency**: everything you need—from a shower to a meeting room—is right there, eliminating extra travel;
* **Broad Appeal**: attracting freelancers, startups, and large teams that require flexible infrastructure;
* **Eco-Friendliness**: supporting green initiatives with proper waste management and renewable energy sources.

This is how the **U-trend** takes shape—built on the principles of mobility, universality, and comfort in urban environments. It’s a future where city dwellers freely choose where and how to work, relax, and grow, leveraging flexible, multifunctional spaces. And **U-Point** emerges as a new symbol of urban freedom, uniting all the essentials for an active, modern lifestyle.",1,1738781591.0,utent,0,1.0,False

Hi ladies and gents (this may pertain to the women more), I am turning 36 in July and I have a question for the fellow women in this group.

This last year I’ve had catastrophic gut health changes. I eat mostly organic food and in general I would say 80% healthy foods with a 20% not so great. 

I am active, I don’t live as heavy as I want did, but I am pretty lean with muscle. 

I was weighing about 156 to 160 at 5foot8 for the last few years . Due to some life changes in October, which were pretty devastating, and spiked my anxiety, I ended up dropping down to 140 over the following months. Quite frankly, I feel more “natural” at this lower weight. 

I have Hashimoto’s and hypothyroidism so I take a T3 and T4 every morning, which is nothing new. I’ve done this for the last 10 years.

Due to having the above autoimmune disease, I ended up going gluten-free in July to try to minimize the symptoms. I found that it helped dramatically with my bloating.  

That being said, I would say the last six months I have not felt this nauseous this much in my entire life, along with the nausea, I am nauseas to the point of puking about once or twice a month. I have no idea what it is. At one point I thought it was carbonation or my Diet Coke at night then I thought maybe when I ate out and then I thought sugar? I have no idea.

I am now at the point where caffeine is affecting me, I have been an avid coffee drinker my entire life, it has never upset my stomach and now if I finish an entire cup, my stomach feels queasy. I drank pre-workout for years and stopped this past year, so I can’t believe one cup of coffee is affecting me this badly.

The only other thing I can say that might have contribute is I had surgery back in September and I was on antibiotics after, but I can’t imagine it causing such a change? 

In general, I would say my stomach is extremely delicate and fragile these days. I feel like I used to have a stomach of steel and now I am tiptoeing like the blind in the dark having no idea what’s going on.

I was just wondering if anyone else experienced this in their mid to late 30s?

1iihjw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipping/comments/1iihjw9/is_tipping_good_for_the_economy/,Is tipping good for the economy?,"Please don’t crucify me for this take lol, I know this sub is generally anti-tipping and I completely understand why. 

I do tip (I tend to overtip when I can afford it) for two reasons. The first is that I waitressed throughout college, and good tips always made my day, especially if I had had a bad table earlier in the shift or a bad interaction with a manager or something - it feels good to “pay it forward” and know that I’m potentially helping out someone in the same position I was once in. This is an entirely selfish reason for tipping, one that I completely understand others not being on board with (I can especially understand not tipping at coffee shops or non sit-down, full-service restaurants). 

But the other reason is one I don’t see talked about as much, and I’d love to hear others’ thoughts on this. 

I’m no economist, but from my understanding of money circulation, money in the pockets of a member of the working class circulates far more than money in the pockets of the rich. When you tip a server, they’re going to be spending that money within weeks at a grocery store, or on gas, or on clothes, etc. When you don’t tip and just pay the $50 or whatever bill to Darden or some other massive company, that money isn’t being funneled back into the local economy in the same way. 

Is this a dumb take? Like I said I’m not an expert on finances in any way, but in my head it makes sense that tipping would be a good way to help keep the local economy thriving, especially when servers in particular make the majority of their paychecks from tipping. I know this would be much less applicable when considering a smaller local restaurant too, but is it valid to apply to large chains? ",0,1738781535.0,tipping,7,0.5,False

I am active, I don’t live as heavy as I once did, or work out “as hard”, but I am pretty lean with muscle. 

I was weighing about 156 to 160 at 5foot8 for the last few years . Due to some life changes in October, which were pretty devastating, and spiked my anxiety, I ended up dropping down to 140 over the following months. My anxiety is under control at this point (thank you ketamine assisted therapy!) Quite frankly, I feel more “natural” at this lower weight. 

I have Hashimoto’s and hypothyroidism so I take a T3 and T4 every morning, which is nothing new. I’ve done this for the last 10 years.

Due to having the above autoimmune disease, I ended up going gluten-free in July to try to minimize the symptoms. I found that it helped dramatically with my bloating.  

I do not take birth control, I have been “natural” my entire life as far as that goes. 

That being said, I would say the last six months I have not felt this nauseous this much in my entire life, along with the nausea, I am nauseas to the point of puking about once or twice a month. I have no idea what it is. At one point I thought it was carbonation or my Diet Coke at night then I thought maybe when I ate out and then I thought sugar? I have no idea.

I am now at the point where caffeine is affecting me, I have been an avid coffee drinker my entire life, it has never upset my stomach and now if I finish an entire cup, my stomach feels queasy. I drank pre-workout for years and stopped this past year, so I can’t believe one cup of coffee is affecting me this badly.

The only other thing I can say that might have contribute is I had surgery back in September and I was on antibiotics after, but I can’t imagine it causing such a change? 

In general, I would say my stomach is extremely delicate and fragile these days. I feel like I used to have a stomach of steel and now I am tiptoeing like the blind in the dark having no idea what’s going on.

I was just wondering if anyone else experienced this in their mid to late 30s?

I did read that hormonal changes can cause gut changes, but I have not heard or read much about similar experiences?",2,1738781233.0,WomensHealth,6,1.0,False

***The Unremarkable End*** 

For some time now, the impression has been growing upon me that everyone is already dead—not *actually* dead. But close. The kind of dead where you text your brother “Happy Birthday!!!” with three exclamation points because you forgot to buy a card, and he texts back “thnx” with no punctuation, and you both agree, silently, to stop pretending you care.

The zombies showed up on a Tuesday. Not metaphorically. Literally. They shambled into the Stop & Shop parking lot during the senior discount hour, groaning over the asphalt like overripe avocados rolling out of a produce truck. No one noticed until Gladys Keenan (69, coupon extremist, three-time divorcee) tried to haggle over the price of rotisserie chicken with one.

“You call *this* fresh?” she’d snapped, poking its grayish arm. It groaned. She sighed. “Typical.”

\---

“They’re *not* scary,” my sister Margo said. She was sitting on the porch swing, filing her nails into tiny spears. Our undead neighbor, Mr. Henderson, shuffled past the mailbox. Again. For the third time today. If zombies had routines, his was: groan at the azaleas, trip over the garden hose, groan again, repeat.

“He’s just… sad,” I said.

Margo snorted. “He still pays his mortgage. That’s sadder.”

The problem wasn’t the zombies. The problem was *us*. At first, everyone panicked, of course. Trevor Mullins (24, influencer, allergic to gluten) live-streamed himself screaming “THEY’RE COMING” while barricading his studio apartment with a floor lamp. But the zombies never came. They just… loitered. They clogged the bike lanes. They moaned in line at the DMV. They made the already-awkward small talk at PTA potlucks unbearable.

“What do we even *do*?” I asked.

Margo held up her nails, glinting in the sun. “I’m thinking vampire red. You?”

“No. About *this*.” I gestured to Mrs. Delaney (82, former librarian, now undead) struggling to parallel park her Toyota Corolla. Slowly. With her forehead.

“Same thing we do every day,” Margo said. “Wait for something interesting to happen.”

\---

The mayor called an emergency town hall in the high school gym. Attendance was mandatory, which meant twelve people showed up, plus six zombies. One wore a “I ♥ Niagara Falls” visor.

“People,” the mayor began, then paused. The PA system screeched. A zombie in the back row dropped its jaw in what might’ve been a yawn. “Fellow citizens. We must… address… the elephant in the room.”

“It’s *zombies*,” Gladys shouted from the bleachers. “Say it!”

The mayor’s eye twitched. “Fine. Zombies. They are here. They are… *mid*.”

Someone threw a protein bar.

\---

Later, over lukewarm chardonnay in Margo’s kitchen, we dissected the meeting. The zombies lurked outside, pressing their faces to the window like disappointed in-laws.

“We should at least *pretend* to fight them,” I said. “Start a support group. A Facebook page. *Something*.”

“Why?” Margo poured more wine. Her cat, Mr. Pickles, batted a zombie’s finger under the door. “They don’t bite. They don’t eat brains. They just… exist. Like everyone else.”

“But they’re *supposed* to be a big deal! It’s the apocalypse! Where’s the… the drama? The stakes?”

“Stakes?” She smirked. “You sound like Mom.”

I froze. Mom had died two years ago. Not-zombie died. Just… gone. No dramatic exit. No final words. Just a voicemail she forgot to return.

Margo stared into her glass. “Remember when she tried to ‘save’ Thanksgiving by microwaving a turkey?”

“It caught fire.”

“And she said…”

“*Well, at least it’s exciting!*” we recited in unison.

The zombies outside groaned in harmony. One of them slipped on a wet leaf.

\---

By Sunday, the town had mostly moved on. Trevor posted a tutorial called “Zombie-Chic Contouring.” Gladys tried to sell essential oils to the undead (“Lavender! For *eternal* calm!”). The mayor rented out the gym for pickleball.

Margo and I drove to the cemetery, just to feel something. The gates were open. The zombies were there too, standing politely in line at Mom’s headstone.

“What’re they doing?” I whispered.

“Paying respects,” Margo said. “Or waiting for the bathroom.”

We stood there, awkward, until Margo pulled a nail file from her purse and scratched something into the stone.

*MOM – SORRY WE NEVER CALLED. P.S. IT’S STILL NOT EXCITING.*

A zombie shuffled over, peered at the words, and groaned.

“Yeah,” Margo said. “Same.”

We left them there, milling softly in the twilight, more alive in their stillness than we’d ever admit.

\---

1iihbe4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1iihbe4/does_my_coworker_like_me_or_is_just_being_friendly/,Does my coworker like me or is just being friendly?,"I (24F) have had a crush on a male coworker (23M) for the past 7 months. The crush was more intense during the first two months but then I found out that he is in a relationship with a girl for five years (since they were both in high school). After knowing that I just lost a lot of hope; they have been together for so long (all through high school and university) and have the same friend group. I started distancing from him and interacting in a polite and friendly manner.

But what confused me was that he'd deny being in one whenever he and other coworkers would discuss relationships. And then I started noticing things that might be signs that he has feelings for me. For example:

\- He playfully teased me about the coffee I make myself during breaks.

\- I've caught him looking at me many times.

\- He laughs at almost anything I say, even if it is clearly not funny.

\- My coworkers like to play volleyball every week on Friday but on Fridays my team usually works from home while his team is in the office. So it is kind of obvious if I am in the office on a Friday, I'd come to the volley game afterwards. Still, he asks me every Friday if I'm coming for volley.

\- He compliments me a lot. E.g, how he finds my new planner cute, if I do good digging in volley, or when he liked my socks.

\- He's also very supportive when I can't serve properly during volley because I'm a beginner. He asks the other people to let me redo the serve 3-4 times without my team losing points, even if he is playing on the opposite team. Also, once when I was playing Uno flip with some coworkers (while he was just observing and not playing) and had said uno thrice, he said ""I think we should let \[my name\] win""

\- When I moan out of pain during volley when the ball hits me anywhere on my body, he looks concerned and asks me ""are you okay"". This could just be plain decency which my other coworkers don't show me every time I get hurt.

\- I've caught him mirroring my actions twice, e.g., crossing or hugging my legs if we're all sitting on the ground in a park next to our office.

\- Sometimes he likes to ask me questions about me, which could be simply out of curiosity or him trying to make conversation to avoid awkward silence when we're walking together. For example, he asked me what I did in the New Year holidays and if I've been on trips during my time in our university (we are both from the same uni but he is a batch younger and we met for the first time at our workplace).

\- We were both sitting on two aisle seats in the same row (with aisle in between) on a bus during our annual work trip. He looked at and conversed me with a lot (understandably because we were sitting so close). During a stopover at a gas station, I decided to switch buses but he said ""Are you leaving us? I think you should commit to our bus"".

Sorry for dragging this post out, but I just really needed to describe what's happening here. Since he and I only share one or two days a week in the office due to differing WFH schedules for his and my team, I can't judge his behavior with other female coworkers. Plus, he hasn't added me on Instagram even though he follows my other female coworkers.

Also, I recently found out that he broke up with his long-term girlfriend over differing future goals. But I don't think he has moved on from her yet because the break up is fresh, like two or three months old. So I'm confused if I should be interested in him even if he's attracted to me and isn't just being friendly. I don't want a guy to consider me as the next best thing; I want to be the one for him.

Please let me know what you all think. Does he like me? Does it even matter? Currently, I treat him like I treat other male coworkers: friendly, polite, but distant.",1,1738780949.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False
1iihapp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iihapp,Nam-Gyu has incredible potential (Character analysis),"
Season 2 Spoilers ahead: 

There were many standout characters in Squid Game season 2, the mysteriously devious In-Ho, the incredibly commanding yet beautiful Hyun-Ju and the hilarious but aggressive Thanos. And speaking of Thanos, there is always someone with him, practically clinging to his ankle like a dog. Nam-su, SORRY Nam-Gyu. 

So within Season 2 we don’t TRUELY get to know a lot of the ins and outs of Nam-Gyus personality, his reasons for being in the games, his goals etc, in the same way we do with the other characters. We know he worked at Club Pentagon, and may have somewhat known Thanos before the games (in the same way you probably recognise your favourite coffee barista). 
We also learn that he has an encyclopaedic knowledge of recreational drugs, using harder drugs than Thanos himself, and had dealt to him back at the club. 

Throughout the games we see him cling to Thanos like a koala to a tree (its no wonder both characters are shipped rather heavily) and a lot of people will brush it off and say he was only interested in him for the drugs he snuck in, and that IS true, but not entirely. Whether we like it or not these two assholes do have hearts, and I like to believe Nam-Gyu had grown quite fond of Thanos as the games went on, seeing him as a comrade that would stick by him and choose him in a room full of people (this is shown throughout Mingle for example) and the show heavily focuses on these characters in the games making these unforeseeable friendships and bonds, either for survival or for care for each other. Sae-Byeok and Ji-Yeong from S1 for example hadn’t known each other that well or for very long, and Ji-Yeong was willing to sacrifice her life for Sae-Byeok, and Sae-Byeok was torn over her new friends death. These small, new friendships matter in the games, it is a human survival tactic. 

“Hey wtf is your point?” i’m getting there. Bare with me. 

Nam-Gyu is shown to be a rather submissive character, a minion to an evil villian, the Gretchen Weiner to his Regina George, also sharing the same silliness and ridiculous carefree personality as Thanos. HOWEVER: By the last episode, the brawl breaks out in the bathrooms, chaos erupts throughout the halls. Thanos meets his doom at this moment, which might I mention is incredible foreshadowing for the atmosphere of next season, the comic relief of the season dying symbolises something much much darker is coming, something he can’t be around for. Nam-Gyu steals the crucifix and the fork from Thanos’s neck and flees. But something noticeably switched in him right? I can’t be the only one to notice his demeanour and his energy flipping on its head. He was, genuinely, terrifying for a few scenes. Bloodstained and bloodthirsty, he became merciless, turning on Se-Mi, who granted, he never got along with anyway, but she did help him get through the Six Legged Penthalon, which cant have meant nothing to Team Thanos. Still, he brutalised her. His actions reminded me so much of a crazed animal, like a mad chimpanzee almost. Only stopping because he had to. And I have a feeling he would have went for Min-Su too had Min-Su not hid himself away. 

Post brawl: He sits on Thanos’s bed, bloodstained and seemingly, helpless? His eyes dart back and forth as he shakily takes not one but two pills from the crucifix, cursing out his long gone friend, but tears swell in his eyes as he does so. He misses him. Noticeably again taking two pills instead of the usual one, symbolising that Thanos was the one that kept him grounded and sane, he wouldn’t have let Nam-Gyu take more than one at a time nor would he have let him brutalise Se-Mi the way he did. Nam-Gyu has been left broken and unchecked. 

My hope for his role in S3 would be just that, broken, insane and unpredictable. That he would rise above the original antagonist as something much darker and worse than Thanos ever was. His drug use continuing until he runs out, he starts to encounter withdrawal symptoms, making him worse, like a ticking time bomb, he would do something that would be of huge detriment to the rest of the cast. I want to see him go far by going so so low. All because he lost a friend. His lack of much screen time throughout most of S2 gives him the perfect angle to jump in. 

Side note: The crucifix symbolism is an incredible touch too. Telling us both boys worship it and rely on it heavily to be the way they are. And after Thanos death, it becomes a symbol of him as a person. Someone Nam-Gyu did rely on.

1iihaor,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan_travel/comments/1iihaor/vegan_travel_recommendation_asheville_nc_usa/,"Vegan Travel Recommendation: Asheville, NC, USA","Hi everyone! I am originally from western North Carolina, and I recently traveled home to visit family. As many folks know, the region was recently devastated by Hurricane Helene in September of last year. The economy in western NC, and especially in Asheville, is dependent on tourism. Losing all of the fall tourists last year has led to the closure of several businesses. 

It is safe to visit Asheville, and the city/region really needs increased tourist traffic. I was shocked at how empty the downtown area was on my visit. Even for January, it was like a ghost town. People typically love vacationing in Asheville for its natural beauty, kind people, arts culture, and mild climate. 

Asheville is an AMAZING vegan travel destination. It has a vegan scene that rivals large cities, and far outperforms my current city of Seattle, WA. I hope you'll consider a trip to Asheville this year! 

**Some vegan and vegan-friendly places I adore in AVL:**

\- [The Smokin' Onion](https://www.thesmokinonion.com/) (delicious vegan brunch!!) 

\- [Pulp + Sprout](https://pulpandsprout.com/)

\- [The Laughing Seed ](https://laughingseed.com/)

\- [Backporch Baking Co. ](https://www.instagram.com/backporchbakingco/?hl=en)(a wholesale bakery that sells to many of the coffee shops in Asheville.

\- [Gypsy Queen](https://gypsyqueencuisine.com/)

\- Most dessert places also have 3 or 4 vegan options! I recommend Old Europe or French Broad Chocolate Factory. :)

Years ago, I created [Figuro.io](http://Figuro.io) which is an online 3d modeling app. It's primarily aimed at game devs, 3d printing, general design etc. It used to have a Patreon attached to it but I abandoned that because of lack of interest from the public. Years pass and I keep on improving it as a hobby and now I find myself with, on average, 50 to 70 new registered users *a day*. Without me doing any marketing. It's just been sitting there all that time.

So 3D is picking up. I also see lots of students using Figuro for (science) projects. Even seen a few teachers creating tutorials and talking about Figuro in a podcast a few years ago.

I don't want to see this as a hobby anymore, obviously. So I added a few paid options besides the already free one. One yearly subscription for 29 dollars and one lifetime option for 99 dollars. I also limited features of the free account.

I can't be too expensive given that competition is fierce in this area. Particularly Tinkercad, which is owned by a huge company, offers similar features for free. Figuro is more advanced though, so I'm thinking I have an advantage there.

Questions I have:

\- what would you do differently in regards to the free and paid options?

\- what do you think would be the next logical step for me to take, business wise?

Cheers!

Before I hear judgement, I would just like to be heard out please 😔 

My best friend for the past 2 years is a lesbian, and has been out since high school. She has always known and has always been open about herself. We met in school, where we became super close super fast. I was always intrigued by her because she just screamed “confident” to me. We did all the normal things that normal best friends do, hang out over the weekends, get coffee, hang out after class. We have even had a couple sleepovers bc we would go out together and I wouldn’t be able to safely drive home (again, normal—I have done this MANY times with my other straight friends!!) 
It was not until probably around December 2023 that I realized I liked her as more than a friend. I came out to my husband as bi 3 months later. 
My husband and I have been together almost 10 years next week and have been married 3 in September. We’ve had some problems previously about politics mostly (me liberal him conservative), and sometimes sharing the workload of chores, but all in all we have been best friends the entire time and enjoy being with each other. When the election got closer, I pulled away from him BIG TIME because I found myself continually frustrated by his opinions. 
I started leaning on my best friend for comfort and we found ourselves getting closer than intended. She told me one night that I stayed over (again we went out and I was pretty schwasted) that she was in love with me. I cried and cried all night because I felt the same, potentially. I knew I had HEAVY feelings for her, and I love her as a person. But I cried mostly out of guilt because i put my husband in a bad spot.

I then had a 3 week emotional affair with her, telling her everything she wanted to hear and more. He found everything on my ipad. He decided to forgive me. I was relieved. However…. I have been questioning if I’m actually gay. 

I only fantasize about girls and have only fantasized about girls since I was probably 19. I didn’t realize I even liked girls that way until college. When we have sex, I picture women because that’s what helps. However, I recognize that my husband is very attractive and is good in bed. I can’t really picture my life without him, when I do I feel ??? inside and don’t even picture a life at all. It’s like my future is so tied to him that I don’t even know where to go otherwise.

I told him last night I might be gay but that I love him more than anything in the entire world and can’t even picture a future without him. However, I also can’t picture a future without my best friend, as she is truly the person who helped me discover who I am. My husband originally said we need to sleep in separate rooms and not talk to each other for a few months while I get my shit together, but I convinced him that I KNEW he was the one. Because he’s my soulmate, platonic or romantic, and I can’t lose that. 

Either way, I guess I need to figure out what the fuck is going on in my head. Even if it means being completely alone. Maybe he’s right? I don’t know. 


I guess what I’m asking is how the fuck do you live life alone? How do you live without the support and love and friendship of your partner and favorite person? Do you just cry all day every day or what? The idea of living life alone, even if only for months or even a year or two, puts a massive PIT in my stomach and it’s hard to even go to work without feeling ??!! 
How do you move on and completely 180 your life like that? My life and his life are so enmeshed it’s like…. there’s not a way to untangle it? Idk. Help a confused girl out 😭😔",5,1738780716.0,latebloomerlesbians,3,0.86,False

They ended up pretty damn tasty and the second with tequila/mezcal is one of my favorite drinks I've ever made. Lmk if you have ideas for names or ideas for how they could be improved. 

1. Derby Bird
- 1.5 oz bourbon  
- 0.75 oz cynar  
- 0.5 oz lime  
- 1.5 oz ruby red grapefruit 
- 0.5 oz cinamon syrup  
- Angostura bitters  

Combine all ingredients. Flash blend, serve over pebble ice. (I just shook with regular ice and dumped it all into a rocks glass with additional ice to top.)

I've always thought the brown derby is way too sweet and the idea here was to balance it and add some complexity with amaro and citrus using the junglebird format. Went with the cinamon syrup because I didn't have honey on hand and it worked really well. 

2. Needs a Name
- 1 oz Anejo
- 0.5 oz Mezcal
- O.5 oz Cynar
- 0.5 oz Cinamon syrup
- 0.5 oz Lime
- 1.5 oz Pineapple
- 0.5 oz chile-infused tequila* (float)

Combine all ingredients except infused tequila. Flash blend, pour into rocks glass over pebble ice. (I just shook with regular ice and dumped it all into a rocks glass with additional ice to top.) Gently pour infused tequila on top for float. 

*For the infusion I added a handful of shredded Arbol, guajilo, and new mexico chiles, a tsp of course ground coffee beans, and two cinnamon sticks to 12 oz of blanco tequila and let sit for 8 hours before straining and storing in a clean mason jar. 

This one is inspired by some of the flavors in another redditor's mole-groni (ill try to link it in the comments). Im not sure if this still reads as mole at all with the pineapple and without a chocolate component (i didn't have any good chocolate ingredients to experiment with) but damn is it delicious.

I currently have a Fellow Ode w/SSP brew burrs. I've had this grinder since about 2022--the roaster I worked for at the time received it to collect data for Fellow, and I've kept it since. I am not loving the coffee on it, and I'm wondering if it is an issue of expectations or the grinder itself.

For reference, I have a background working for cafes / roasters that roast very light and brew to maximize extraction. I'm used to hyper-aligned commercial grinders for both espresso and filter. I did not brew coffee at home extensively (only on the weekends) until recently when I started a position in a different industry and no longer have access to incredible coffee every day.

I'm brewing using Switch, Aeropress, and the April brewer. All my brews with the SSP brew burrs since I've gotten the grinder taste pretty sharp. I like acidic, light coffees, but they taste like straight up acid without any clarity, even at 23%+ extraction. When I decrease extraction, there's even less clarity, and they taste like generic acidic coffee water. I've also tried using TWW (light roast) diluted in half to see if it's a water issue, and that has not helped.

The only two potential issues here that I see are:

* The grinder is not aligned -- I love coffee, but I don't love home brewing enough to go crazy over alignment at home, so if this is the case I'd rather upgrade to a grinder that is better aligned out of the factory
* I do not like the SSP MP burrs -- not sure if this is the case, as I've used and loved coffee off 98mm MP burrs on a hyper-aligned EK, but I also (ironically) do like lighter roasted coffees brewed with a heavier balance / body, so not opposed to a different burr set

What are everyone's recommendations? What grinders are considered another 'step up' from the Ode better designed for alignment? Should I buy the stock Ode v2 burrs? Should I check the alignment on my Ode first (and are there any good guides for doing so)?

To be clear, I'm not expecting cafe-quality coffee at home. I just want to be able to brew above-average light roast coffee at home, and I would not consider what I'm currently brewing 'above average.' Thanks for any input!",3,1738780341.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

I am 40 years old and I was not exactly very compliant with annual check ups. I have never gone to the doctor for exactly 20 years. I never felt sick, fairly felt ""healthy"" otherwise. Until 2 years ago, I kept on getting Covid, Flu, Covid, Flu, Common Cold, Pneumonia - just one after the other. The stress didn't help since I am a nurse and also my husband passing away. I had a medical scare back in September 2024 and my doctor chewed me out for not having PAP done ever.  So long story short, I had PAP smear done in October 2024 - result didn't look good, I had Colposcopy done - and as predicted, it was CIN3. My doctor said I probably had this for at least 7 years. (Me ignoring symptoms like bleeding post-intimacy) My immune system is down- getting COVID and flu at least every 6 months in the last 2 years didn't help with my CIN3. Fast forward today, I am exactly 7 days post LEEP. It was done under general anesthesia. This really gave me anxiety from the moment I found out because I have never had surgery before. I had an impression it can be done in a doctor's office. The day of the ""mini-surgery"",  all I remember was the anesthesiologist giving me Versed, I was able to stay awake long enough to transfer myself to the OR table, next thing I remember, the anesthesiologist waking me up telling me it was done and they were wheeling me back to PACU. I was also intubated (they gave fentanyl, toradol, dexamethazone, zofran, lidocaine, propofol - the anesthesia cocktail). I didn't feel any pain at all for the first 4 days, then afterwards just mild cramping here and there. A little fatigued but getting better each day! Watery discharge on the first 2 days and it slowly transitioned to the usual black coffee ground discharge. I wouldn't have done it any other way! Doing it under general anesthesia is the way to go especially if you have high anxiety like me. 

To all the ladies, please do not be like me. Get checked regularly! I have not received the result from the LEEP yet, but I am hopeful to get negative margins. I have no children and I am not about to start popping out babies at 40. I told my doctor on my Pre-OP appointment to just take it all out, obviously it didn't happen. Everything has been smooth so far and hopefully stays that way.

Listen up, fellow reptiles and exotics—I’ve seen things. I’ve been places. But nothing compares to today.

It started like any other morning. Mom stuffed me into her pocket before rounds. Standard procedure. I usually just nap, but today? Today was different.

The air smelled… off. Stale coffee. Antiseptic. Stress sweat. I knew we were in The Place. The one where Mom talks forever and forgets I exist. I peeked out—just a bunch of big hairless creatures staring at glowing rectangles. One of them noticed me. Uh-oh. Time to hide.

Mom started talking, and I figured, okay, nap time. But then she kept talking. And talking. I was getting bored. So, I peeked out again. Boom—eye contact with Rectangle Guy. He looked shook. Not my problem.

Then Mom introduced me! “Oh, Guiessepie wants to say hello!” Yeah, okay, cool. But now all these faces are looking at me. Uncomfortable. I tried to retreat, but then—THEN—Mom started talking about being a “hobby herpetologist.” Bro. We do not need my entire life story right now.

I decided to take action. Freedom was right there. So, I jumped.

Perfect arc, 10/10 form, stuck the landing… right onto some poor human’s lap. She screamed. I panicked. She clawed at me. I bolted. Pure instinct. Hit the floor, went full sprint mode. Humans screaming, chaos erupting.

Now I’m loose in a giant maze of white walls and weird smells. Every time I pause, I hear “WHERE IS HE?!” echoing in the distance.

I am speed. I am shadow. I am free.

But also… I am a little hungry. And slightly regretting my choices.

If anyone sees this, send bugs. And maybe tell Mom I’m sorry.

The air is crisp but not cold, the kind that smells of damp earth and something unnameable, like the space between dreams. I wake naturally, no alarm, just the gentle pull of consciousness from sleep.

There's a moment where I lie still, eyes half-lidded, listening. The house breathes with me - wood settling, pipes sighing, the distant murmur of wind curling around the eaves. Nothing feels out of place, but I hesitate before putting my feet on the floor.

I dress in soft, well-worn clothes, comfort over formality. The kitchen is warm, filled with the scent of freshly brewed coffee. I pour a cup, letting the steam rise against my face as I watch the morning unfold through the window. The trees in the distance sway, but the branches closest to the house are strangely still. A single crow perches on the fence, watching me. When I blink, it's gone.

Breakfast is unhurried - eggs, toast, jam for something sweet. I eat in silence, except for the occasional creak from the ceiling above. The house is old; it makes noises. But this one is different, a rhythmic sound, like footsteps pacing just out of sight.

The day stretches ahead, full of possibility. Writing comes first. I settle into my chair, fingers poised over the keyboard. The words flow easily, almost too easily, as if something else is guiding them. Sentences form that I don't remember thinking. I check the time and frown - hours have passed in what felt like minutes.

A walk is next, through a landscape that feels just shy of familiar. The trees are taller than I recall, the sky a shade deeper. A figure stands at the edge of my vision, still as stone. When I turn to look directly, there's nothing there but shifting shadows.

Back home, I paint. My hands move with certainty, but the image that emerges is unsettling - a door in the middle of an empty field, slightly ajar. I don't remember deciding to paint this.

Evening falls, the kind that comes too quickly, swallowing the light before I'm ready. The wind picks up, rattling against the windows like fingers drumming impatiently. I make dinner, but it seems like more food than necessary, as if I expected company. The chair across from me remains empty, but I swear, just once, I hear it creak.

Night brings reading, a thick novel full of unsettling prose. The pages blur at the edges, words twisting into meaning I don't quite understand. The house is quiet now. Too quiet.

I settle into bed, pulling the duvet tight. Just as sleep starts to take me, I hear it.

The sound of breathing.

Not mine.

Paris is home to some of the most iconic landmarks in the world, and you can’t visit the city without seeing at least a few of them. The Eiffel Tower, standing tall at over 300 meters, is the most famous of them all. Whether you admire it from the ground or take the elevator up for a panoramic view of the city, it’s sure to take your breath away. Then there's the Louvre, one of the largest and most famous art museums in the world. Spend hours wandering through its halls, home to masterpieces like the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo.

The grand Arc de Triomphe, with its elaborate sculptures, is another must-see that sits proudly at the center of the famous Champs-Élysées.

# 2. Charming Neighborhoods

Paris is made up of 20 districts, or arrondissements, each with its own unique character and charm. Take the time to stroll through different neighborhoods to get a true feel for the city.

Le Marais, located in the 3rd and 4th arrondissements, is a historic district known for its narrow streets, beautiful courtyards, and trendy boutiques. If you're into art and culture, you’ll love the Latin Quarter, which is home to the famous Sorbonne University and numerous charming cafés. For a more relaxed vibe, head to Canal Saint-Martin, where you can watch boats glide down the canal while sipping coffee in one of the cozy cafés lining the banks.

# 3. Culinary Delights

Paris is a food lover’s paradise. The city is brimming with bakeries, cafés, and patisseries offering delectable French treats. Start your morning with a buttery croissant or a freshly baked pain au chocolat, and pair it with a rich café au lait. No visit to Paris is complete without tasting a crepe, and you can find them in stands throughout the city, with fillings ranging from Nutella to savory ham and cheese.

For lunch or dinner, indulge in a classic French bistro meal. Try escargot or duck confit, and don’t forget to pair your meal with a glass of fine French wine. And for dessert? A light and fluffy macaron is a must-try, as is a slice of indulgent chocolate mousse or a crème brûlée.

# 4. Iconic Parks and Gardens

While Paris is known for its bustling streets, it also offers plenty of green spaces where you can relax and unwind. The Jardin des Tuileries, located between the Louvre and Place de la Concorde, is a perfect spot for a leisurely stroll or to sit by the fountains and take in the surrounding beauty. The Luxembourg Gardens, with its manicured lawns and statues, offers a peaceful escape in the heart of the city.

I’ve always been a little skeptical about at-home teeth whitening kits. There are so many products out there—whitening strips, charcoal toothpaste, LED kits—and they all promise the same thing: a bright, white smile. But do they actually work?

After dealing with coffee stains and dull teeth for years, I finally decided to try **Laughland teeth whitening** to see if it could make a real difference. The idea of a **dentist-formulated whitening gel** paired with an **LED light** sounded more advanced than the typical drugstore stuff, so I figured it was worth a shot. Here’s how it went.

# What’s Inside the Laughland Kit?

When my kit arrived, I was relieved to see how simple it was. No complicated steps or extra gadgets—just the essentials:

1. **Whitening Gel Pens** – Twist, apply, and go. Super easy to use.
2. **LED Mouthpiece** – Helps activate the whitening gel and boost results.
3. **Straightforward Instructions** – No guesswork, just a quick guide on how to use everything.

I liked that it wasn’t messy or complicated, and the packaging actually felt high-quality.

# How to Use Laughland Teeth Whitening

Each session only takes **10 minutes**, which is perfect if you don’t have a ton of time to spare. Here’s the step-by-step process:

1. **Brush & Dry Your Teeth** – Dry teeth help the gel stick better.
2. **Apply the Gel** – Use the pen to coat your teeth evenly.
3. **Insert the LED Mouthpiece** – Pop it in, turn on the light, and wait 10 minutes.
4. **Rinse & Clean** – Once the time is up, rinse your mouth and clean the device.

Super easy. I usually did it while watching YouTube or scrolling on my phone, and the 10 minutes went by fast.

# Day-by-Day Results

* **Day 1:** No major changes yet, but my teeth felt super clean.
* **Day 3:** The stains around the edges of my teeth were starting to fade.
* **Day 6:** My teeth looked **6-7 shades whiter**, and the results were even—not patchy or streaky.

**The best part?** **No sensitivity.** I was expecting at least some discomfort, but I didn’t feel any pain or weird sensations, even after drinking cold water.

# What Makes Laughland Different?

1. **Dentist-Formulated Gel** – It’s designed to remove stains without damaging enamel.
2. **LED Light Activation** – The light speeds up the whitening process and ensures even results.
3. **Temperature-Controlled Ingredients** – The gel is stored properly so it stays effective, unlike some drugstore products that lose potency over time.

# Comparing Laughland to Other Whitening Products

* **Whitening Strips** – Work, but they’re uneven and made my teeth sensitive.
* **Whitening Toothpaste** – Good for maintenance but doesn’t actually “whiten.”
* **Professional Whitening** – Definitely works, but too expensive and left me with sensitivity for days.

Laughland gave me **professional-level results** at home without breaking the bank or making my teeth hurt.

# FAQs About Laughland Teeth Whitening

1. **Does it damage enamel?** – Nope! The formula is designed to be strong on stains but gentle on teeth.
2. **Does it work on deep stains?** – Yes, even on older coffee and tea stains.
3. **How long do the results last?** – This depends on your habits, but avoiding staining foods can help results last for months.

# Tips for Better Results

1. **Be Consistent** – Use it for all six days in a row.
2. **Limit Staining Foods** – Cut back on coffee, tea, and red wine while whitening.
3. **Brush & Floss Daily** – Keeps your teeth looking brighter for longer.

# Final Thoughts: Is Laughland Worth It?

For me, **Laughland teeth whitening** delivered exactly what it promised. It was simple to use, didn’t take much time, and—most importantly—**actually worked** without causing pain or sensitivity.

If you’ve been putting off teeth whitening because of the cost or sensitivity concerns, this might be the solution you’re looking for. It’s not as extreme as in-office whitening, but for an at-home treatment, I was **really impressed** with the results.

-----------------------------------------------------

Valentine's Day is the perfect opportunity to show appreciation for your coworkers. Finding the right gift for your colleagues can be challenging, especially when you want it to be thoughtful and creative without crossing professional boundaries. With a little imagination, you can select gifts that add joy to the workplace and strengthen your work relationships.

### Thoughtful Gifts that Speak Volumes

It’s important to choose gifts that reflect your appreciation while remaining office-appropriate. Consider these options:

- **Personalized Coffee Mugs:** Everyone loves their morning coffee. A customized mug with a fun quote or their name can brighten their day.
- **Desk Plant:** A small succulent or cactus adds life to their workspace. Plus, plants help improve mood and focus!
- **Handwritten Notes:** A simple, heartfelt note expressing gratitude for their hard work can mean a lot. Pair it with a small treat, like chocolates.
- **Office Supplies Gift Basket:** Fill a basket with unique, colorful stationery items. These can include sticky notes, highlighters, and pens in fun patterns.

### Creative Approaches to Gift Giving

In addition to traditional gifts, think outside the box! Creative ideas can spark laughter and foster camaraderie among coworkers. Here are some suggestions:

- **Candy Bouquet:** Instead of flowers, create a bouquet made of their favorite candies. This is both creative and delicious!
- **Customized Calendar:** Design a calendar featuring office jokes, team photos, or motivational quotes that lighten the work atmosphere.
- **Funny Desk Sign:** Look for quirky desk signs that reflect their personality. A “World’s Okayest Employee” sign can add humor to their day.
- **Game-Centered Gift:** Consider including a small game for breaks or lunchtime fun, like a mini tabletop game, which promotes team bonding.

### Making it Personal

Personalizing your gifts can truly enhance the thoughtfulness behind them. Consider your coworkers’ interests and hobbies:

- **Cookbook for Food Lovers:** If they enjoy cooking, a unique cookbook can inspire tasty lunch recipes they can bring to the office.
- **Scented Candles:** Choose scents that soothe or energize, allowing them to enjoy a relaxing atmosphere at home after a busy workday.
- **Personalized Phone Stand:** A phone stand with their name or a fun design can be a practical yet thoughtful gift, perfect for their desk or home office.
- **A Fun T-Shirt:** Find a t-shirt that showcases their favorite band, movie, or a funny office saying they can wear on casual Fridays.

### Experience-Based Gifts

Sometimes, the best gifts are experiences rather than items. Consider these for your coworkers:

- **Lunch Gift Card:** Treat them to lunch at a local eatery. This encourages relaxation and gets everyone out of the office for a bit.
- **Workshop Tickets:** Check local events for interesting workshops like painting, cooking, or pottery they might enjoy.
- **Team Outing:** Organize a fun outing for your team, such as bowling or an escape room experience. It's a great way to bond outside of work!

### Respecting Different Comfort Levels

Always keep in mind that not everyone may feel comfortable receiving gifts, especially in a work environment. It’s essential to read the situation and respect your coworkers’ preferences. Sometimes a shared treat for the whole team, like cookies or a cake, can be a great way to celebrate the occasion without putting anyone on the spot.

Gift-giving among coworkers can strengthen team relationships and create a more positive work environment. By choosing gifts that are creative and thoughtful, you can express gratitude in a way that resonates personally. Explore these suggestions to find the perfect Valentine gifts for your coworkers, and make this Valentine's Day one to remember!

Building Workplace Morale with Valentine's Day Celebrations
-----------------------------------------------------------

Valentine's Day is often hailed as a celebration of love and affection, but it can also serve a deeper purpose in your workplace. By incorporating Valentine's Day celebrations, you can significantly enhance workplace morale. This not only fosters a sense of community but also contributes to a more vibrant and productive work environment. Below are several methods and ideas to make the most of this romantic holiday in a professional setting.

### Embrace Festive Decor

One of the easiest ways to lift spirits in the office is through decor. Transform your workspace by adding some Valentine-themed decorations:

- **Heart Garlands:** Hang colorful heart garlands in common areas to instantly create a cheerful atmosphere.
- **Valentine's Day Wall Art:** Use quotes about friendship and love on posters to inspire positivity.
- **Desk Treats:** Encourage coworkers to decorate their desks with little trinkets or themed items.

These small touches can make a big difference in how employees feel when they arrive at work.

### Organize a Secret Valentine Exchange

A secret gift exchange can provide excitement and engagement. Much like a workplace ""Secret Santa,"" colleagues can draw names and exchange thoughtful gifts anonymously. To make it inclusive, set a reasonable budget and provide guidelines on what types of gifts are suitable. This creates anticipation, makes employees feel appreciated, and encourages teamwork and interaction.

#### Tips for a Successful Exchange

- **Set Clear Rules:** Define the budget and deadlines for gift selection.
- **Suggest Gift Ideas:** Provide examples ranging from office supplies to fun, light-hearted gifts that coworkers would enjoy.
- **Encourage Inclusivity:** Consider including treats for those who may not celebrate Valentine's Day traditionally.

### Host a Themed Potluck or Lunch

A Valentine's-themed potluck lunch can be a delightful way to bring everyone together. Invite coworkers to bring in their favorite dishes, and consider suggesting a red, pink, or heart-themed menu to get everyone in the love spirit.

#### Benefits of a Potluck: 

- **Community Building:** Sharing food creates opportunities for conversations and bonding.
- **Diverse Flavors:** It showcases the different culinary skills and tastes of your colleagues.
- **Time to Relax:** A lunch break offers a much-needed respite from work, helping to rejuvenate employees.

### Creative Team Activities

Engaging in team activities can enhance collaboration while injecting fun into the workday. Here are a couple of ideas:

- **Arts and Crafts Station:** Set up a crafting station for employees to make their own Valentine cards. These can be shared or exchanged among coworkers, fostering creativity.
- **Valentine Trivia:** Organize a fun trivia game about love, friendship, and Valentine's Day traditions. This can serve as a fantastic icebreaker and promote friendly competition.

These activities encourage teamwork and help employees relax while having fun together. Plus, they can spark interesting conversations and build closer relationships among team members.

### Highlight Acts of Kindness

Encourage employees to perform random acts of kindness throughout the week leading up to Valentine's Day. This could include leaving a kind note on a colleague’s desk or surprising someone with coffee. Recognizing and promoting these acts creates a culture of gratitude and positivity in the workplace.

#### How to Encourage Participation:

- **Bulletin Board Ideas:** Create a ""Kindness Wall"" where employees can share their acts of kindness anonymously.
- **Daily Challenges:** Send out daily suggestions for small acts of kindness to inspire everyone.
- **Group Acknowledgment:** Acknowledge contributions in a team meeting to emphasize the importance of kindness.

By weaving Valentine’s Day celebrations into your workplace, you’re not just acknowledging the holiday; you’re creating a more connected and joyful environment. These events and activities can uplift employee spirits and foster greater team collaboration—making work a little lighter and a lot more enjoyable.

### Conclusion

Valentine's Day is not just about romantic love; it is an opportunity to strengthen the bonds we share with our coworkers. By choosing creative and thoughtful gifts, you show appreciation for their hard work and camaraderie. Whether it's personalized items, fun office decorations, or tasty treats, each gift can express a sentiment that goes beyond the usual workplace interactions. Engaging in this tradition fosters a positive atmosphere and encourages a spirit of kindness among team members.

Celebrating Valentine's Day in the workplace can significantly boost morale. When colleagues feel valued, they are more likely to collaborate effectively and contribute to a harmonious environment. It is vital to consider the unique dynamics of your office when organizing celebrations or gift exchanges. Tailoring your approach to fit your team's culture creates a more inclusive and enjoyable experience for everyone.

By embracing Valentine's Day as a chance to celebrate cooperation and friendship, you can enhance relationships and promote a supportive atmosphere. So, this year, take the time to select gifts that resonate with your coworkers, host a fun gathering, or simply share a heartfelt note. These small gestures can lead to a more connected and engaged workplace, ensuring that every member feels appreciated and valued. Remember, a little kindness goes a long way in creating a thriving office culture that benefits everyone. Happy gifting!",1,1738779948.0,LuxuryGiftsf,0,1.0,False
1iigw07,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1iigw07/pcos_depression_weight_diet_i_dont_know_anymore/,"PCOS? Depression? Weight? Diet? I don't know anymore, please help me.","This is will be a very long post about my issue including backstory, medications and symptoms, please bear with me. (English is my second language) 

So, to begin with the mandatory details, I am a 19F, 174cm or 5 feet 7 inches tall, I weigh around 93kg, and I don't drink, smoke or consume recreational drugs. I am from India and for my current condition, I am under homeopathic medication that I don't even know the name of because my family deems that it is unnecessary for me to know. To give some context, most of the families in the country are restrictive about the child's autonomy to make decisions and financial resources (at least for me). Keep in mind that part time jobs for high school and college students is not a concept here because families are expected to provide for them until they get a job. 

With that out of the way, this all started happening when I was 16 years old, during covid. I was not in the best mental state; anyone with a pair of eyes, except my parents, could tell that I was depressed and that is when I stopped menstruating, consequently, I started gaining weight. To tackle this problem, my parents resorted to homeopathic medicine and that didn't do anything. So, after a year, we consulted a gynaecologist and we shared our concerns. The doctor conducted an ultrasound and found out that everything was normal. I had no cysts in my ovaries or anything of that sorts, it's just my endometrium lining was a bit thick (now I don't remember how thick because my files are with my parents and I don't know where they are and they wouldn't let me look at it without asking multiple questions and I can't let them know I am seeking advice from reddit). So, in conclusion, the doctor said to engage in weight loss and diet control; no medications, no reference for a blood test, nothing, nada. 

So, for another year, my parents made me join yoga classes and zumba classes, while I was mentally and academically struggling because I was forced to study for med school. There was no change in my weight, or menstruation (I also want to mention that I was suicidal). When I was in twelfth grade, 17 years old, I briefly got my periods for a few months; I was under no medication and I wasn't exercising.  I avoided home as much as possible by attending school in the morning and attending cram school for the med exam and not returning home before 10 pm. I ate less and survived on energy drinks and coffee (also I gained good friends). But that stopped when I stopped going to cram school on daily basis (exam seasons). 

And I didn't get my periods after that. 

We consulted another gynaecologist when it was a few months into my college and she also stressed on weight loss and diet control. The only diet I ever have is whatever my parents made and gave me, and I have tried weight loss in different ways. But then, the doctor asked me if I exercised daily and whether I was consistent. I told her truthfully that it was difficult for me to exercise daily but I tried my best to make sure I was active for at least five days a week. Also, I mentioned that it is difficult for me to spare time for exercising during exam period, because I am burnt out and everything mentally drains me. But, of course, I had to mention everything without including my mental state because nobody here considers that and my parents don't want to believe that I am truly struggling. They are the classic example of 'I put a roof over your head why aren't you grateful' kind of parents. So, this doctor blames me about not prioritising my health and making me feel that I was irresponsible. Other than that, she took an ultrasound and the reports were normal apparently again, just the endometrium was thick. The doctor then prescribed me a bunch of medications which I cannot figure out what it says because the handwriting is terrible but it says, Myobless Ovg and Polyvam? There are more, but I can't make out what is written and I don't have the medicines anymore. With those medications, I was able to menstruate again and losing weight without exercising. However, side effects included: less eating, less sleeping despite my insomnia already, and mood swings. These medications were supposed to be repeated every month, with some of them to be taken regularly after meals and some of them to be taken weekly. 

While I was under this doctor's treatment plan, my parents were consulting another gynaecologist who lived in another city but had family connections with. She said that those medications were too strong for me and that the doctor was stimulating my hormone secretion to a high degree and then she told me to stop taking those medications and have birth control pills instead for 21 days straight? That didn't help with my periods anyways, it just stopped again. 

We went to get another ultrasound; the doctor who was doing the ultrasound said that there was nothing wrong with my uterus. He also did my abdominal scan and found out grade one fatty liver, which made me anxious about whether I had diabetes or not. But then again, no one in my family has any history of diabetes and my blood reports (which I took three times) were normal. My vitamins, minerals, proteins, endrogens, testesterone, blood sugar levels, etc. everything was normal (see to it that cortisol levels were not measured). 

So, the out of town gynaecologist my parents were corresponding with, suggested to meet up with an endocrinologist. So, we did. The body examination he did was check my weight, height, the hammer reflex test thing, abdomen check (probably to check the bloating), blood pressure (which was normal), and growth of my hair on my face (which was minimal except for a stray growth of hair strand on my chin). The doctor also stressed on weight loss and diet control. By that time, I had joined gym and exercised for an hour almost everyday without any significant result. My parents banned snacks in the house and we rarely ate out, and I was frustrated. 

I discussed with my mom that I should consult a psychiatrist or a psychologist, and even have my cortisol levels tested, because, it could also be a psychophysiological thing but, my suggestion was disregarded and I was blamed for my condition by my parents again. I have limited financial resources and the money that I have is just enough to cover my travel costs to college. I cannot get myself a job because I have odd college timings which begin from 1:15 pm to 5:45 pm and I don't have time to spare. 

It's almost been a year now since I got my periods and I can't help but get more worried as time passes. I don't have a trusted adult to rely on or for them to convince my parents to consider other possibilities or factors for my condition. 

Which is why, I am here on reddit, posting this under this subreddit because I don't know where else I could talk about this. 

I also don't know my diagnosis either. A few doctors said I have PCOS but others say I am completely normals. Please help me. Also, thank you for reading it till the end. ",1,1738779917.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Why am I having such a difficult time finding employment, specifically jobs I actually wanted in the government field? Bc other jobs, like from indeed etc. I would get called back but they were not really what I was looking for, Or the pay was bad etc. well I guess I forgot that I had my current supervisors contact info In my gov jobs account and she was a reference too. So I started to question... Is she the one to blame? Is she telling these jobs bad things about me? Mhm.. Well eventually she placed me on a Performance Plan. And honestly I thought it was such a tacky thing to do especially due to the fact that I was placed on the plan literally the week I came back from being out due to surgery… any who, I started reading about Performance plans and about peoples experiences with them, a lot suggested I start applying elsewhere bc this is basically the last step before I get fired.. Which I did I applied to jobs like crazy. And again I kept getting rejections or no responses at all. Well I talked about this with a colleague and she told me to check if I have her as a reference and delete her which at this point I genuinely forgot and I thought jobs only wanted or reached out to references if they r considering u for the job not before they even reach out to you. So I go and delete her as a contact. Well time passed... And one day MY Supervisor told her supervisor that she knew I have been applying to other positions because she gets the reference questionnaire/ calls. My supervisor told her supervisor that she calls these company’s back and basically tells them she does not recommend me because “she does not want these companies to go through what they have gone through with me. So because I got ill, and had multiple doctor’s appointments, 2 surgeries in 2024 and felt like absolute garbage the whole year she thinks I don’t deserve a job here or anywhere else. I also do the majority of the work here that they don’t want to do. She doesn’t want to train me in the “harder” or more important tasks because “I don’t know anything” yet she has made me TRAIN the new hires they hired instead of me. She makes me go and pick up coffee for her. And no matter how open I try to be about the issues I might be having here or at home she just doesn’t care. And for a long time, they made me feel isolated, they were rude and condescending when I don’t know how to do something and ask for help and for a long time I stopped asking for help and did make more mistakes but in my head that was better than getting a dirty look or half ass answers. Her and her favorite coworker ( who I suspect is family somehow with her) have been so rude to me from telling me I sound like a man and laughing super load when I was sick and lost my voice to asking me question like “are u married” and when I answer no they laugh and giggle together. Very weird and I brushed it off and focused on my work. I guess I wanted to vent, it feels kind of good to realize that it was not in ur head and they’re mistreating me but it sucks to know that not only does she want to mess me up in my current role but she is also trying to close doors outside of here. She treats everyone else very poorly, and I’m happy to have other coworkers who are actually enjoyable to work with and care. Any suggestions?

But here’s the story—there’s a newly hired girl in his company who’s a relative of their boss. Honestly, from the start, there was already something fishy going on. Then may times lang nag nag aask ako about them sa work ganyan and he mentioned this girl and story lang nakikichismis.

Nag karoon ng jowa si girl but hindi nila ka-workmate bali bartender sa coffee shop ng boss nila and yung coffeshop sa baba lang ng office nila. Then one time nanghiram ako ng phone nya and ito palang si ate girl is broken then inaasar sya nila ng bf ko and yung mga kaworker nyang lalake. Nag kukwento naman sya na inaasar nga nila yung girl then I asked him na parang normal lang pero deep inside may pangdududa na and pangiimbestiga.

Non-verbatim Me: Kawawa naman yung girl inaasar nyo. Him: Malalakas nga mga asar nila lalo na si Jomar (co-worker nya but di tunay na name) nakikitawa lang ako ee Me: Diba may jowa si Jomar? Him: Oo matagal na sila ng jowa nya nya.

Then one day, I was at his house working from home while he was onsite. I saw their group chat where Jomar sent a screenshot of the girl’s profile picture. The message said, “may picture na sya, naka move on na.” I noticed that my boyfriend heart-reacted to the message.

bumagsak talaga ako as in di ko alam ang mararamdaman ko to think nakawfh ako then chinat ko sya na umiiyak ako but before that sinabe ko sya kanya na may sasabihin ako sa kanya pero di ko masabi kase di ako sanay mag open up pero ayun na yung inooverthink ko everynight and questioning my worth. after that chat nag half day sya para umuwi.

When he got home, he kept asking what was wrong and why I was acting that way. He even said he took a half-day because he was worried about me.

I took a deep breath and showed him the message.

Me: Ano yan? bat may pag react dyan? Him: Wala lang yan diba sinabe ko na sayo? inaasar lang namin sya kase sabe nya nag palit na sya ng profile ibigsabihin naka move on na sya Me: Bat nyo kailangan asarin ha? yung mga asarang ganyan mga nag aabang maging single yung girl ee. alam ko na mga galawang ganyan ee Him: Hindi ako ganon tsaka may mga jowa na kame normal lang samin mag asaran. Me: Hindi ganun nararamdaman ko! tingin mo normal lang makipag asaran sa lovelife ng katrabaho? parang abang na abang ee sure kabang normal lang yan? dyan na uumpisa yan ee Him: Wala kabang tiwala sakin? kelan pa ako nag loko? Me: Hindi ko alam. hindi kase ganyan pag sa trabaho ko.

He cried in front of me to explain and give me reassurance.

but this really triggered me

Him: Bat ka nangengealam ng account ko?

But he apologized, saying he didn’t mean it and that a lot was going on at that time. He also left the group chat and unfriended the girl because she had added him. I told him the girl doesn’t know anything, so why unfriend her? It might give people the wrong impression about me.

Him: Wala na akong pakelam sa kanila ang importante yung peace of mind mo.

But yeah, it still hurts me because he said that to me. Since then, I stopped checking his chats even though we’re open about each other’s phones and respect each other’s privacy. But of course, because of what he said, there’s always this fear that he might bring it up again (it’s just me and my trauma).

After that day, we were okay, and so far, that was the only issue we fought about involving a girl.

Three months later, I accidentally saw something while scrolling through his account (as I mentioned, we’re still open with each other’s accounts, but I was just checking something important).

Back to the story — I saw Jomar’s account where he was teasing the girl non-stop. My boyfriend, who had previously told me that Jomar had a long-term girlfriend, later revealed that Jomar and the girl from their office actually ended up together.

pero inopen ko yun sa kanya ""Sila na pala ni Jomar"" nahimik lang sya

And YES! bumalik nanaman sakin yung away namin noon and gusto ko sanang ipamukha sa kanya na ""Ano? sabi ko sayo ee. Girl instinct never fails""

and I was like ""pano kung hinayaan ko lang yun baka sila na ng bf ko ngayon"" ""papatol kaya jowa ko dun kung hinayaan ko yun"" ""Mafafall kaya sila sa isa't isa kung di ko brining up yon?"" ""Ano kaya nararamdam nung longterm gf ni Jomar"" ""Buti nalang sinabe ko sakanya agad kung hindi baka hindi si Jomar nakatuluyan nya kundi yung jowa ko""

Ayan yung pumasok sa utak ko that time and paminsan minsan naiisip ko rin sya everytime my cheating issue na involved ang coworker

But now we're happy and nag lilive-in narin kame kasal nalang kulang 😌🧿🪬

It’s a question I’ve faced countless times, with different people, at different moments. But the answer, inevitably, always comes down to the same thing:

“Yeah, but it’s just a dream. It’s not for us. Some people are meant for that, and then there’s us… just regular people.”

This sentence has stuck with me my whole life.

As a kid, I loved playing football. And like every child, I dreamed big. I imagined myself in a huge stadium, the crowd cheering, my friends and family in the stands rooting for me. I dreamed of being the best, of hearing people say, “Wow, you’re incredible!”

But the reality was that the voices around me kept repeating the same thing:

“Impossible. The people you see on TV were born that way, with special talent. You… you’re just an average kid.”

Even now, it still stings just to write it. Maybe I wasn’t as good as I thought, maybe I never would have become a champion. But that’s not the point. Hearing those words over and over made me give up before I even had a real chance to try.

Years have passed, but the feeling is still the same.

Every time I talk about my dreams, the response I get is always some version of the same idea:

“Why don’t you just get a normal job? Go out on weekends, have drinks with friends, take a summer trip to the nearest beach, and every now and then, buy yourself some new gadget so you can finally stop writing all that weird code on your PC. That’s it.”

NO. Absolutely not.

Wait, hold on. I know what you might be thinking. “And what’s wrong with that?” Or maybe, “Who are you, some rich kid who can afford to dream big?”

Sorry to disappoint you, but no. There’s no big bank account waiting for me. And no, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that kind of life. In fact, many of the people I know live exactly like that, and they’re probably happy.

But not me.

I want more. I want to push beyond the average. To do more, to achieve more. And yes, I get it, taking risks, pushing boundaries, trying to go beyond what’s safe can be a crazy thing to do.

1iigodf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1iigodf/breville_bdc450bss_precision_brewer_thermal/,Breville BDC450BSS Precision Brewer Thermal review: Is it the ultimate coffee maker for enthusiasts?,"As a self-proclaimed coffee aficionado, I’ve brewed countless cups using everything from an old-school French press to high-tech espresso machines. Enter the Breville BDC450BSS Precision Brewer Thermal. This sleek coffee maker had me intrigued with its promises of precision, versatility, and third-wave specialty coffee at home. Here’s my experience with it after several weeks of daily use.

**Design & Build Quality**

The Breville BDC450BSS Precision Brewer Thermal is a marvel of modern design. The brushed stainless steel finish gives it a premium, polished look that fits beautifully in any contemporary kitchen. It feels solid, and while there’s some plastic in the construction, it’s high-quality and durable. The dimensions are reasonably compact (9"" x 14"" x 16""), so it doesn’t dominate your countertop. Over time, the exterior has proven resistant to fingerprints, which is a bonus if you’re a neat freak like me.

Durability seems promising. The components, such as the thermal carafe and filter baskets, feel sturdy and well-engineered. However, the inclusion of plastic parts in some key areas like the water reservoir lid might raise questions about their longevity.

[Click here to see](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/breville-bdc450bss-coffee-maker-review-b078rqvqf1/) if Breville BDC450BSS Precision Brewer Thermal is on sale on Amazon.

**Brewing Performance**

One word: impressive. The Breville BDC450BSS lives up to its “Precision Brewer” name. With six different brewing modes—Gold, Fast, Strong, Iced, Cold Brew, and My Brew—it caters to every coffee mood. I tested them all.

The “Gold” mode, certified by the Specialty Coffee Association, adjusts water temperature and brew time to deliver a perfect cup every time. It’s my go-to setting for mornings when I need consistency. I was also blown away by the “Cold Brew” feature—it brews a rich, smooth concentrate in just a few hours. On the flip side, the “Fast” mode was a lifesaver for rushed mornings, whipping up a pot in record time without compromising flavor.

The machine features precise digital temperature control, a Thermo Coil Heating System, and adjustable flow rates. I felt like a barista dialing in the perfect brew. The Steep & Release technology was particularly handy for brewing smaller volumes, ensuring even extraction every time.

**Coffee Flavor**

If flavor is king, the Breville BDC450BSS wears the crown. I experimented with various beans, from cheap supermarket blends to single-origin roasts. The results were consistently rich and full-bodied, with no bitter aftertaste. The ability to tweak bloom time, temperature, and flow rate allowed me to tailor the flavor profile to my liking—floral and fruity for light roasts, earthy and robust for darker ones.

For iced coffee, the double-strength brew is perfect when poured over ice, while the cold brew mode creates a concentrate that’s smooth and never acidic. However, I found that the machine works best when paired with freshly ground beans. My older pre-ground coffee didn’t quite do it justice.

**Cleaning & Maintenance**

Cleaning this coffee maker is relatively straightforward. The thermal carafe doesn’t stain easily, and a quick rinse is usually enough. The machine comes with a water hardness test strip and a reminder system for descaling, which is a thoughtful touch. However, the non-removable water reservoir can be a bit tricky to clean thoroughly. I wish they had made it detachable.

**Pros**

1. Aesthetic design with a durable stainless steel finish.
2. Six brewing modes for ultimate versatility.
3. Excellent flavor, thanks to customizable brewing parameters.
4. Thermal carafe keeps coffee hot for hours without a hotplate.
5. Certified Gold mode for SCA-standard coffee.

**Cons**

1. Non-removable water reservoir makes cleaning a bit challenging.
2. The learning curve for first-time users due to numerous settings.
3. Some plastic components may not match the longevity of stainless steel.
4. Limited to 4 cups for iced or cold brew modes.
5. On the pricier side compared to basic coffee makers.

**Comparison to Competitors**

The Breville BDC450BSS competes with heavyweights like the Technivorm Moccamaster and the Bonavita Connoisseur. While the Moccamaster delivers a solid build and simplicity, it lacks the versatility of the Breville. The Bonavita, on the other hand, offers great performance at a lower price point but feels less premium and lacks features like Cold Brew mode.

Where the Breville shines is its ability to brew up to 60 ounces of coffee, compared to the Moccamaster’s 40 ounces. The programmable options and specialty modes also give it an edge over both competitors. However, if simplicity and durability are your priorities, the Moccamaster might be a better choice.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

Is it worth the investment? If you’re a coffee enthusiast who values precision, flavor, and versatility, absolutely. That said, the Breville BDC450BSS isn’t for everyone. If you’re content with basic drip coffee or don’t plan to use the advanced settings, you might not get your money’s worth. But if coffee is an essential part of your daily routine and you love experimenting with different brewing styles, this machine justifies its price.

**Features and Options**

The Breville BDC450BSS includes dual filter baskets, a thermal carafe, a cone filter basket insert, and a test strip for water hardness. It’s also compatible with pour-over adapters like the Hario V60. The programmable settings allow you to wake up to freshly brewed coffee, and the buttons and LCD interface are user-friendly once you get the hang of them.

Here’s my spiel. It’s sort of a rant, but it’s also a genuine question.

TLDR: husband says some sus things about handling our fussy baby and has slightly escalated annoyed behavior. What do I do about this? Therapy?

I’m not sure what to do. 
My husband and I just had our first baby. Husband was great before baby being born. I was taken care of and felt like we were doing okay as a couple. I usually do everything household chore wise, and I have for the last five years. But since being pregnant, he took on more household responsibility, but he doesn’t work or do anything really except get on discord and play games with friends… so it seemed fair. At the time I was working full time and going to school in person about 25 hours a week not including homework. I am studying to be a surgical technologist. I will be done with the program within a year.
Now, my baby is a month old. However this past month has been hell. One because of having our life turned upside down by our (awesome) new addition.
My husband used to be infantry in the Army and I just knew he’d have no issues staying up late or functioning under stress.
However I pegged him completely wrong.
As soon as we got home from the hospital you would’ve thought he was the one who gave birth. He slept for 12+ hours and complained how badly he hurt and was sore and didn’t touch the first dish or laundry pile or diaper. Which, everyone told me to let the house go and just focus on baby for the first couple of weeks while we get our bearings.
So I didn’t mind, but I did need help with handling a baby! I would ask, hey can you take him while I shower, etc. and he would take baby boy but just stand next to me while I did whatever task I wanted to do and as soon as it was complete he would be shoving our son back into my arms. I was in the shower and he stood outside of it with my screaming son.
I pull exclusively due to a horrible latch for the first week and my nipples were too torn up to try latching and now my baby is used to bottles. But every time I go to pump I swear my baby knows and pitches a fit so I’ve asked my husband to hold him while I pump. Only for 20 minutes. That’s all he has to do. Thats it.
So here’s the concerning part: 
Like all babies my son cries. He just got over some gassy spell which he would scream and cry during. My husband said while holding him the second week, “I can understand why people shake their babies.”This made me nervous as I do not feel that way I can’t even relate to it. (This is not a judgement to anyone else. I get it. I’m at the end of my rope as well, but I personally just haven’t felt that feeling).
Then the next day I requested a nap and for my husband to watch him for only 3 hours. I woke up with my bedroom door shut and my son’s room is across the house and his door was shut. I heard my son screaming and crying like I hadn’t heard before. I got out the bed super fast and ran for my son. My husband was just standing in the kitchen drinking coffee. I busted open my son’s room and he was red he was crying so hard. At only two weeks old.
I grabbed him and the second he touched me he stopped crying.
Another night last week, my son was on the floor with my husband doing tummy time and I was pumping and my son got really upset and starting crying and my husband leaned toward him and said, “that kind of cry is how you get punched in the face.” I looked at him really sharp and told him not to ever say that joking or not.
Then the last instance happened just yesterday. I was again pumping and all he had to do was hold the baby. I had been up with him all night and let my husband sleep in the bed unbothered all night. I got my husband up out of the bed and he immediately starting complaining that he’s exhausted. Never mind how long I’ve been up and hadn’t showered for.
I wanted to go off, but I simply said “okay just hold him for twenty minutes while I pump.”
He was so mad that he had to get up. Well Caleb starting crying of course and my husband laid back with him on the couch so they were stomach to stomach. Caleb kept crying instead of settling and I could tell my husband was agitated more and more. Then finally I wasn’t looking and I heard a real loud smack noise. I thought he hit my son so I got up super fast and grabbed my son, who was scared to death (he’s a month old as of yesterday) and starting crawling up my husbands chest away from him and got his face stuck down in a pillow within those three seconds it took for me to cross the room.
Well it turns out he didn’t smack him but he clapped his hands together super hard and angrily, like clasped them together loudly over my baby’s head.
My heart was racing and my adrenaline and fight or flight was activated 100%. I was so angry and sad and shocked and sick. The only thing my husband has said about it was, I didn’t hurt him. I refuse to talk to him. I’m so mad at him I feel like I hate him. But I don’t know what to do about this. I don’t know what his issue is… we’ve never been a perfect couple but I’ve never felt this way about him. My son is my whole world and beyond that he’s a helpless infant. I would die if anything happened to him.

What do I do? Therapy? Alone or together??
I’m scared to leave my baby with him.
