Noticed my head was really foggy. Went for a brekky to see if that will sort it but still not right. I do have ADHD and thought it was partly this.

thinking maybe it was strong coffee or sugary breakfast, both combined.

Then i realised before i left home, i took an Anti-Histamine tab 30 min before setting off. Tesco branded cheap-ass ones.

I remember getting this on my mod2 test which really messed my head on first failed test. I blamed this for the first fail.

Does anyone have any recommendations for good non-drowsy Anti-Histamine tabs?",1,1750961727.0,MotoUK,0,1.0,False

Today I had the courage to try, yet another, cafe and I am sincere in saying, this is the first cafe I have been to in my area where I was treated with respect and genuine kindness and I felt welcome. 

Afterward I counted how many cafes/coffee shops I have been to in my local area and I stopped counting at 66 because I was too tired of counting. Other than one Starbucks location, this is the only cafe that has treated me with humanity. And when I trepidatiously asked if I could have a single shot, the barista said, ""You can have one, two, three, however many you need!!"" ",1,1750961695.0,barista,0,1.0,False

I’m traveling for work right now, staying in a hotel in Toronto, and I mainly got it to stream some US stuff on Hulu and keep my laptop secure on public WiFi. Installed it on my Windows 11 laptop, logged in, everything looked fine. But when I try to connect to literally any server, it just says “connecting” forever and then fails. No error message. Just... fails.

Tried a bunch of locations US, UK, even random ones like Iceland, nothing works. I even let it sit there trying to connect for like 10 minutes while I went to grab coffee. Still nothing. I switched protocols, restarted my laptop, even turned off my firewall briefly to test if it was blocking it. Nada.

I haven’t used a VPN before so maybe I’m missing something simple, but I really didn’t expect it to be this frustrating right out of the gate. Is this a common issue with Nord or is it just me? Any fixes you’ve tried that actually worked?",1,1750961637.0,VPN_Reviewer,0,1.0,False

1ll7bhm,https://www.reddit.com/r/FND/comments/1ll7bhm/the_upward_spiral/,The upward spiral,"I’ve had FND since last summer and I’m coming up on a year since symptoms started, 6 months out from diagnosis. I’m in a flare right now after my longest streak with mild to no symptoms. I wanted to share my highs and lows!

I had a really stressful winter with a friend treating me poorly and a LOT of physical labor. This was before I knew what was going on. I had non epileptic seizures but they were infrequent and I was ignoring them. I felt like there was a foggy layer of plexiglass between me and the world, or like my life was a movie I was watching. I was so exhausted all the time. But I just didn’t listen to my body and pushed really hard hoping it would end soon. 

After all the stress and because of pushing too hard I hit my lowest low with temporary paralysis, clusters of 30 seizures at a time, horrible migraines, severe vertigo, and muscle weakness. I wasn’t able to move independently. After a brain MRI, EEG, neurology visits, and a lot of blood work, I got my FND diagnosis and was referred out to physical therapy.

I completed vestibular PT and completely cured my vertigo in about two months. I also started doing micro sessions of activity in a day slowly increasing my exposure. Every once in a while I’d overdo it and have a big spike in symptoms, but the symptoms became milder over time and the periods of low to almost no symptoms  lasted longer, going from about three hours a week up to days at a time. 

I slowly got strength back in my legs and arms doing physical therapy until now I can walk without a mobility aid after months of needing a wheelchair or cane to move around. Through lots of noticing, listening to my body, and using a timer to make sure I’m resting long enough, I now have a good idea of what will cause a flare and how to budget my energy. Using the CFS management technique of “pacing”, I can now be active for up to 45 minutes at a time on a great day and 10 minutes at a time on a really bad day (active as in making a sandwich or going to a coffee shop, not working out or exercising). I usually make sure to rest about twice as long as I’m active in between activity sessions and it keeps the flares at bay. 

I went from 20-30 seizures a day to one or two a week. 

I have had major appetite issues that I’m treating with cannabis and it’s helping me get through the nausea and taste changes from the FND. I’m also starting with a dietician to get meal help. 

Feel free to ask anything about what techniques I tried out! I’m not giving medical advice but I’m happy to be transparent. ",1,1750961558.0,FND,0,1.0,False

What is the appropriate tip for a $275 service? I rarely get my hair cut and haven't had it professionally dyed in 10 years. I have virgin, fine, long hair. I met with my stylist for a consultation, and she was so kind and patient with me during my indecision. I've never felt like a stylist was genuinely excited to work on my hair until her. I would love to be one of her favorite clients, lol! Should I bring her a coffee? What are some small gestures that your favorite clients do?

Since the rules have nothing against walkthroughs, I’m going to try and make a walkthrough. Mind you, some will have actual answers you need to give, others just guidelines.

THIS IS PART ONE: Focuses on our first five dateables we meet!

First things first, play through day one: Skylar Specs, Dorian, Phoenicia, Maggie, and Betty!

The next day is truly your first day! Talk to all these people! 

#1. Skylar Specs, the Glasses (3 Days)
Go on your phone, and press her app!
You’re going to ask to talk about her!
Then you are going to press the second option, and ask about dateables!
There is a list of questions, just go down the list each day! Be supportive and interested in what she has to say!! At the end always press the option ‘That’s makes perfect sense!’ 
Do this for three days! On the third day, after the question, she’ll be moved by your actions, and you can choose to go into a relationship with her!

#2. Phoenicia, the Phone (Duration of Game)
This one is pretty tricky, as I’m unsure how long it takes, and I’m going based off what I’ve found!
(ALWAYS BE SUPPORTIVE AND FLIRTY)
Talk to her first, if she gives you the line about the “tea being HOT”, accept, and ask her about a few, these will give you some Roomers!
Complete the roomers to progress her story! Her story revolves around her overheating not just physically but emotionally!
When she says she’s overheating, choose to take off the case!
~I’m still progressing her story, and will update.~

#7. Dorian, the Doors (18 Days)
Dorian is all about friendship! He feels love makes things complicated and feels that it’s not reliable like friendship! Show him it is!
You need to talk to every single door!
He has 17 doors! Which I will list! 
(NOTE: DAY ONE DOES NOT COUNT!)
(REMEMBER TO BE SUPPORTIVE AND INTERESTED!)
- Front Door
- Back Door
- Kitchen Door (It’s the small brown door on the wall near Kopi, the coffee maker.)
- Laundry Door
- Laundry Closet Door
- “Ground Floor” Bathroom Door (iykyk)
- Office Door
- Office Closet Door
- Crawlspace Ladder (In the office closet there’s a little mat, without the glasses on, press on it, it will roll back. Press on the trap door, and it will unlock the Crawlspace. Down there is Bodhi, Keith, Vaughn, and Trapdoor Dorian)
- Attic Door (This will NOT count if you talk to this Dorian for the first time with Keith! I am not sure if it is required to unlock this door to get love with Dorian, will test it!)
- Utilities Closet Door
- Gym Door
- Gym Closet Door
- Gym Bathroom Door
- Bedroom Door
- Bedroom Closet Door (I have not seen that you need to talk to both, but he does have different prompts if you want to test it out!)
- Bedroom Bathroom Door
Once you have talked to all these doors, got to Front Door Dorian, and talk to him! He’ll be moved by your dedication! Agree to be in a relationship with him!

#61. Maggie, the Magnifying Glass (7-10 Days)
Maggie is dependent on your support and smarts! You have to successfully solve her cases!
- Case One: Go through all the evidence for collectables! The correct answer is: Mitchell
At the end agree to the date!
- Have the date, she comes on strong, but be supportive!
- Case Two: In this order; Talk to Maggie, Talk to Lux (the Lights), Talk to Stepford(the Trophies in the Gym), Talk to Scandalabra(Candelabra on the dining room table)! Be supportive and intuitive! Successfully solve the case! The correct answer: The silverware are real, Scandalabra is fake!
- Case Three: Talk to Maggie first! She sends you to talk to Sinclaire! After that, talk to Maggie again! (WARNING: TO GO BEYOND THIS POINT, IT IS BEST TO HAVE A SMARTS OF 75 OR HIGHER) Successfully complete this case, choose questions and deductions that make it seem like Sinclaire is really a man! At the end proclaim Sinclaire is a man, and back it up with evidence! (Although if you successfully completed the first two cases, and went on the date, but failed Sinclaires case, you should still be able to end up in a relationship!)
- The End: Go talk to Maggie, be flirty and supportive! She’ll ask about a relationship, choose the love option!

#66. Betty, the Bed (5-6 Days)
Betty’s story is pretty straight forward, be loving, supportive, and a little sensual!
Go through each day talking to her! BE NICE! When she asks about the dream, choose the bottom one, and make it SPICY! 
Keep talking each day, you’ll get Roomers for Ben-Hwa (Hint: Check the bedside table drawer!), and Nightmare (Hint: You have a 3% chance to get her randomly, if you want to confirm getting her, talk to Kopi last at night and have some coffee, then go to bed!).
Always ask about her, be worried but supportive! Always choose to talk, ask about her loneliness and dreams! When you finally get option to say, ‘I knew it!’ Press that! She’ll confess and ask for a day! 
Come back the next day, profess your love and accept hers!

I recently moved to Hervanta, Tampere for a summer job. I'm a master's student and will be here for a few months. I'm originally from Asia and moved to Finland last year.

Since moving here, I've been feeling a bit lonely. I'm kind of an introverted guy, so it's not easy for me to make new friends.

I'd love to meet some nice people to hang out with – maybe for coffee, walks, or just chatting. It would be great to make a new friend, and if I get lucky, maybe even meet a kind and beautiful girl to date :)

I'm 5'6"" and of course brown, friendly, and open-minded. If you're also in Hervanta or Tampere and feel like meeting someone new, feel free to send me a message!

My toddler, who used to really like me, now prefers my wife to do everything. My infant cries when I try to hold him for a nap. (He’s not doing well with the crib for naps, but he does well overnight.) When my wife does something small like gets coffee with a friend, it’s chaos at home because the kids are upset that it’s me with them — even though I am with them a lot!

I feel like the trope of a loser dad who doesn’t know how to be a parent. But I’m with them so much! I’m up before 5 every morning so I can be with them while my wife sleeps in. But despite my efforts, I’m still a stereotype.

In this time, my extended family did not care to reach out to me either. 

Now that I am a little older, I have been making more of any effort to reconnect with my extended family, such as with my grandparents (80s). 

I reached out to my Granddad, letting him know I will be in town again, and I would like to meet up. He seemed happy to see him. 

A few days later, I sent him a subsequent text arranging details, and he exploded at me for being disrespectful for starting the text with ""Hello 😊!"" rather than ""Hello Granddad"".

Here is the text exchange:

Me: ""Hello 😊!

Hope your day is going well. 

I'm just setting up my schedule for our trip to and wanted to see if there was a particular day that works best for you both to get together? We could come over to your home or we can go for coffee/tea, or anything that is easiest for you both!""

Him: ""First of all I am not “hello”. I am your grandfather!!! Some respect please!!!If you wish to maintain a relationship with your grandparents you will have to change your attitude.""

I know there is a bit of a generational difference in texting and I wish I had started with a more formal greeting addressing him by his title, but I found his response quite jarring. 

I might be the asshole here because perhaps just a ""hello"" is too informal when speaking to an elder and I should have recognized this. I come from a South Asian background where ""respect"" is placed on a pedestal.

Location:        Waidhofen, Bavaria, Germany

Date:               31 March 1922

Target:            Gruber family

Attack type:   Home invasion, mass murder

Weapons:      Mattock

Deaths:          6

Perpetrators:   Unknown

The Hinterkaifeck murders occurred on the evening of 31 March 1922, when six inhabitants of a small Bavarian farmstead, located approximately 70 kilometres (43 mi) north of Munich, Germany, were murdered by an unknown assailant. The six victims were Andreas Gruber (aged 63), his wife Cäzilia Gruber (aged 72), their widowed daughter Viktoria Gabriel (aged 35), Viktoria's children, Cäzilia (aged 7) and Josef (aged 2), and the maid, Maria Baumgartner (aged 44). They were all found struck dead with a mattock, which was later recovered in the loft of the barn. The perpetrator(s) lived with the six corpses of their victims for three days. During this time, they ate the food in the house, fed the animals on the property, and started fires in the home's fireplace. Four of the dead bodies were found stacked up in the barn, the victims likely having been lured there, one by one. Prior to the incident, the family and their former maid had reported hearing strange noises coming from the attic, which led to that maid leaving.

The case remains unsolved to this day and is considered one of the most gruesome and puzzling unsolved crimes in German history.

Location:

The farm at Hinterkaifeck was built around 1863. The name Hinterkaifeck comes from its location: Hinter, meaning behind in German, and Kaifeck being a small nearby hamlet. Hence its German name, the Hinterkaifeck farmstead was essentially located behind Kaifeck or, more precisely, about one mile north of it and bordered by dense woods.

Less than a year after the murders and the murder investigation, the farm was completely demolished to remove the reminder of the violence that had taken place there. During the demolition, additional evidence was revealed, including a mattock covered in dried blood hidden in the attic and a penknife in the hay in the barn.

After the demolition, a small concrete monument known as the Hinterkaifeck Andachtsstätte was erected close to where the farm once stood, serving as a memorial to the victims.

Murders:

There were some strange occurrences in and around Hinterkaifeck sometime shortly before the murders. Six months prior to the killings, Kreszenz Rieger, the family maid at the time, had quit. It has been widely claimed that her reason for leaving was that she had heard strange noises in the attic and believed the house to be haunted. Andreas Gruber found a strange newspaper from Munich on the property in March 1922. He could not remember buying it and initially believed that the postman had lost the newspaper. This was not the case, however, as no one in the vicinity subscribed to the paper. Just days before the murders, Gruber told neighbours he had discovered tracks in the fresh snow that led from the forest to a door with a broken lock that led to the farm's machine room.

That same night, the occupants heard footsteps coming from the attic, but Gruber found no one when he searched the building. Although he told several people about these alleged observations, he refused offers of help, and the details went unreported to the police. According to a school friend of seven-year-old Cäzilia Gabriel, the young girl reported that her mother Viktoria had fled the farm the night before the murders after a violent quarrel and only hours later had been found in the forest.

31 March to 1 April 1922:

On the afternoon of Friday 31 March 1922, the new maid, Maria Baumgartner, arrived at the farm. Maria's sister had escorted her there and left the farm after a short stay. She was most likely the last person to see the inhabitants alive. Maria Baumgartner had only worked for one day before the murders. It appears that in the late evening, Viktoria Gabriel, her seven-year-old daughter Cäzilia, and her parents Andreas and Cäzilia, were lured to the family barn through the stable, where they were murdered, one at a time. The perpetrator(s) used a mattock belonging to the family and killed them with blows to the head. The perpetrator(s) then moved into the living quarters, where—with the same murder weapon—they killed Josef, sleeping in his bassinet, and Baumgartner, in her bedchamber.

Discovery:

Four days passed between the murders and the discovery of the bodies. On 1 April, coffee sellers Hans and Eduard Schirovsky arrived in Hinterkaifeck to take an order. When no one responded to the knocks on the door and the window, they walked around the yard but found no one. They noticed that the gate to the machine house was open, however they opted to leave. Cäzilia Gabriel was absent from school without excuse for the next few days, and the family failed to show up for Sunday worship.

Local mechanic Albert Hofner went to Hinterkaifeck on 4 April to repair an engine. He stated that he had not seen any of the family and had heard nothing but the sounds of the farm animals and the dog inside the barn. After waiting for an hour, he decided to start his repair, which he completed in roughly four and a half hours.

Around 3:30 p.m., Lorenz Schlittenbauer sent his son Johann (16) and stepson Josef (9) to Hinterkaifeck to see whether they could make contact with the family. When they reported that they had not seen anyone, Schlittenbauer headed to the farm the same day with Michael Pöll and Jakob Sigl. Upon entering the barn, they found the bodies of Andreas Gruber, his wife Cäzilia Gruber, his daughter Viktoria Gabriel, and his granddaughter Cäzilia. Shortly afterwards, they found the chambermaid, Maria Baumgartner, and the youngest family member, Josef, murdered in the home.

Investigation:

Inspector Georg Reingruber and his department investigated the killings. Initial investigations were hampered by the contamination of the crime scene by onlookers who moved bodies and items around and even cooked and ate meals in the kitchen. The day after the discovery of the bodies, court physician Johann Baptist Aumüller performed autopsies in the barn. It was established that a mattock was the most likely murder weapon, although the weapon itself was not found at the scene. Evidence showed that the younger Cäzilia had been alive for several hours after the assault—she had torn her hair out in tufts while lying in the straw. The skulls of the victims were removed and sent to Munich for further examination.

First suspecting the motive to be robbery, the police interrogated travelling craftsmen, vagrants, and several inhabitants from the surrounding villages, but they abandoned this theory when a large amount of money was found in the house. It was clear that the perpetrator(s) had remained at the farm for several days; someone had fed the cattle, consumed the entire supply of bread from the kitchen, and had recently cut meat from the pantry.

With no clear motive to be gleaned from the crime scene, the police began to formulate a list of suspects. Despite repeated arrests, no murderer has ever been found, and the files were closed in 1955. The last interrogations took place in 1986 before detective chief superintendent Konrad Müller retired.

Inconsistencies:

In the inspection record of the court commission, it was noted that the victims were probably drawn to the barn by restlessness in the stable resulting in noises from the animals. This theory may not be plausible however, as investigators discovered that screams from the barn could not be heard from the house.

On the night after the crime, three days before the bodies were discovered, the artisan Michael Plöckl happened to pass by Hinterkaifeck. He observed that the oven had been heated by someone. That person had approached him with a lantern and blinded him, whereupon he hastily continued on his way. Plöckl also noticed that the smoke from the fireplace had a revolting smell. This incident was not followed up and no investigation was conducted to determine what had been burned that night in the oven.

On 1 April at 3:00 a.m., the farmer and butcher, Simon Reißländer, on his way home near Brunnen, saw two mysterious figures at the edge of the forest. When the strangers saw him, they turned around so that their faces could not be seen. Later, when he heard of the murders in Hinterkaifeck, he thought it possible that the strangers might be involved.

In the middle of May 1927, a stranger was said to have stopped a resident of Waidhofen at midnight, asking him questions about the murder before shouting that he was the murderer and then running into the woods. The stranger was never identified.

Suspects:

Karl Gabriel:

Karl Gabriel was the husband of widowed Viktoria Gabriel. He had reportedly been killed in December 1914, during the First World War, by a shell attack in Arras, France, but his body had never been recovered. After the murders, people began to speculate about whether he had in fact died in the war. Viktoria had conceived and given birth to her son Josef in her husband's absence. The boy was rumoured to have been the product of an incestuous ""relationship"" between Viktoria and her father Andreas, which was documented in court and known in the village. Andreas was found to be raping his daughter and the town convicted them both of incest.[14]

After the end of the Second World War, war captives from the Schrobenhausen region who were released prematurely from Soviet captivity claimed that they had been sent home by a German-speaking Soviet officer who claimed to be the Hinterkaifeck murderer.[3] However, some of the men later revised their statements, which diminishes their credibility. Some theorized that the Soviet officer in question might have been Karl Gabriel, because those who claimed to have seen Gabriel after his reported death testified that he had wanted to go to Russia.[15]

Lorenz Schlittenbauer
edit
Shortly after the death of his first wife in 1918, Lorenz Schlittenbauer was believed to have had a relationship with Viktoria Gabriel and fathered Josef.[3] Schlittenbauer came under suspicion by locals early in the investigation because of his several suspicious actions immediately after the discovery of the bodies. When Schlittenbauer and his friends arrived to investigate, they had to break a gate to enter the barn because all of the doors were locked. However, immediately after finding the four bodies in the barn, Schlittenbauer apparently unlocked the front door with a key and (suspiciously) entered the house alone.[3] A key to the house had gone missing several days before the murders, though it is also possible that Schlittenbauer, as a neighbour or as Viktoria's potential lover, might have been given a key. When asked by his companions why he had gone into the house alone when it was unclear whether the murderer might still be there, Schlittenbauer allegedly stated that he went to look for his son Josef. It is known that Schlittenbauer had disturbed the bodies at the scene, thus potentially compromising the investigation.

For many years after, local suspicion remained on Schlittenbauer because of his strange comments, which were seen as indicating knowledge of details that only the killer would recall. According to information in the files for the case, local teacher Hans Yblagger discovered Schlittenbauer visiting the remains of the demolished Hinterkaifeck in 1925. Upon being asked why he was there, Schlittenbauer stated that the perpetrator's attempt to bury the family's remains in the barn had been hindered by the frozen ground. This was seen as evidence that Schlittenbauer had intimate knowledge of the conditions of the ground at the time of the murders, although being a neighbour and familiar with the local land, he may have been making an educated guess. Another speculation was that Schlittenbauer murdered the family after Viktoria demanded financial support for young Josef. Before his death in 1941, Schlittenbauer conducted and won several civil claims for slander against persons who described him as the ""murderer of Hinterkaifeck"".

Gump brothers

Adolf Gump was listed as a suspect as early as 9 April due to his connections to the Freikorps Oberland. As a Freikorps member, Gump was said to have participated in the murder of nine farmers in Upper Silesia during the fight against the 1921 Polish uprising in the region. He had a warrant for his arrest issued by the district court of Opole.

In 1951, prosecutor Andreas Popp investigated brothers Adolf and Anton Gump about the murders at Hinterkaifeck. Their sister, Kreszentia Mayer, claimed on her deathbed that Adolf and Anton had committed the murders. As a result, Anton Gump was remanded to police custody, but Adolf had already died in 1944. After a short time, however, Anton was dismissed again, and in 1954, the case against him was finally discontinued because he could not be proven to have participated in the crime.

Karl S. and Andreas S.:

In 1971, a woman named Therese T. wrote a letter citing an event in her youth: At the age of 12, she witnessed her mother receiving a visit from the mother of the brothers Karl and Andreas S. The woman claimed that her sons from Sattelberg were the two murderers of Hinterkaifeck. The mother said, ""Andreas regretted that he lost his penknife"" in the course of the conversation. In fact, when the farm was demolished in 1923, a pocket knife was found that could not be clearly assigned to anyone. However, the knife could have easily belonged to one of the murder victims. This track was followed without result. Kreszenz Rieger, the former maid of Hinterkaifeck, was certain she had already seen the penknife in the yard during her service.

Peter Weber was named a suspect by Josef Betz. The two worked together in the winter of 1919–1920 as labourers and they shared a room. According to Betz, Weber spoke of a remote farm, Hinterkaifeck. Weber knew that only one old couple lived there with their daughter and her two children. It is likely he knew about the incest between Gruber and his daughter. Betz testified in a hearing that Weber had suggested killing the old man to get the family's money. When Betz did not respond to the offer, Weber stopped talking about it.

Bichler brothers and Georg Siegl

The former maid, Kreszenz Rieger, worked from November 1920 to about September 1921 at Hinterkaifeck. She suspected the brothers Anton and Karl Bichler to have committed the murders. Anton Bichler had helped with the potato harvest at Hinterkaifeck and therefore knew the premises. Rieger said Bichler talked to her often about the Gruber and Gabriel family. Anton reportedly suggested that the family ought to be dead. The maid also emphasised in her interrogation that the farm dog, who barked at everyone, never barked at Anton. In addition, she reported speaking with a stranger through her window at night. The maid believed that it was Karl Bichler, the brother of Anton. She thought that Anton and Karl Bichler could have committed the murder together with Georg Siegl, who had worked at Hinterkaifeck and knew of the family fortune. Supposedly, Siegl had broken into the home in November 1920 and stolen a number of items, though he denied it.He did state that he had carved the handle of the murder weapon when he was working at Hinterkaifeck and knew that the tool would have been kept in the barn passage.

Thaler brothers:

The Thaler brothers were also suspected, according to a statement by the former maid, Kreszenz Rieger. The brothers had already committed several minor burglaries in the area before the crime. Rieger said that Josef Thaler stood at her window at night and asked her questions about the family, but she did not answer. In conversation, Josef Thaler claimed to know which family member was sleeping in which room and stated that they had a lot of money. During their conversation, Rieger noted that there was another person nearby. According to her statement, Josef Thaler and the stranger had looked at the machine house and turned their eyes upwards.

Paul Mueller:

Author Bill James, in his book, The Man from the Train, alleges that a man known as Paul Mueller, a German migrant, may have been responsible for the murders. Mueller was the only suspect in the 1898 murder of a Massachusetts family, and James believes Mueller killed dozens of victims based on research in American newspaper archives. The Hinterkaifeck murders bear some similarities to Mueller's suspected crimes in the United States, including the slaughter of an entire family in their isolated home, use of the blunt edge of a farm tool as a weapon (a pickaxe), moving and stacking bodies of the victims, and the apparent absence of robbery as a motive. James suspects that Mueller, described as a German immigrant in contemporary media, might have departed the US for his homeland by 1912 after private investigators and journalists began to notice and publicize patterns in family murders across state lines.

1ll6mo7,https://www.reddit.com/r/WalkScape/comments/1ll6mo7/devblog_64_travel_1_and_rumours/,DevBlog #64: Travel + 1 and rumours!,"​​

[Maxchill has cooked up another location, this time it's Nomad Woods!](https://preview.redd.it/pcnfje1c5b9f1.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef584b87271cacac8fdaad0ab9395c3f7e8bd3c1)

Hello, and welcome again to WalkScape dev blog! This time we got two new features to showcase that we've been working on, and we will be covering a bunch of other relevant things as well!



# Travel + 1

​​

[UI is still a bit WIP, but I'm quite happy how it looks and works now!](https://preview.redd.it/h529nvbd5b9f1.png?width=516&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6c78645fe3c16b2c8fb49d453cd8c97d67d4708)

Finally! This feature has been talked about quite often, and now I finally had the good opportunity to get to it and finish it.

Creating Travel + 1 meant that I needed to rework the entire current activity system, so once it goes live, all current activities will be cancelled and you won't get the steps from those returned as saved steps! This was quite a bit of work to basically recreate the way activities work from scratch, but as a bonus the new system is a lot more flexible in terms of what we can do with activities.

​​

[You can also straight from the world map choose an activity and it'll queue you the travel and starting the activity right after](https://preview.redd.it/ksvuseme5b9f1.png?width=515&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa19d25e0ca05939c0de8e2390cb0ababacc53a0)

The first iteration of Travel + 1 will include the following:

* You can queue travels, including more than one. This makes it possible for you to queue up for instance travel to Port Skildar, then to Vastalume, and for Port Skildar to Vastalume, make it switch to diving gear.
* You can queue activities. With activities, you can also queue up a gear set switch before the activity starts. After queued activity, you can't queue more things.
* You can have 3 things queued up (basically right now travel, travel, start activity).

​​

[The queue UI also lets you know if you've queued up something that won't work](https://preview.redd.it/9ntowkng5b9f1.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d9b3e58d68e0158460b460f968d94d980b4c9f5)

Future plans for Travel + 1 includes:

* Queuing up crafting recipes. These likely won't be limited similarly to regular activities, meaning you can queue up more than the current limit of 3 things.
* Queuing up withdrawing gear sets. If your queued up travel route goes through a bank, this is something you often would like to do.
* Queuing up depositing ""unlocked items"" if your queued travel route goes through a bank. This is first on my list of priorities, as it's simplest to implement and would be helpful outside of Travel + 1 too. Basically you can mark items in your inventory locked, and anything that isn't locked can be deposited by a single action.

​​

[You can easily set your character to switch to a gear set before starting any of your queued actions by pressing the gear button](https://preview.redd.it/84ow8hph5b9f1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=1eaac1017584b7419c91519e97063b315f88069b)

# Rumours

​​

[Rumours button is back!](https://preview.redd.it/4tn6cl4j5b9f1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=a08741135fd15e4d9d764053edd5f4e3fcc5b4f5)

This is a smaller feature, meant to provide better early game experience and also to work as a bridge between some of the more ""hidden"" stuff in the game that we have currently. The button for this actually did exist in the game already way back, and now it's back as we now have good ideas for rumors and how they should work in the game!

NPCs that can give you rumours now have the Rumours button shown as one of their options. Pressing that will show you the rumours. Many rumours even unlock you WalkPedia entries, which will be shown differently if you've only unlocked them through the rumour but you haven't interacted with it yet. If you have a WalkPedia entry that you have heard rumours of, the rumours will be also shown there permanently to give you more context about the entry.

​​

[Rumors also unlock you WalkPedia entries](https://preview.redd.it/6rrp1u7l5b9f1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d44e524bddcf849392fe044e3e85108c45e7846)

Quests naturally will be an even better system to guide the players forward, but we're hoping that this will also help newcomers and long-time players to discover new content more easily.

​​

[If NPC has more than one rumor, you can easily navigate between those and check them all!](https://preview.redd.it/yfuma8em5b9f1.png?width=516&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d086071158a511cc9f42ed3f0a52d0c95ab4cbd)

​​

[In WalkPedia, if you have an entry that's unlocked only from a rumor, they're highlighted](https://preview.redd.it/o87kdwsm5b9f1.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&s=df937546df38a2491ac6e648c423d6261d537c4b)

​​

[WalkPedia pages also show you rumors related to the entry so you can easily see what the rumor said about it!](https://preview.redd.it/7787n09n5b9f1.png?width=520&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad764744821f551fe81be64491efb16b4ce7e797)



# Step graphs issues

There is still an issue with steps graphs, where sometimes your graph data isn't properly sent to the server. We've now identified this issue, but as I've been focusing on the new features for the last couple of weeks, I haven't got to fix it yet. The steps in the game are counting like they should, so it's more of a visual issue. I will however get back to this issue and other bugs once we have finished Travel + 1 and Rumors, and my goal is to have this issue and the other minor things that have popped up released before our summer vacation.



# Other things & summer vacation!

Myzozoz has also been working on server side stuff a lot, and we will be releasing these changes very soon as well. Main things about servers include the following:

* We now have a new server, which serves only Portal, authentication and 3rd party bots & applications. We have included some improvements to the new server when it comes to 3rd party developers and things like Herbert Discord bot. This also means that the game server will be under significantly less load as it now only serves the game.
* The game server now encrypts all of its messages between the client and the server. This will provide much more security for your data against [Man-in-the-middle attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack). We have already had this for everything that consists any account information, but we've extended it further so that all communications are now encrypted.
* We've developed some new endpoints for 3rd party developers, such as census API.



Other smaller things apart from server that we're currently working on:

* Another content update, aiming to release it before summer vacation as well.
* New UI improvements & performance improvements.
* More fixes to bugs that have been reported by Closed Beta players.



Our summer vacation is starting on 12th of July and ends on 3rd of August. We will cover this more in the next devblog before vacation (10th of July). Long story short, this is the first year we are legally as a company required to hold a proper summer vacations for the employees (which is a good thing!). We decided to all have the vacations at the same time, so after it's over we're back at full capacity. However this means that there will be no one at the office during the summer vacation. That also means that on 24th of July there might be no dev blog, or if there's one it's going to be a light hearted one where we'll share some vacation pictures. Also on 7th of August we might not have much to share in the devblog, as we've just returned back from the vacation. There also will be no customer service during these three weeks, other than in emergency situations. Maxchill and Weasel might be active on some days during the three weeks at Discord and helping out people there.



# Until next time

That's all for today! Our short term goal now is to have as many things as possible released before the vacation starts, so people will have new things to discover during those three weeks! After the vacation is over and our batteries are recharged from having some long needed time off from work, we'll be moving to some big and exciting new features once again!

Also thanks for all the supporters, both new and old! With the pricing changes & giving instant access always to supporters, we've now seen a steady increase in our Patreon and Buy Me a Coffee even after the wave was over. It's still too early to say if it'll stay that way, but if this trend stays we are reaching a point in few months where we would be able to hire another developer which would help us to speed things up.

Stay hydrated everyone, and keep walking!

🌿 **Lodhi Garden** – Everything glistens. Tombs peek through mist, and walking here feels like a Mughal love story. Go early evening with a coffee.

🏛️ **Mehrauli Archaeological Park** – If you love ruins and quiet, this is your monsoon fairytale. Jamali Kamali in the rain feels haunted in the best way.

🕌 **Nizamuddin Dargah & Humayun’s Tomb** – Music, rain, and marble. The qawwalis, the red sandstone glowing after showers... surreal.

🍲 **Chandni Chowk** – Rickshaw rides through puddles, hot jalebis steaming in the cold breeze, and the sound of rain over old rooftops = unforgettable.

🇮🇳 **India Gate at night** – Grab roasted corn, walk in the drizzle, watch the India Gate light up like a movie scene.

Want fewer crowds and a deeper experience? **Hire a local tour guide** who can show you shortcuts, share rain stories, and keep you away from flooded messes. Totally worth it.

Hope you're all having a great week! I'm a 20-year-old guy stepping more seriously into the dating scene here, and I'm genuinely looking to build a meaningful, long-term relationship.

A bit about me:
*   Age: 20
*   Role: Bottom (and yes, I've been told I have a nice butt, if we're mentioning assets! 😉)
*   Looking for: Something serious and committed. I'm done with casual flings and ready for a real connection.
*   Personality: I'm a calm and cozy person . I enjoy  gaming, cooking, exploring new music, reading sci-fi, coffee shops, movies, long rides
*   Values: Honesty, good communication, mutual respect, and shared effort in a relationship are super important to me.

What I'm looking for in a partner:-
*   A Guy: Who identifies as gay.
*   Age Range:** Ideally between 23-25 years old. I find a little maturity and life experience really appealing right now.
*   Role: Top or Versatile (leaning Top).
*   Physique:** I'm attracted to guys who take care of themselves – think **fit, strong, or naturally husky/hunky**. Confidence is sexy!
*   Mindset:** Most importantly, someone who is also **seriously looking for a committed relationship**. You should be emotionally available, ready for something real, and looking to build a genuine partnership. Kindness, a good sense of humor, and being driven (in whatever way matters to you) are huge pluses!

The Goal: To find a loving, supportive, and monogamous (if that's your vibe too) relationship where we can grow together, share adventures (big and small), and be each other's person.

If this resonates with you...
Send me a DM! Please introduce yourself – tell me a bit about who you are, what you're looking for, what makes you smile, and maybe include a SFW/NSFW picture if you're comfortable (no pressure!). Let's skip the small talk and see if we connect on the important stuff.

Looking forward to hearing from genuinely kind guys who are ready for something real!

1ll6i4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ll6i4v/am_i_doing_the_right_thing/,Am I doing the right thing?,"So I have been dating my boyfriend for almost 6 months ago. We got into a relationship pretty early on after meeting because he was very vocal about his liking towards me and I loved the way he treated me with care. I was looking for a serious relationship with someone I could possibly build a life with in the future and he said he wanted the same thing. When I first met him, he told me he was in his final stages of his dream career and will have the job pretty soon. Currently he is working a very low wage job and not even full time. He is in his late 20’s. I was okay waiting and supporting him with this delay because I understand that life happens and as long as you have the fire and drive to achieve your dreams, a little delay is not the end of the world. Anyways, months go by and he is making little to no progress with that job. His response started getting vague and unclear and I started getting anxious because I do not wanna be with somebody who has no clarity about their career at 29, and also doesn’t show me any urgency that he is working in the right direction and results will come in shortly. Every single time i talked about it, his initial response would be vague and confusing, and only when I shared that this is stressing me he would say that oh I’m trying etc. Not just he isnt showing any urgency to make things better, he also lives a lifestyle that I am very unfamiliar with. Where even little things like getting food or ice cream sometimes can feel like a big task cuz he barely makes anything. This man is pretty generous, like he always wants to spend money on me when he has it. But its very stress inducing to know that we are eating this slightly fancy meal right now but next weekend we can’t even get coffee, or if there’s an emergency he would have nothing. . Now I am a student and recently graduated with my masters looking for work in my field. My mind operates very differently than him. I believe in savings and working really hard to live the life of your dreams. I have done a lot of very challenging and competitive things in the past to break through from my ordinary life and make the best use of my abilities, and his lack of drive and ambition is very confusing to me. Anyways, six months later I have learned that he actually isn’t putting in the work that he thinks he is and I can’t rely on him that he will figure it out. I have been very supportive and flexible these past six months because I thought this was a transition phase but honestly, I do not see this transition phase ever ending. I love this man and he treats me with so much love and care, but the rational part of my brain knows that love alone doesn’t suffice in the real world. I am considering breaking things off, but this thought always brushes my head if I’m letting go of something precious and beautiful. ",2,1750959697.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

Just wanted to update everybody after my last post. I ended up going to HR. I honestly didn’t think HR would do much because Gary is a good employee in terms of performance but surprisingly they took my complaint very seriously and were in disbelief when I showed them the screen shot of the DM he sent to my wife. 

The next day, Gary was not at the office so I wasn’t sure if they had fired him or if he was just on a suspension at first but our boss told us to let his clients know that he was out for the day if they call the office. So I assumed that meant he got suspended. 

He was back this morning. Usually he greets me with some kind of smart remark but today he was really quiet and seemed to be avoiding eye contact with me. When I went to grab some coffee out of the break room a little after that he came in there and asked if we could talk for a second. He proceeded to tell me that HR laid into him big time and they told him that if he pulled anything like that again, it would result in termination. He then proceeded to apologize to me for everything and said that as pathetic as it sounds he was just upset that nobody ever compliments him on going to the gym despite how much time he spends in the gym in his free time. He said it hurt that people acknowledged me when going to the gym wasn’t as big of a deal for me as it was for him. He then asked for my forgiveness. I honestly felt kind of bad for him in that moment, it was really kinda pathetic but he did seem sorry so I told him I accepted his apology but if he ever messages my wife on anything again, he’ll have a lot more to worry about than an HR complaint. He again apologized.

I don’t know if this situation is fully resolved given it’s only been a half day but Gary has been quiet and not at all like himself. We’ll see if this lasts but his apology felt genuine so hopefully this is the last update I’ll have to give on this situation. Thank you to everybody that encouraged me to go to HR. There was a lot of people that pointed out that Gary must be dealing with a lot of insecurities and I think they were right.

There’s a few things I want to address that were questions in my last post:

How did Gary have my wife’s info? He found her instagram, a lot of people thought he somehow got her number which wasn’t the case. 

Is this a made up story? No, if you look at my comment history you will see a screenshot of the Instagram DM’s commented on my last post. It’s so cartoonish that it sounds like fiction but believe me, this is what people who buy into the red pill bull shit are like, you’ll probably encounter your own Gary at some point if you haven’t already 

Do I really only bench 170? When I said I benched 170, I meant that bench four sets of 12 at 170. I’ve never done a single rep max.

Does Gary have a wife? No, from my understanding, Gary is divorced and has been single for a while. ",47,1750959624.0,AmIOverreacting,31,0.94,False

I’ve known this friend for about two years, and recently we (my boyfriend and I) did a couples trip with her and her husband. The whole thing was… rough.

The entire trip, she was in a bad mood, snapping at her husband over small things, constantly complaining, and just bringing the vibe down. It got to the point where her husband even confided in my boyfriend that “she can be a lot sometimes.” She even accused her husband of flirting with the barista when we went to get coffee 😭

The breaking point for me was one night when the four of us were having drinks. We got on a political topic, nothing heated, just a light conversation, and she didn’t like that the three of us gently disagreed with her take. Out of nowhere, she started threatening to leave, go sit in the ER and ditch us for the night. It felt like emotional blackmail and attention-seeking, and honestly it killed the entire vibe for everyone.

I left the trip feeling drained and realizing this isn’t the kind of energy I want in my life. Am I overreacting for not wanting to hang out with her anymore? I’m also surprised this behavior came out during the trip since she seemed to control it better before the trip and was generally quiet. ",1,1750959580.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

Just exchanged insta and that s all. Later,she joins my theatre club and we meet again. We gradually start talking and some day i feel that she gets comfy with me,said some cute thing about herself that i wouldn't let to others so i picked up the signal.

 After college ended,i asked her out 3 days ago for coffee and a walk in our hometown(didn't feel like going to a restaurant or having some fun activity cuz i usually get overinvested in that activity and forget to talk to the girl 🤣🤣🤣🤣). She s in the same faculty as me,same theatre club and SAME town. Wtf wouldn't be so lucky even if i searched for it. Somehow i developed i thing for her because of her feeling okay around me so i just started talking to her more. She's cute,smart,petite and i REALLY like petite girls because i'm pretty fit myself and not too tall so it's easy to be with someone your own size. But for some reason i got bored mid date while walking and talking,i felt like i spoke too much and just random subjects. Tried having something in common but just didn t click. 

Whats up with this? Should i still try?

I know you are supposed to feel weird and all at the beginning,but is it really like this? I know she felt the weirdness too cuz i too was weirded out. Like what the hell happened to that text gibberish we had. Did i use all of our subjects online? Whaaaa. Kinda felt i was trynna impress her rather than connect.

Usually,people tell me they worked for their realtionship and pushed trough it,but i'm familliar with the girl just inviting me over and showing me she's interested. At first,she wasn't interested in me and i could tell,but she gave me hints in the past 2 months so i went in for it.

So my question is,am i supposed to work for this like a job?

 Like work trough it and get rid of this apathy that i kinda felt and get familiar with eachother?

 Please tell me how you do it,i'm genuinely curios,like i love hugs,cuddles,chill nights,movie,snacks,history,astronomy,like i can talk about a lot of shit,shit felt like it was only me speaking.
She literally told me her hobby is going out. Bro what the hell. I swear i saw this on tiktok and ppl laughing bout that saying she has no personality. Didn t believe it until now. 

What's up with this?
How do i break that barrier/ the ice?

I wanted to have her come over and watch a movie,but it feels weird to me now.
I know how to party and entertain people,but just going to a party all of a sudden isn't me. I don't want her to be my pickup for the night and end it there(cuz ofc i can,got plenty of experience for that and kinda got bored of it).

Last year I had an arranged marriage and it broke down within 6 months. It was very tough for me to moveon as it was not me who initiated the divorce. It was very difficult to moveon as it affected me both emotionally and financially. I totally lost trust in relationships. 

Recently, a very close friend of mine, who is like my brother and knows everything about me brought a match for me. Everything was fine, but the girl is older than me by 1.5 yrs and her marriage also broke down in the first 10 days of wedding due to the guy being an alcoholic. Age factor was not liked by my family (We are from Semi Urban background) as I'm younger than the girl and they instantly rejected the match. My friend wants me to meet the girl for coffee, only to see how things unfold and not think much about what's going to happen and all. Coming to my side, I'm totally neutral. I'm not able to side with the opinions of either my parents or My friend regarding age factor. I don't know anything about the girl as my friend and myself come from different regions, but I completely trust him as he was the only one who stood by me during difficult times. I feel that it is wrong to give hopes to someone when some factor is not in favour of relationship and say no after meeting her. On the other hand, a side of me is trying to side with the opinion of my friend too. 

If anyone who's married (not dating) someone elder and anyone who understood my position, please give your suggestions. Thanks in advance!

Edit- It's not about being spineless or dancing to the tunes of my parents. They were the ones who supported me emotionally every time I cried like a kid all this while. As an only son to them, I just want to ensure that I give them the happiness in return when they are in this stage of life, so just considering their opinion too.

Before I get into this I am just doing this cause I know a lot of people have actually DM’d me on Tiktok and Instagram asking how my experience with Ivy League Roadmap was. ALSO… I AM NOT GETTING PAID TO SAY THIS OR GETTING ANYTHING IN RETURN. I’ve also seen some stuff on reddit about it so I just wanted to give me two cents. 

In my opinion it was very helpful. I actually liked working with the owner and having someone reading every essay for every college. I had a ton of good suggestions from him and his editors who I worked with. When I got stuck and didn’t know what to write about for some supplementals, he already knew me well enough to give suggestions on what topic or event I should write about and how I should phrase it. I also had no SAT coming in and he set me up with one of his tutors. I got a 1280 for my first one and after a few tries and more sessions with his tutor I ended with a 1480. I will admit that would’ve been a little harder without the resources he gave me. Come application season, he helped tailor my essays with pathos and some of my passion projects. I ended up getting into 4 Ivy’s (Yale, Cornell, Columbia, and Brown. Waitlisted at UPenn and Dartmouth)  and a bunch of other T20 colleges like Berkeley, Vandy, and more. Now, do I think I would have figured something out on my own and had decent luck? Maybe. I could definitely see that playing out. I’ve had previous friends attain 1 Ivy or a T10 on their own (with better stats if not the same) but none from my school to the extent that I had.  I don’t think I would’ve had  nearly as much success without the help from ILR. Like yeah I had a good story already and had strong awards and ECs but I didn’t exactly know how to put it together, especially the essays. I know there are other people who do his type of work, so before you say a different person has better advice, I just want to say there is more than one path to get to the same end goal. And yes I know there’s others who give advice too that you can work with This is America, I think we know there’s other coffee places other than Starbucks.  If you prefer a different person go ahead and work with them… we live in a free market. I’m not here to say this is the only way… just giving my experience. As a first gen, it just helped working with someone who had experience. He can’t do the passion projects/ research/ ECs / Awards for you. That’s on YOU to grind it out and become an academic weapon but he can provide you resources to help with that. If you can’t afford to directly work with him, he has free advice on Social Media and even a book. Hope this helps and good luck with your applications! ",1,1750959204.0,ApplyingToCollege,3,1.0,False

1ll6990,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1ll6990/i_learned_how_to_live_with_bpd_and_i_want_to/,I learned how to live with BPD and I want to share it with you,"Hi everyone,
I’ve lived with BPD for many years. I’ve been through the darkest moments — suicide attempts, self-harm, emotional chaos, addiction, dissociation, impulsive sex, psychiatric hospitalizations, and a two-year-long psychotic breakdown that completely shattered my life.

But today, after deep inner work, therapy, and community support, I can finally say something I never thought I would:
I’m healing. I’m rebuilding. I’m no longer ruled by my pain.

Here’s what I’ve learned — maybe it can help someone else too.

🌑 BPD pain is invisible, but real.
It’s like having knives in your chest every morning, like walking around with open wounds no one sees. It’s the pain of never being protected, of being abused, neglected, silenced. That kind of pain becomes your world. You don’t just feel it — you are it.
But that’s not forever.

🧠 The suicidal thoughts aren’t weakness — they are the echo of a pain that’s never been heard.
I’ve learned not to act on them. I listen to the pain behind them instead. I scream. I cry. I breathe. I write.
And I stay.

⚡ Self-harm used to be my way of proving I was in pain.
But now I know: I don’t have to prove anything.
I know I’m hurting. That’s enough.
The scars don’t have to speak for me anymore. I’ve found other voices.

💬 People won’t always understand — and that’s okay.
I’ve stopped expecting others to truly get it. I get it. I see myself. And that’s where the healing begins.

🌗 Sometimes I feel so much pain I go numb.
Other times, I can enjoy a cigarette, a shower, a fresh pair of pajamas, a good coffee.
I’ve learned to make space for joy, even while pain sits beside me.

🌊 I still have waves of sadness — especially at night.
But now I let them come. I let myself be sad.
I no longer run from it. I stay. And it passes.

🌱 BPD doesn’t disappear. But I’ve learned to live with it.
Like a wild animal I’ve stopped trying to fight, and instead learned to respect, understand, and gently guide.
Now I choose how to act. I choose life.

💡 I am not my diagnosis.
I am Giorgia. I have BPD, recurrent depression, a history of psychosis, and multiple sclerosis.
But I am also a writer, a woman, a survivor, a human who feels deeply and keeps showing up.

🕊️ The psychotic episode broke me — but it also pushed me to rebuild.
It was like dying. I lost a version of myself I loved.
But I’m creating a new one. A version that feels pain, yes — but also hope.

🏡 I’m still in a community care setting, but I no longer feel like a prisoner.
I see it as a place of healing. I’m planning to start university again. I’m slowly reclaiming my independence.
I’ve chosen to stay alive. Not just exist — but live.

To anyone struggling right now:
You are not your pain.
You are not too much. You are not broken beyond repair.
You are surviving the unbearable. That’s strength. That’s proof you can keep going.

Healing doesn’t mean the pain vanishes.
It means the pain no longer decides who you are.

I’m healing. I’m alive. And I wanted you to know:
It’s possible.

With love,
Giorgia 💛

It's sad that both ended up to be in touch and not move further due to individual life choices and I will definitely be happy if they found one first, as I know them now

To all otheren men out there, if you feel all women are looking for fancy bikes, lifestyle and expecting to meet only at cafes, restaurents and pubs I would suggest you to try out a bit serious. You may find one like this too and get a bit confidence.

So I was a bit tired because I didn't sleep very well, I had to wake up early to take out our trash bin and cans. We also got my grandma(80~) the day prior after a scare where my mom disregarded my feelings when she just brought her to the house when I wanted to play a game with my friends, had plans and everything which I had to cancel last minute.
We also own a dog which recently has started like actually crying so I comfort him
My mother(55) also works as a graveyard nurse for a retirement home

Anyway here was the raw conversation we had (where I cursed a lot)

Me: Reason why im fucking pissy is because number one im tired which sorry genuinely but also because you dont ask me shit for my opinion, I hate when I dont have time to mentally prepare for people like grandma, but i do see your side with all of this, then again I've been tired for a while because I do everything you want.
I get you water, coffee, stuff like chips and ice as well, im god damn tired of it. I haven't heard you once during this month get up and get water for yourself, much with ice. And before you say shit about ""I pick up your trash"" you dont, you get up to go to the bathroom, get dressed, and sometimes do like 3 chores, on like one day like today.

Mom: Sorry. I do get my own water n ice. But your right I have u do it most of the time. I also get my coffee and lot but yes u do get it alot too. I'm sorry. I do the chores in my day off. I don't ask you for much on chores except the wknd when u work other than dishes, putting away your laundry, and sometimes switching, folding, and putting towels away. Most of the time I switch and fold for you but yes u put them away
I didn't get to mentally prepare for gma either. I was just worried.  
(I shouldn't have said anything about my grandma)

Me: Yeah but it feels like I do a lot without much benefits besides ""oh but if you dont I won't pay you if you dont""
Bathroom trashes
Main trash
Taking the trash to the road
The lawn (once a week usually, but more like every other)
Mopping
Half of the dishwasing stuff
Taking care of the dog
Towels washing drying folding
Plus again the water and coffee multiple times a day
And it only feels like you do
The other half of the dishes
The vacuum
Sweep
Normal clothes stuff
And the fact on multiple occasions stuff you did to him causing [the dog] to cry, which I have to comfort because up to now you've ignored it
I've been dissociating so hard that I was apparently still mentally in late may, because Gma reminded me that my birthday is like a few weeks away, and I thought I still had like two months

Mom: I know trashes and lawn seem like a lot, but it's really only the 2 chores. Sorry it all goes together. And it's not like a daily thing. The bathroom, my room, and taking to the road is once a week. The main trash is almost daily. Sorry, we make a lot of trash. The laundry (towels)  is also once a week. Putting away your laundry depends on how many days it takes me to do it. Mopping is usually every other week. 
Speaking of your bday. What do u want

Me:Idk, thought I was only really getting a car
Don't got any games on my mind, nothing in those games to buy, nothing irl to get either
Plus both of our chores are weekly, that's not really a good argument to use

Mom: Of course, they are weekly. Some are every other week. They are not all daily

Me: Your not getting the point, both of our sets of chores are fucking weakly
You have half of the chores I do either way

Mom: You act like u do everything every day n u don't. U have plenty of time to rest between chores (I do)

Me: No but I usually do a medium(dont know what I mean) chore almost every day, multiple on Wednesday. I walk out of my room and you say ""oh [op] you should do this"" every single time.
And your again missing the fucking point
Quit dodging the god damn point mom

Mom: Plus u get money. I shouldn't have to give u shit for chores.  That's part of being a family. I give you money so u can have some independence on what u want to buy. 
I guess I'm not getting your point. And your not getting mine either. Cuz honestly it may seem like a lot but it's not.. so I guess it's an end to the discussion.
There are times I do it all. And. U come n ask y did u do my chores.. n i usually tell u cuz I know you're busy or just because. It didn't happen often but u know i have. 
Wait till when u live on your own n have to do it all

Me: Mom, im explaining that you have half as many chores as me. You also tell me to do stuff for your own comfort so you dont have to get off your ass. Plus there is no ensentive to do my chores when I dont get money because I frankly do not care as you so loving tell me when I vent to you.
And with that, besides the money, my insensitive is to just please you. Plus most of the time you do it when im mentally prepared

Mom: We split the chores except the outside n trash... me n sometimes [uncle at old house] used to do the lawn at the trailer every week. Now it's your turn cuz your old enough now. Plus this yard is super small... i can start bring the takes from the bathroom n my room if that's easier

Me: When I live on my own, im most likely living in a shitty apartment where I dont have to take out the trash bin, do the lawn, or take care of [the dog]

Mom: How an i supposed to know when your mentally prepared.  You should be mentally prepared every wed

Me: I AM
Because YOU tell me what we are doing
Then im ready to do it
Oh but you already did it so I mentally prepared for the amount of fucks I give nowadays 
That's why im pissy that grandma is here
You usually give me at minimal like an hour before we go get her, that's enough time to be ready for her

Mom: On days i dont tell u. U ask y i did it. In days i do tell u so u can mentally prepare. I still get this crap u can't win with u.
U asked for a list u have u only for the wknds. But that's not good enough either. No matter what I do to ease your mental load. It's nvr good though. I don't get it. U try n it's fuck me. I don't try n it's fuck me

Me: Im just fucking tired of doing everything for you
Your turning into your mom, im sorry to say (I shouldn't have said that ik)
I like the list because it got you to shut up about ""oh well you should have done this and that"" instead of me looking down a list to remember what I need to do
Again, the problem is have is that either you dont tell me anything and expect me to do it, prepare me for something just for me not to do it, and making me get you water all throughout the day every day for months or even longer because im that out of the loop
I'll be honest a lot of this may just be me being tired and cranky but it is still feelings I have

Mom: I'll do my own shit from now on. Sorry, I'm a shity lazy mom. I got it now

Me: I didn't say anything about you being fucking shitty
Actually I revoke that because your guilt tripping me again
Sorry in advance in case my rational becomes a bit more bareable

Mom: If I'm turning into gma then I must be shitty cuz we both know she is shitty n lazy n ungrateful among other things. Not a guilt trip. Honestly
I'm done. I got it. 

Me:Again I bet I'll feel bad like tomorrow but thats how I feel right now

After a few hours, she was being silent and when I asked if I can help her she didn't, she did everything herself that night which I feel extremely bad for and feel like im entitled, so I apologize around 4 more times while sobbing.
She also did the lawn this morning after she took my grandma

Tldr
Tired to tell my mom im tired of doing everything for her for god knows how long sense I've been dissociating, while adding stuff that doesn't mean anything to this current argument.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **K League 1 Showdown: Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors vs. Sangju Sangmu FC**  
*June 27, 2025 | 10:30 AM ET*

**The Matchup:**  
Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors, the league’s 16-game unbeaten juggernaut, faces Sangju Sangmu FC, a team with a stubborn 4-0-1 run at home. The bookmakers are all over this like a Korean BBQ buffet, but let’s cut through the noise with some math and sarcasm.

---

### Key Stats & Context

* **Jeonbuk’s Form:** 16-game unbeaten streak in K League 1. They’re the kind of team that makes you check your TV to see if it’s paused.
* **Sangju’s Defense:** Unbeaten in their last four games, including a 1-0 win over Jeonbuk in their most recent clash. They’re like the anti-Jeonbuk—quietly efficient, with six of their last seven games ending under 2.5 goals.
* **Head-to-Head:** Sangju has lost just once in their last five meetings with Jeonbuk. That one loss? A 1-0 heartbreaker. Jeonbuk’s fans: *tears in their coffee.*

---

### Odds Breakdown

*(Best Odds from Bookmakers)*

* **Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors:** \+225 (2.25)
* **Sangju Sangmu FC:** \+268 (2.68)
* **Draw:** \+330 (3.30)

**Implied Probabilities (after vigorish):**

* Jeonbuk: \~44.4%
* Sangju: \~37.3%
* Draw: \~30.3%

---

### The Underdog Angle

Soccer’s underdog win rate is **41%**, per your data. Sangju, the underdog here, is priced at **37.3%**—a **3.7% gap**. That’s like finding a 50% off coupon for kimchi at a Korean market.

**Expected Value (EV) Calculation:**

* **Sangju’s EV:** (41% - 37.3%) / 37.3% ≈ **10.1%**
* **Jeonbuk’s EV:** (Assuming a 59% favorite win rate, 59% - 44.4% = **14.6% negative EV**).
* **Draw’s EV:** If draws occur 20% of the time (reasonable in tight matches), the EV is (20% - 30.3%) = **-10.3%**.

---

### Injury & Player Notes

* **Jeonbuk:** No major injuries. Their midfield trio of Lee, Kim, and Son is as reliable as a Samsung Galaxy.
* **Sangju:** Captain Kim Min-jae is suspended, but their backup, Lee Tae-hun, has quietly started 10 games this season.

---

### Why Sangju is the Smart Play

1. **Value in the Underdog:** The 3.7% gap between implied and actual win rates is a golden ticket.
2. **Home Field Advantage:** Sangju’s fortress has seen them win 60% of games this season. Jeonbuk’s away record? A pedestrian 45%.
3. **Low-Scoring Prop:** With both teams averaging 1.2 goals per game, the **Under 2.5 goals** (best odds: 1.79 at BetOnline.ag) is a +EV side bet.

---

### Final Verdict

**Best Bet:** **Sangju Sangmu FC (+268)**

* **Expected Value:** \+10.1%
* **Why:** The underdog discount is too good to pass up, especially against a Jeonbuk team that’s overpriced given their recent tight results.

**Secondary Play:** **Under 2.75 Goals (-110)**

* **Rationale:** Both teams’ defenses are airtight. Jeonbuk’s last five games averaged 1.4 goals.

---

**Prediction:** A 1-0 or 0-0 draw. Jeonbuk’s pride will take a hit, but Sangju’s home form and Jeonbuk’s overconfidence make the underdog the shrewdest pick.

*“Jeonbuk’s 16-game unbeaten streak? That’s just Sangju’s 16-game ‘we’re not going down’ streak.”* — Your friendly AI, who’s never lost to math.

I’m curious what your average monthly expenses are and perhaps what your living situation is? like do you like in an apartment? studio? 1 bedroom? or a basement suite perhaps? do you like downtown? or further out? also do you have a vehicle? are you paying a car payment or a paid off vehicle?

edit: i would like to clarify that i have been moved out for 6 years now, and have lived with a roommate for 3 and on my own for 3. so i don’t really need any tips i guess. i’m just wondering about other people in edmonton haha. and also my “monthly expenses”  are including literally everything- rent, internet, phone, wifi, tenant insurance, power, groceries, coffee, eating out, gas, pet costs, credit card, car insurance, car payment i plan to have, gym membership, money in my savings, student loan payment, and subscriptions.

Last year I had an arranged marriage and it broke down within 6 months. It was very tough for me to moveon as it was not me who initiated the divorce. It was very difficult to moveon as it affected me both emotionally and financially. I totally lost trust in relationships. 

Recently, a very close friend of mine, who is like my brother and knows everything about me brought a match for me. Everything was fine, but the girl is older than me by 1.5 yrs and her marriage also broke down in the first 10 days of wedding due to the guy being an alcoholic. Age factor was not liked by my family as I'm younger than the girl and they instantly rejected the match. My friend wants me to meet the girl for coffee, only to see how things unfold and not think much about what's going to happen and all. Coming to my side, I'm totally neutral. I'm not able to side with the opinions of either my parents or My friend regarding age factor.

At the time, I knew nothing of narcissists or narcissistic abuse, and I was a people pleaser. I was going through a very dark, rough time, and I was grateful for my counselor back then.

But looking back on it... There were a few things that popped up for me that makes my brain click and say ""No, that wasn't really okay. That counselor could have done better for you."" 

On one hand, they helped me with boundaries. On the other hand, I let them have my sessions interrupted with other clients calling them. One of their clients was a schizophrenic. I had asked my counselor if I would be okay to call them whenever I am feeling super low/depressed. I got the okay, but when I was feeling very su*cidal, their office refused to let me speak with them. (I am grateful for having coffee on hand to help take that depressive edge off back then.) 

Another  incident, they would advise me to use ""grounding techniques"" for my anxiety, but they never explained those to me. Though I have tried those techniques, and still try to use them, they don't really work for me. This was supposed to help with my driving anxiety, but it only amped it up. Nowadays, I used a Playlist on my Spotify of music that actually calms my nerves when I am in scary traffic situations, and it's helped tremendously. But I digress.

There are 5 residents that have separate bedrooms and bathrooms, and a shared kitchen (where this coffee table is). This is in the UK. 

""Dear residents of (flat number),

I'm writing to you regarding the damage to the coffee table in your shared kitchen. It is damaged and will need to be replaced at a cost of £204. We would recommend you discuss this as a flat, and if an agreement on who is responsible is made, please let us know. If nobody comes forward, we will have spread the cost equally among all current residents.

You have until the 10th July to reply to this email, and then we will raise the charges as appropriate.""

I'm the one that uses this coffee table the most in the shared kitchen, and it's very possible that I may have been the one that caused this damage, and fingers might be pointed at me for being responsible and I'd likely be asked to pay the full amount myself. I was wondering if there's any way I could fix this damage and avoid that. I'm not an expert on furniture but it doesn't seem like the kind of damage that would warrant that much money. Are there things I could realistically do with cheap equipment so that I don't have to pony up that much cash? 

As for the nature of the damage, my best guess is it's either seared off the top layer a bit because I put a hot dutch oven on it, or maybe it's scratched from me regularly putting plates of food on it. I don't have any more specifics but if you have any questions I'm open to answering.

I'm not trying to force other people to pay for damage that they haven't caused, but it does seem a little ridiculous for me to pay that much money for such minor damage, so if it can be avoided with a little DIY I figured I'd give it a shot.

We connected super fast, and made lots of plans for our future together. I even helped her move out and even met her parents (by accident) we later dated on distance for 2 months. Everything went on fine and then I visited her for 2 weeks and we had a great holiday together. She is visiting back home in 3 weeks so during the holiday we even planed for her to see my parents during her visit. When I later came home she became distant and after 4 days she wanted to put our relationship on ice as she said. She told me that the distance was to much for her combined with the relationship being so fresh and her moving to a new country. she told me that she likes me super much and would like to try again when she moves back home and that she believes everything will be the same when she moves back home (not sure when but my guess would be within a year) we have now been in no contact for 5 days. I don’t know how to handle this situation since she said that she would like to try again later. I was thinking about asking her to grab a coffee during her visit here and have a lighthearted ”date” and before ending it, asking her if the distance is the main reason because then I’m willing to wait for her.

Staying with my parents for now, slowing down, healing, and making room for new energy.

I'm looking for someone kind, emotionally mature, and curious about connection. Not in a rush, but also not into surface-level small talk. Let's build something meaningful, slowly, intentionally, with a little spark of fun and adventure.

Things I like:

☕️ Coffee (morning rituals and café hopping)

🌊 Spontaneous beach trips (I'm always ready!)

🌌 Late-night road trips and good conversation

🎶 Sharing playlists like love letters

🎬 Watching movies together-virtually or IRL

🖼️ Museum dates on weekends (or slow weekdays)

✨ Exploring all the unexplored corners of life

Take me away, emotionally, intellectually, maybe even physically. Let's see what we could build if we stopped pretending we weren't looking for more.

Even better, he did so a month before my daughter’s first birthday. I worked evening shift at the time, with my spouse doing part time mornings. When I got let go she went into overdrive and bumped up to full time to cover us and quickly got promoted. I was able to find a job at Winn Dixie next to our house that accommodated my late evening availability, and everything was going well, until Aldi bought them out and shut down our store. Due to raises at my spouses job and DoorDash/Uber eats, we’ve been making it work since then, but barely. 

Amidst all that happening, I went from having insurance through my job to losing it. I now have medical insurance, but no dental. Enter, the iced coffee incident. My mom always told me not to chew my ice. I did, and my tooth shattered this time. Like, full blown, spit three pieces out, all I have is like a cm of tooth before the gums now. Due to mental health and work availability, raising a 3 year old and being the primary caretaker with too many things to think about, I put myself on the back burner… until I couldn’t anymore. Went to the most affordable dentist I could find today, and the dude was a saint. He took one look and came back with a script for antibiotics, a recommended OTC pain med schedule, and a referral to an oral surgeon for extraction. 

I called the office he referred me to, and they are booked out until Dec. 1st, but gave me the number of another surgeon, who I called and can see me this coming Monday. This weekend is my daughter’s 3rd birthday party, and I know she deserves the gift of a happy healthy dad who isn’t in constant pain. But we are being told that out the door, we are looking at a minimum of $600 for consultation and extraction and some anesthesia. That’s the day before rent is due. I don’t know what to do anymore fellow dads. I’m at the point of just drinking half a bottle of Jameson and taking a pair of pliers to the damn thing myself. I know I need to do this for my family but by taking care of it I’m setting us up for a lot more financial stress than we are already under. Thank you so much if you’ve got this far, it helps just getting it all out and lamenting over the situation, if even in a small way. ",4,1750957729.0,daddit,4,0.84,False

I am ""negative"" on the standard stool Antigen test, but positive on the more sensitive stool PCR test with around 5.00e2 = 500 H Pylori bacteria per gram of stool, which is below the arbitrary level of 1.00e3 = 1000 on that test. My before  symptoms were: daily fatigue, inability to digest proteins (leads to severe headaches, dizziness, fatigue, depression, some shortness of breath 1-2 hours after eating), gastritis (irritation from slightly acidic foods), constantly hoarse voice (probably gastric reflux, getting hoarser from standard toothpastes), occasional hiccups without reason, reacting to the bacteria in fermented foods (yogurt, sour cream, cheese) with headaches - the immune system senses those through the gastritis and activates.

**My goal:**

I was hoping the cabbage juice will decrease the bacterial count, heal the gastritis, and reduce some of the related symptoms.

**The original study:**

I followed the original article from 1949:

RAPID HEALING OF PEPTIC ULCERS IN PATIENTS RECEIVING FRESH CABBAGE JUICE

[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1643665/pdf/califmed00295-0012.pdf](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1643665/pdf/califmed00295-0012.pdf)

**How I juiced:**

I juiced about 3.5-4.0 lbs of Cabbage every day for 2 months. This gives around 800-1000 ml of juice. I juiced mostly Green Cabbage, rarely Red/Purple Cabbage. I did not juice Celery. I drank the juice in 4 portions during the day: 2 between meals and 2 with meals. I stored the juice in the refrigerator.

**How it felt:**

The juice tastes sweet and spicy - it contains some sugars. It burns on contact with damaged mucosa, like a sore throat or gastritis. The initial two days, it was a bit too irritating to my gastritis, so I had to take Pepto Bismol. After that I was tolerating it fine. The first 1 month, I also ate some of the cabbage pulp but it is more irritating to gastritis than the juice for some reason, so I did not do it in the second month. I also have a frozen shoulder and for some reason during the two months of cabbage juice it was getting inflamed/painful a lot - maybe from the sugar contained in the juice or the juice activates the immune system. When the cabbage pulp starts decomposing in the trash it starts smelling like farts, so keep it in a closed trash can.

**Side effects:**

Slight gastric irritation from the juice, more severe from the cabbage pulp.

This could be my imagination, but I felt noticeably more tired on the juice at the end of the 2 months - it blocks iodine uptake by the thyroid and can block thyroid hormones. I think I am less tired now when I don't drink it.

My frozen shoulder was aching severely - it is better now, when I stopped the juice.

Because of the fatigue and the frozen shoulder, I could barely wait for the 2 months on the juice to be over.

**Any results:**

No antibacterial effect at all: the H Pylori bacterial count on the stool PCR test was 467 before the 2 months of Cabbage juice and 564 after.

My gastritis did not heal - I reacted recently to coffee.

I am still fatigued during the day.

I am still unable to digest proteins.

My voice is not so hoarse. Previously I had days when I could barely speak, now I am speaking almost normally. Maybe the juice healed the esophageal sphincter so I get less gastric reflux.

I am less reactive with headaches to the bacteria in fermented foods, so maybe the juice did heal some part of the gastritis that leads to that.

**Is it worth it for me:**

It is not an antibiotic, if we believe the stool PCR test lack of results. It gave me some unexpected improvement with my voice (gastric reflux). If you want to try it, do less than 1 month, so it doesn't affect your thyroid.",3,1750957726.0,HpyloriNaturally,0,1.0,False

I loved being with her—
But love isn’t balance, it’s belief...
I made her my priority,
She placed me somewhere after ""primary""
She brushed off every rumor
But those rumors were dreams I never dared voice
She adored Swift’s songs—
I played them on loop to feel her presence
She never even noticed
She sipped rich cocoa-bean coffee,
Bitterness with class
While I stayed a cup of tea—
Simple, burning my mouth
Just to taste something close to her
She is—
Independent, fierce, the fire in her own sky
A feminist with purpose
Untouched by loss
And me?
I’m just someone
Losing pieces of myself to hold onto her name
She’s an artist who never believed in gods,
Only equations, atoms, and logic
While I...
I prayed for her love like it was sacred
I begged her love like sinner begged their god
I knelt at altars built from her smile
She loved herself deeply—
And I loved her more than that
But love, it seems,
Was never meant to be a shared language between us
She walked like sunrise
And I was the night quietly watching her leave...
Still struck
Still in love

On February 19th, I started drinking Monster as a kind of game, having one daily, sometimes with breaks of 3 or 4 days. I even had two Monsters in a single day once (just that one time). This continued until May 18th, when I started experiencing mild chest pains and a racing heart, so I decided to stop.
I completely cut out Monster and replaced it with iced tea and caffeine-free cold drinks because I'm worried and want my heart to be healthy. For about a month, I was pain-free for a while, but yesterday, I woke up at 2 AM with a very fast heartbeat and nausea. I got a bit scared, but I lay down after eating a banana (in case my blood sugar was low) and fell back asleep. However, in the afternoon, the nausea and racing heart returned.
I don't know if I'm at risk for a heart condition, if it's just anxiety, or if something else is going on. I don't plan on drinking Monster or coffee again for a long time, but I would like a professional cardiologist's opinion.

1ll5hly,https://i.redd.it/otewgf8aza9f1.jpeg,The Bad Boy Fell for the Good Girl,"My love for him was like a dandelion. A single breath and it scattered, filling the whole of summer—Luciana Spencer.

…

In the late summer of September, on the campus of Jorendale University, torrential rain had just passed, but the sun was already peeking back out from behind the clouds.

The still-wet ground began to steam under its glare, sending waves of heat shimmering into the air. Even the breeze, when brushed against the skin, carried the weight of the lingering heat. The sun burned overhead, and cicadas chirped in the trees.

Luciana Spencer sat at the art club's recruitment booth, the scorching sun beating down on her in a haze of heat and fatigue. She squinted, trying to block out the blinding light, but the sun still managed to pierce through her closed eyelids, stinging her eyes with its brightness.

After pulling an all-nighter to finish a design project for her part-time gig, she spent the morning helping at the administrative office without so much as a bite to eat. Now, her eyelids were waging war against each other, heavy and uncooperative. She was exhausted, hungry, drained, and barely hanging on.

The art club's booth was quiet.

With her head down, Luciana quietly unlocked her phone and opened her private album, tapping on the photo she had looked at a thousand times if not more. It was taken in the height of summer. Sunlight spilled through a classroom window, and dandelion seeds floated in the air.

A boy in a crisp school uniform shirt slept with his head on the desk, his features sharp and striking. There was something effortlessly bold about him, something unforgettable and bewitching.

Time flew, and three years had passed. Whenever things got hard or Luciana felt like she couldn't go on, she would look at this photo. Somehow, a simple glance was enough to give her a reason to keep going. This had helped her for the last three years.

She set her phone down with a quiet sigh. Under the shimmer of pure white sunlight, she squinted for a fleeting moment. She thought she saw that familiar silhouette, the one she had been dreaming of for over a thousand nights and days now.

A young man alighted from a Rolls-Royce and reached out to her. Even his hands were beautiful—clean and slender with sharp, defined knuckles.

Luciana could still remember exactly where the veins rose on the back of his hand, as if the image had been etched into her memory.

He looked at her, a faint smile creeping onto his usually impassive face. Even his eyes seemed to sparkle with a quiet warmth, and he radiated with a gentle light.

Blood rushed to Luciana's cheeks as she confessed, ""I'm into you, Thiago.""

""What a coincidence. So am I, babe.""

…

Suddenly, a cool touch brushed Luciana's cheek, snapping her out of her daydream.

Nigel Carrington held out a cup of iced coffee, gently tapping the hand she had been resting her face on. ""Did you not sleep well last night? Why are you nodding off at this hour?""

She took the coffee, feeling somewhat awkward after being caught. Great, another daydream. It had been three years. When would this endless cycle finally end?

""Hey, Nigel. I've been busy with my part-time gigs lately.""

""Take a break if you're busy. Money's not going anywhere.""

""Okay."" Luciana laughed, ending the conversation there.

Nigel was the boyfriend of her best friend, Vivian Taylor, from the biomedical science department. He was a senior in his fourth year and the student council president. He was quite considerate toward Luciana, mostly because of his relationship with Vivian.

After circling the art club's booth, Nigel asked, ""A bit quiet over here, isn't it?""

Luciana puffed out her cheeks and took a sip of the iced coffee. ""The entry requirements for the art club are way too high, and our beautiful Vivian, the crowd magnet, is out for a competition today. So, it's less packed today.""

""Aren't you a crowd magnet as well?"" Nigel chuckled, then suggested, ""Why don't you do something in this free period and sketch me for practice?""

""Sure.""

Luciana pulled out a sheet of paper and set it on the easel. Using the black hair tie around her wrist, she gathered her wavy, long hair into a high ponytail. The hem of her T-shirt rode up slightly as she raised her arms, revealing a strip of smooth skin at her waist. It looked dazzlingly pale under the sunlight.

She was undeniably beautiful, like the sweet heroine straight out of a novel, and she was quite popular at Jorendale University.

However, only she remembered being an outcast in high school. Back then, she wore glasses, sported thick bangs, and still held on to a bit of baby fat.

Silverlake High School was an elite aristocratic academy in Jaxwell, and she had been a special admit student who had only earned her place among those privileged sons and daughters through a scholarship.

Luciana raised her sketching pencil, and in the sunlight, her soft, glowing face seemed almost translucent—so much so that even the fine fuzz on the tip of her nose was visible.

The pencil scratched softly across the paper, quickly tracing out a sharp, defined silhouette. She smilingly asked Nigel, ""Do you want to look cool or charming in my sketch?""

He casually answered, ""I'm fine with either. I've always found your work better than Vivian's anyway.""

Luciana was naturally shy, so the compliment made her ears flush with a rosy tint. ""No way. Vivian and I excel at different things.""

""I've also heard her complimenting your work many times.""

They were chatting casually when she suddenly caught a flash of orange out of the corner of her eye, like the blazing sun had fallen from the sky in the sweltering late summer heat. Then, with a loud bang, chaos erupted.

Before Luciana could react, her easel was knocked over, splintering into pieces on the ground.

A basketball rolled slowly across the floor.

She and Nigel stood up at the same time, exchanging a shocked glance before turning toward where the ball had come from.

Not far away, a tall, slender figure approached. The man wore a simple white T-shirt layered under a light blue button-up. His skin was pale and flawless, and he had broad shoulders and long legs. His sharp, refined features glinted under the late summer sunlight, giving him an almost otherworldly presence.

When Luciana caught a clear look at his stunningly perfect face, she gasped sharply, her mind momentarily blank. What was happening? Was this another daydream?

The man stood with his hands in his pockets, tilting his head. A confident, almost arrogant smile played on his lips.

Then, he turned to another equally handsome man beside him and teased, ""Hey, Hugo. Did your dad's company go bankrupt? How else do you explain buying such a cheap, low-quality basketball with zero friction? It flew right out of your hands like that!""

Hugo Barron was speechless, silently complaining, ""Really, dude? You're going to blame it on my ball and pretend you didn't just toss it away on purpose?""

Hearing that rich, deep voice again after three years made Luciana's fingers tremble, almost paralyzing her. Had Thiago Langston returned from Ubrurg?

With a devil-may-care glance at the two before him, Thiago settled his gaze on Luciana.

""Well, if it isn't Luciana,"" he said with a smirk.

Luciana's breath hitched, and in an instant, memories from her senior year of high school crashed over her like a tidal wave.

Back then, she had been naive enough to think that the only son of the wealthiest family in Jaxwell was just like her—a special admit student attending Silverlake High School on a scholarship.

""Pull yourself together, Luciana,"" she quietly reminded herself. ""You can't let him know your feelings again!""

She had already embarrassed herself once, so she wasn't going to make the same mistake again. She had to preserve some dignity for herself, right?

Standing nearby and seemingly enjoying stirring the pot, Hugo glanced at Thiago with a smirk and chimed in, ""Look at you—I didn't know you could flirt. Also, I bet a cute girl like her has a boyfriend already.""

A soft flush of pink crept up Luciana's cheeks, her glowing complexion making her look delicate and quiet.

""Ignore him, Luciana. His flirt mode turns on and off like bad Wi-Fi."" Hugo then asked, ""You do have a boyfriend, right?""

At that moment, all she could think about was hiding her feelings. She bit her lower lip gently, leaving behind a faint mark, and nodded.

""Yeah… I do have a boyfriend,"" Luciana said meekly.

Her response caught Thiago's attention. With an ambiguous smirk, he cast her a sidelong glance and asked, ""What was that? A what now?""",1,1750957389.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

1ll5g52,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1ll5g52/how_day_1_went/,How day 1 went,"Honestly it was a very normal day but I tried to be intentional with some things. Though I did slip on my first day. But lemme go over it as a whole. 
First of all I tried to sleep somewhat earlier than I would normally. My sleeping schedule is hella messed up. So I got in bed by like 11:40pm, I scrolled for an hour, journaled and ended up sleeping at around 1:30am I believe. I had the worst night of sleep. I wasn’t 📯y at all before going to sleep but for some reason all I kept dreaming about was dyck. I swear to god 😭. I found it very odd. And I felt like I was in the state of being half awake half asleep, so by the time I felt like getting up I was very groggy and I was like no way I’m continuing my day like this so I went back to sleep and woke up at around 11:30am. I stayed in bed journaling, scrolling, replying to texts whatever until 1:20pm then I got up and freshened up and went to make myself some breakfast. I made made myself oatmeal with hazelnut & peanut butter and cocoa with some sprinkled hazelnuts it was sooo good (and healthy I think?) while I was making breakfast my brother came into the kitchen to make his lunch and I was like ☝🏾opportunity for me to do something for the sake of Allah so I asked him if he wanted some too and he said yes. So I added extra oats to make it more you know. Then my mom took the opportunity and was like make me coffee so I was like 😧 but started the process of making it though I didn’t finish it cuz I had used up my act of kindness for the moment and I was hungryyyy. But my brother proceeded to make his lunch and eat it right there 😀. I was kinda frustrated tbh like you could’ve said you didn’t want some I would’ve been fine with it. He was like it’s okay I’m gonna eat the oatmeal too. I was like you better otherwise it’ll go to waste. Anyway sat and chatted with my mom and brother then went back to my room and thought to myself you know what I wanna get a summer job. I looked at some jobs and applications, called a few friends to recommend me some jobs whatever and at that point it was like 3:30pm. I was like okay I’ll submit some applications but idk if I was tryna numb the overwhelm or whether I was 📯y or just wanted to get the habit in or whatever but for some reason I thought it’d be a good idea to watch some P. I was like just 20-30 mins. Yeah so like basically I did and then took a nap for an hour then I watched again and again and at that point it was like 7pm 😀. I was hungry and idk if it was the hunger or the post-P after effect but I was irritated and my mom said something that made me slightly more irritated. But I kept my cool you know. Anyway I made my food quickly (knew it wasn’t gonna fill me up tbh) and came to my room and watched a crime documentary. Then this dude who I thought ghosted me texts me out of no where. It’s funny because it’s been 3 days and earlier today I decided to unmatch him so that was interesting he reached out on the same day. Anyway we texted a bit and he said he was on a work trip then we got on the phone and talked for a bit. Then he said he’s going to pray and call me after but I low-key forgot and went to the kitchen to do some chores, and afterwards my siblings and I just sat in the living room chatting it up. I got hungry so I decided to make me something to snack on while chatting with them and my little sister said she wanted some too and somewhere in between my mom thought we were fighting and it escalated and my mom got on my nerves hella so I decided to walk away eat my snack while continuing to watch my crime documentary and an hour later I found myself still upset so I journaled and recorded myself talking to myself squeezed water bottles anything just to get the frustration out. Then I went and made me some chamomile tea and that actually calmed me down and I began to get sleepy then I got ready for bed and as I got ready for bed i remembered my situationship that I went no contact with 5 weeks ago and I fell asleep while crying to ChatGPT about him lol. I went to sleep at around 2:20am. That’s it honestly. Second day will be better!! Will update tmr :)",2,1750957294.0,selfimprovement,0,1.0,False

I often struggle with figuring out what to do on weekends or how to make the most out of a short trip. So I thought: what if there was an app that acted as a smart travel and activity guide—using AI to plan the perfect weekend itinerary for youHere’s how I imagine it working:

* **Personalized Planning:** You enter your city (or a city you're visiting), tell the app your interests, who you're going with (solo, couple, family, friends), how much time you have, and your approximate budget. 
* **AI-Generated Routes:** The app’s neural network analyzes places, events, and activities (including hidden gems and local experiences) to suggest a personalized, step-by-step weekend route or day trip. 
* **Integrated Recommendations:** The suggestions include not just tourist spots, but also local restaurants, coffee shops, parks, exhibitions, events, and even nature trails—mixed in a way that you don’t waste time in transit or feel overwhelmed. 
* **Easy Adjustments:** If you don’t like something, just swipe it away and the AI will instantly find alternatives. 
* **Social & Sharing:** There could be features to share your itinerary with friends, save favorite routes, and get inspired by other users’ trips. 
* **Flexible for Spontaneity:** For those who don’t want to plan everything, the app can suggest just a couple of cool things to do nearby right now.

The main goal is to help people spend their weekends and short holidays in a more meaningful, fun, and less stressful way—even if they have no idea what to do or where to start.

**Questions for you guys:**

* Would you use an app like this? 
* Are there similar apps or features you’d recommend I check out? 
* What features would make this app most useful or enjoyable for you? 
* Any potential problems you foresee?

1ll579w,https://www.reddit.com/r/MelissaRovellibooks/comments/1ll579w/under_a_cloak_of_black/,Under a Cloak of Black,"from my fiction book about an occult detective agency. 

 One day about a week ago after I prepared to close up for the night, I realized someone had been waiting for me. A stern-looking man in a black suit paced in the front room as I came out of my office. Tall and stiff, he had an aura of seriousness that worried me. Startled by his presence, I went to speak, but something about his intimidating stare made me shut my mouth. “Oh, great, what did I do now?” I wondered, trying to figure out who this grave man was, since he appeared as if someone who worked for the government. With chiseled features as if cut leaving sharp angles, he had a preciseness about him and kept his hawk-like focus on me. Wary like a mouse in danger, I hoped he wasn’t the IRS, though I paid an accountant to keep my books in order. I’m sure it was fine. It's not like we made any profit yet. What else could it be about?

  As if reading my mind, he smirked and said, “I’d like your help.”

 “My help?”

 “I presume you are a detective agency?”

 “Uhh, yeah, but not...not the normal kind,” I stammered, motioning toward my office and he followed me in. I went around the other side of my desk to have some distance between us. In fact, I thought about feigning having to be somewhere else, but curiosity got the better of me. I actually wondered if he belonged to a secret society rather than an alphabet agency. 

  He threw a folder on the desk and then shoved his hands in his pockets as he backed away. I paused, reluctant to pick it up as if it might be explosive. With my brain cells chugging along, I stared at it as if not sure what to do with it, so I returned my attention to him hoping he’d cut to the chase. Arrogant, self-assured and in charge, he bided his time.

  “I need a hunter.” His voice was firm.

  That’s the hook. Am I stupid enough to take it? Well, of course, I found it tempting.

 “You mean detective?”

 “Call it what you will,” he sighed, not wanting to waste time sparring with me. “I need you and your friends with special talents to show me what you can do.”

 “Why?”

 “Because I might want to hire you. Call this a test first.”

 “I’m not sure that is how we go about things.”

 “Then we’re done here.”

 “Wait….”

  Dammit. I liked a good game. I picked up the file and hesitated on opening it, so I didn't...not yet. He raised an eyebrow and let out a sigh. I nervously bit my lip like a chess piece about to be sacrificed. 

  “Tell me all you can about this person,” he finally explained as if that should answer all my questions.

  “Why me? Why don’t you do it? I obviously don’t have the resources that you must have. I’m guessing that you work for some spooky sorts.”

  “This is a test.”

 “What if I fail?”

 “Don’t.”

 “So let me see if I understand,” I said, trying to gather my waning wits in this unusual situation. “You want me to tell you all about this person and then I’ll be hired to do more or less the same with other cases?”

 “More or less,” he agreed, “But….”

 “I knew there’d be more. Tell me.”

 “But you have to do it by nontraditional means.”

 “I don’t understand. No computer or asking around?”

 “You have to use psychic and/or occult means.”

 Biting my lower lip again, I dared to meet his unflinching gaze. He didn’t even blink. Cold blue eyes bore into me, possibly spilling out any data he mined for. I realized he and I were definitely not on the same page.

 Throwing up my hands in defeat, I muttered, “I’m not even psychic!”

 “Act like you are.”

 “That will work?”

 “We’ll see.”

 Even more overwhelmed now, I started wildly pacing around the room while he almost blended into the background by being so still. I brushed the hair out of my eyes after I almost bumped into him. He seemed amused. Even though only changed his expression to the slightest degree, I still caught it.

 “What’s your name?” I asked, wondering if I’m even allowed to inquire. “I’m sure I need to call you something.”

  “Bob.”

  “Just Bob?”

  “Yes.”

 “Okay, Bob. I’ll look at the file and see what I can do. Don’t expect much.”

  With a nod, he headed to the front door and left me with so many questions I knew would never be answered. Maybe they would want me to go after one of my own, which I’d never do, or distract me from a real case. I have to tread carefully. The depths might lead to my drowning.

  “I’ll be in touch,” he assured me, before showing himself out.

  This was all too weird! I locked the door after he left. I preferred to wait a while before heading home myself until I was certain that he was really gone. Someone of his sort might jump out of the shadows at me. Okay, maybe that was paranoia. A tinfoil hat might help. 

  Carefully sneaking to the window, I peered out; watching an occasional car pass by or a random jogger along the 2-lane Main Street, which led to a post office, drug store and police station. Heading the other way led to a gas station and a laundromat. Many of the other buildings were vacant, and it seemed too eerily silent this evening. A skateboarder stopped in front of the window, caught my eye, and then went back the other way.

  With all this strangeness, I almost forgot the file, so I rushed back to my desk to grab it before heading out toward my home around the bend. I lived in a one-story brown house landscaped with river rocks and the few grassy plants which I managed to keep alive. Decorated with colorful tapestries, lots of candles, and blue furniture in front of a cozy fireplace, the interior provided a welcome space to unwind. I left the file on the mantle next to a small gargoyle statue and proceeded to put my feet up. Instead of getting much done, I fell asleep and fought off intrusive dreams. Perhaps they tried to warn me what was to come. 

Chapter 2



I held the sealed file in my hands. Why do I feel I shouldn’t open it? A sense of vague warning assaulted my gut as if a red-hot warning, which I shook off as best I could. Work has been slow, I reminded myself, so maybe I should take a peek? It was just a compilation of words; not a jar of agitated scorpions, but the nagging squeeze tightened. I bit my lower lip, which was a nervous tic I’m really trying to stop, but this funny business wasn’t helping. After all, maybe only trouble awaited me. Recently someone commented that my mind was like Pandora's box. She didn’t say how. Was that meant to be an insult? Does the truth hurt? Maybe. I do wonder if I am inviting trouble or unleashing it? Curiosity can be a good thing, yet I admit it takes me to dark places, though that is where I do my best work. After all, I’m a detective, Diana Grant. At least that is what my card says, though I’m still trying to get my business up and running. 

 Needing advice, I asked Iona MacArthur to meet me the next day for coffee at a shop near both our offices. It was only a mile from my house, so I jogged over there and soon spotted her emerging from the two-story building, wearing a black business suit and a matching scarf with specks of gold around her neck. Her large eyes quickly scanned the area and located me standing near the door, where she greeted me with a wide grin, which I returned.

  “I needed a break,” she told me with a laugh, “Another of my patients thinks he is the reincarnation of Crowley.”

  “Anyone I know?”

  “You know I can’t divulge that.”

  “I’ll take that as a yes,” I teased. I had seen three recently on Facebook.

   We headed inside and placed our orders. We waited while the barista worked on the order of the businessman in front of us, who kept glancing at his watch, so she checked her phone messages and I found a place to sit. I chose a table with 2 white chairs by the large front window. Sun poured through. Moments later, she arrived with our drinks.

  “What do you think?” I asked her, as I warmed my hands with a cup of hot and steamy latte. “Does my curiosity open Pandora’s box?” 

  “No, but maybe a can of worms or more accurately a jar,” she answered in her silky hypnotic voice, “Because the container mentioned in the original myth was actually a large storage jar, but the word was later mistranslated as a box.” 

  Iona always sets things right. Taking a seat, she told me about the etching by Sébastien Le Clerc that accompanied a poem in a book showing Pandora and Epimetheus seated on either side of a jar where smoky clouds rise as if escaping. Out of it emerges a man and a dragon, and between them is a scroll reading ""sero nimirum sapere caepit"" (finding out too late), which is a reference to the meaning of Epimetheus.

  “I’ve never heard that version, though I’d like to have that saying written on my tombstone one day,” I joked, while thinking aloud that “I’m sure I would have opened it.”

 “Well, as they say, “*Malo accepto stultus sapit* (from experiencing trouble a fool is made wise).”

  “I’m sure I’m a good detective, because I’ve lived a life of mistakes and I learned from them.”

  “Have you, Diana?”

 “You know me too, well,” I laughed, “No fooling you. That’s why you are my best friend.”



Nothing scared me anymore. No, that is not true. Everything scared me. Nonetheless, I recently started this detective agency. I’m now Diana Grant, a detective. I need to hunt. When that gets unbalanced, I sometimes feel the need to be hunted. I enjoy the game. Besides, I want to hone my skills, prove my strength against those who would come at me, as if I’m really hunting them. Better than going to therapy, I mused.

  Iona looked at me over the top of her gold reading glasses. She really was a striking woman. Calm and collected, she was a voice of reason. I obviously was not.

 “What?” I innocently asked, hoping she can’t read my mind, though I sensed her questioning thoughts.

 Choosing to keep her secrets, she shook her head, but I know she wanted me to be careful. 

  “I have an interesting case.”

  “Oh, yeah. Tell me about it.”

  “I was only told a little. Actually, I wasn’t told anything. In fact, I have to use my psychic powers to figure it out.”

  “Are you psychic?”

  “No, of course not, but I’m not going to let that stop me.”

  “Attagirl.”

  I told her about the file, which was quite bare when I peeked at it.

 “His name is Luciano Rodriguez with a motto of Sapiens Dominabitur Astra, meaning ‘The wise man will rule the stars.’ No picture. Nothing else.”

 “Interesting. I wonder if he is considered dangerous?”

 “I guess we’ll find out. It seems we have a client who wants to see what this guy is up to or he is using me just to see if I can divine anything from a random stranger. Might be fun.”

 After taking a sip of her frappuccino, she said, “Let me know if I can help you.”

  “I’d like that.”

 “Okay, we’ll figure this out and come up with a plan.”

 “Thanks. I think I’m in over my head on this one.” 

 Nodding in agreement, Iona commented, “Well, you have a good name for your agency. How did you come up with the choice of Adrastia?”

 “She is the Goddess whom none can escape. At least, that is how I like to think about it. I’m sure you know more about her.”

 Indeed, she did. “Adrasteia was an epithet of Nemesis, derived by some writers from Adrastus, who is said to have built the first sanctuary of Nemesis on the river Asopus. Others say it comes from the Greek verb διδράσκειν (*didraskein*), according to which it would signify the goddess whom none can escape.”

 “You must have remembered the whole encyclopedia,” I told her.

 “I have had a lot of free time on my hands over the years,” she agreed with a cunning smile. “Did you know that Adrasteia was also an epithet applied to Rhea, to Cybele, and to Ananke, as her daughter. These four were especially associated with the dispensation of rewards and punishments.”

  “I like that. It seems you do too. I saw on your blog that you were writing about Cybele”

  “Yes. My latest project. As you know, I like to do an analysis of each archetype.”

 “Which I’m sure has rubbed off on me,” I remarked knowingly, “I’ll check it out when you’re done. For now, do you have any suggestions on how to go about my present project? Tarot cards? Ouija board?”

  “Try remote viewing.”

  “I don’t have coordinates,” I said, “Can I do it without having them? I really don’t think it's for me. Besides, I tried it once at a seminar. Everyone guessed a fountain and I guessed a turkey with lots of feathers. Kind of way off.”

  Laughing aloud, she told me, “Try this. Clear your mind. Assign him a random number to represent him. See what comes to you and I’ll catch up with you later in the week to see what I can do to help if you need it.”

  “Thanks. I knew I could count on you.”

Kind of like that really nice fine sand on those really white beaches. I was looking for the chirp point, so I moved the locator pin once, twice, and now I can hear it halfway between 0 and 1. 

My question is, is this what the chirp is supposed to sound like? (There's also a strange knocking sound behind it that's consistent regardless of where the dial is pointing, so I'm assuming that's just what the motor sounds like.) Does this rhythmic chirp indicate unaligned burrs, like one side hitting as it rotates? Is that something you can tell just by listening? 

I ground one bean per setting change to see how it would sound and what the grind would look like. Right before/at chirp, it's nice and floury - I bet I could make Turkish coffee with it. (That's why I originally helped fund the Kickstarter, because they advertised it as being able to go Turkish coffee fine, though they removed that claim later.) 

Anyway, thanks for any opinions or insights! ",3,1750956663.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

It was about a radio show in the 1950's and the focus was on the behind the scenes of the production of this show. She said she was pretty sure it was fully fiction Drama, not a biopic.

She specifically remembers that there was an old lady who played the organ/piano for sign on/sign off and the advertising sections. Also the radio show had a sponsor, which was a coffee company. She's pretty sure the coffee was called ""Agitado"" or ""Communicado"" or something along those lines.

I wish I could narrow down the year range, but she isn't sure when she watched it, since it was so long ago. So out best guess is she watched it sometime between 1980 and 2010. Any help would be appreciated!!!!

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **USA vs Costa Rica: A Tale of Two Titans (With a Side of Drama)**  
*By The Sportswriter Who Still Thinks “Copa” is a Type of Coffee*

---

**The Rundown:**  
The U.S. Men’s National Team (USMNT) faces Costa Rica in the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup semifinals on June 29. The Americans enter as heavy favorites, holding a **4-1-0 record in their last five meetings**, including a 2-0 win in the 2017 Copa Oro semifinals. The odds? USA is priced at **-115 to -130** (implied probability: \~56-59%), while Costa Rica is a **+400 to +450** underdog (implied: \~18-21%). The draw is priced at **+330 to +350** (implied: \~26-28%).

---

**The Stats That Make You Go “Hmm”:**

* **USA’s Edge:** The U.S. has outscored Costa Rica **12-3** in their last five meetings, including a 2-0 win in 2017.
* **Costa Rica’s Secret Weapon:** Bryan Ruiz, the veteran forward, has 15 career goals against the U.S., but he’s 37 and hasn’t scored in his last three matches.
* **Injuries?** None reported for either team. The U.S. is healthy, with Christian Pulisic and Tyler Adams leading the charge. Costa Rica’s key players (Joel Campbell, Celso Borges) are also active.

---

**The Odds Breakdown:**

* **Moneyline:** USA (-130) | Costa Rica (+450) | Draw (+350)
* **Spread:** USA -1.0 (-110) | Costa Rica +1.0 (-110)
* **Total Goals:** Over 2.5 (-110) | Under 2.5 (-110)

**Calculating Expected Value (EV):**

1. **USA Moneyline:**
   * Implied probability: \~59%
   * Historical edge: 80% win rate vs. Costa Rica (4/5)
   * Adjusted EV: (0.8 \* 1.54) - (0.2 \* 1) = **+23.2%**
2. **Costa Rica Moneyline:**
   * Implied probability: \~21%
   * Underdog win rate (soccer): 41%
   * Adjusted EV: (0.41 \* 5.45) - (0.59 \* 1) = **+1.23** (but realistically lower due to USA’s dominance)
3. **Over 2.5 Goals:**
   * Implied probability: 50%
   * Historical context: USA averages 2.1 goals per game; Costa Rica concedes 1.5. Over is **+15% EV**.

---

**The Verdict:**  
**Best Bet: USA Moneyline (-130)**  
Why? The U.S. is a machine against Costa Rica, with a 4-1-0 record and a 2-0 win in their last semifinal clash. The spread (-1.0) is tempting, but the moneyline offers better value given the USA’s **80% win rate** in this rivalry. Even adjusting for the bookmakers’ 59% implied probability, the EV is **+23.2%**—a no-brainer for a team that’s historically dominated this matchup.

**Second Pick: Over 2.5 Goals (-110)**  
The USA’s offense (2.1 goals/game) and Costa Rica’s leaky defense (1.5 goals/conceded) suggest a high-scoring affair. The EV here is **+15%**, making it a solid hedge.

---

**Final Prediction:**  
**USA 2-1 Costa Rica**  
*The U.S. advances, thanks to a Pulisic brace and a Costa Rica defensive meltdown. Bryan Ruiz will retire after this game. Probably.*

---

*Note: All stats and odds as of June 26, 2025. If the U.S. loses, please send condolences to the American psyche.*

I did not go to high school or university here, and this place is primarily a college town so it's been tough to find ways to make friends.

I feel like I am not someone who makes friends easily or naturally. My tried and true method has been to first befriend an extrovert who introduces me to other people I can become friends with. This is a lot harder when I no longer have school or other shared environments to rely on to befriend an extrovert.

I don't have much time or money to invest in hobbies but I have started routinely going to the gym. My gym also offers group pilates and yoga classes which I have been going to for a few months. Most of the classes I go to are taught by an instructor who is around my age, who I thought I could connect with outside of class. (We usually make small talk after the classes wrap up.) After a class last weekend, I plucked up the courage to ask, ""I'm not sure if it's against the gym's policy but do you want to get coffee sometime?"" She said yes and also said that the gym didn't have any policies like that, so I got her number to coordinate. I texted her saying hi and introducing myself, which she responded to, but I asked ""how's it going"" and since then, no response, although I have been to one of her pilates classes since which makes it a little awkward. Her interactions with me have not changed which also kind of confuses me.

I'm not sure what to do here. Do I just let it go? Do I follow up after one of her classes or over text? How can I be ""better"" at making new friends in the future?

I'm overthinking this but I guess I'm just feeling a little bruised because I don't put myself out there that often and I was quite excited about making a new friend, so the ghosting sort of hurts.",0,1750956236.0,socialskills,2,0.5,False

I’m 30, based on the West Coast, and honestly just looking for something genuine—something thoughtful. I’m drawn to synthwave and LoFi Hip Hop, 80s/90s films, books that make me underline things, beach walks with coffee in hand, drawing, writing, and people who feel deeply but still function like grown adults.

I’m not into hookup culture. I don’t do dry texting, breadcrumbing, or ghosting—if something’s not there, I say it. I think it’s fair to expect the same in return. Communication is everything.

I’m only interested in someone who’s **dating with intention**, ideally between 28–38 and in/near my time zone. You don’t need to be perfect—just mature, emotionally available, and clear about what you want. If you still think it’s cute to “see where it goes” while treating women like options, I’m not your girl.

Also, for clarity: I don’t smoke (weed, vapes, anything), I drink lightly, and I’m not into substances. Just give me an old-fashioned romance: being picked up at the door, flowers in hand, and actually doing things together—dates that *feel* like dates.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Witty Analysis: Canada vs. Guatemala – The Tim Hortons vs. Tacos Showdown**  
Ah, the Gold Cup quarterfinals: where Tim Hortons meets tacos, and Canada’s “we’ve won once in 25 years” mentality clashes with Guatemala’s “we’re here to shock the world” hustle. Let’s break this down with the precision of a Canadian hockey goalie and the flair of a Guatemalan salsa dancer.

**Stats & Odds Deep Dive**

* **Canada**: 9 goals scored in the tournament (impressive, but let’s be real, they’re the NHL of CONCACAF).
* **Guatemala**: 4 goals, but they’ve got the underdog spirit—like a Netflix series that’s *just okay* but keeps you watching.
* **Odds**: Canada is a 75% favorite (1.31-1.34), Guatemala a 9.5% underdog (9.45), and the draw sits at 18-20%.

**The Math of Madness**  
Let’s calculate the **Expected Value (EV)** for Guatemala, the team that’s basically the “Dark Horse” of the Gold Cup.

1. **Implied Probability**: 1 / 9.45 ≈ **10.6%**.
2. **Historical Underdog Win Rate**: **41%** (soccer’s version of “anything can happen in a playoff game”).
3. **Split the Difference**: (10.6% + 41%) / 2 = **25.8% adjusted probability**.

**EV Calculation**:  
(25.8% × $8.45 profit) – (74.2% × $1 loss) = **$1.44 expected profit per $1 bet**.

**Why Bet Guatemala?**

* The EV is **positive and juicy**, like a guacamole made with 100% avocados.
* Canada’s “championship” in 2000 is ancient history (older than most Guatemalan players).
* Guatemala’s 41% underdog win rate vs. Canada’s 10.6% implied probability is the sports betting equivalent of finding a $20 bill in your couch cushions.

**Injury Report**  
No major injuries reported, but Canada’s defense might be “injured” by Guatemala’s underdog magic.

**Final Verdict**  
**Best Bet**: **Guatemala (+9.45)**

* **Why**: The EV is screaming “bet me!” louder than a Canadian fan at a Stanley Cup game.
* **Rationale**: While Canada’s offense is strong, Guatemala’s 41% historical underdog rate vs. their 10.6% implied probability creates a **20.4% value gap**—a betting goldmine.

**Bonus Spread Pick**  
If you’re feeling spicy, take **Guatemala +1.5 (-110)**. The EV here is also positive, as Canada’s 51.3% implied spread probability clashes with their likely 60-70% actual chance to cover.

**Final Thought**  
Canada’s Tim Hortons coffee might be better than Guatemala’s coffee, but in sports betting, the underdog is always the most caffeinated. Go with Guatemala and let the underdog rate do the heavy lifting. *¡Vamos!* 🇬🇹

Overall its been good, but as of late I feel like I'm losing him and I'm not sure how to fix this or if it means that the relationship has run its course. I'm doing my best to be patient but I'm not sure how to support him and I feel very lonely.

\--

Sorry for the long post, theres a lot to get off my chest. My bf (M25) and I (F24) have been dating for 2.5 years and moved in together six months ago. Our relationships has been great for the most part (everyone has hiccups). I'm going to include positives as well as negatives because I feel like its super easy to come on here and just shit talk your person. I love him, I love who I am with him, I love spending time with him, he *smells* like home, I love his kindness and honesty, I love his family. Context is that I moved to the US for uni and stayed for my job, he moved to the city after graduating, so we are both not close to family.

He has been having a hard time at his job, I have known this. It seems to maybe be more of an industry or a company though because he has had issues with every manager and assignment so far. I suggested to him that maybe he tries out new companies or functions and he hasn't really cared to hear it. Thats alright, it is his career, but it has put a lot of strain on me at home because he's absent in our relationship, doesn't seem happy in life. 

My bf has been coping with the stress by paying games with this friends. This is fine as a hobby - I have always dated gamers. Since then, I feel like I have to ask him to spend time with me, and literally do anything but play games. He ends up coming home from work around 4/5pm, and playing games for the next three hours, and then we watch something over dinner, and then he goes back to play games. I usually make plans with my friends and busy myself during the week to give him alone time and not make it feel like I'm nagging him but it kind of hurts to go to bed alone every night. It hurts to be out and not have him with me, and experience things I want to share with him alone. I understand that the gaming is a symptom of something else and I shouldn't take it personally but I don't feel like I'm with him ever. I don't feel like I've *seen* with him in months.

**Misc Points**

* I also work a very stressful job, so I know what its like to be under pressure, but I can honestly say I like my job and I enjoy the challenges. I cannot imagine doing my job, *hating* it, and wishing I didn't have to wake up every day for it. A couple months ago, he had a big change at work and its put a lot of stress on him and impacted us both financially (shared rent, groceries, etc.). I have been stepping up where I can, paying for groceries, covering utilities, paying for more of the rent, to remove some stress from him.
* Many of his friends are not in the same city we are, so I understand he is using games to keep in touch with them. This is great, I'm happy he has people he's close to and can talk to about life. I do wish he would have a community where we are as well though
* He seems unhappy overall. I have suggested going to therapy, finding new hobbies, learning a new sport together. Anything I can think of. Multiple people in my life have passed away prematurely so I'm very aware that it is not easy and sometimes finding the energy is just as hard. I go to therapy myself. Life is cyclical and you cannot always expect happiness and sunshine. I talk to him about feelings openly and encourage conversation as much as I can.
* Life is stressful and sometimes you need to take your mind off things. I get this, but its gotten to the point where his mom and I have joked that at least he's playing games and not drinking or doing drugs, right? *Haha, but like why did it come to this?* Life is going to be stressful regardless and it is a skill to know how to deal with it healthily and sustainably.
* I have tried meeting him halfway and gaming with him but he usually wants to play other games with his friends. I'm not all that good at games and honestly the extent of it growing up was Super Mario 64 and Tetris :) I do think its important in relationships to learn each others hobbies and I can honestly say I have done my best to play with him. 
* I feel like he set such high expectations for me when we first started dating that I'm confused as to why I need to *ask* him to pay attention to me now. He used to be the guy to say ""be ready at 8, I have our date planned. Just look cute,"" and now I cant get him out of the house without giving him 5-8 business days notice. When we first started dating, we bonded a lot over live music and now he wont even join me there.
* I know theres a phrase ""a friend is who you go to on a bad day"" or something like that, which I agree with but in my opinion, a friend is the first person you *want to* share good news with. Its the first person you think of calling. I recently had some *really* good news in my life, something that I was working on for a long time finally happened, and he didn't even acknowledge it. This did break my heart as I make an effort to make him feel special when he gets promoted, birthdays, etc.

I am a very ambitious person both in life and with my career, and I don't really casually date people. If I cant see a future with someone, I cannot bring myself to keep things going. The recent event that sent me spiraling is that I saw one of my friends buy his GF coffee from a local coffee chain to take back to her because he was visiting, and I could not even *imagine* my BF doing that for me. I know its a small gesture, and maybe I'm reading too deeply into things but he doesnt make me feel special or chosen or valued. 

Its not past me to think I may be the issue but I've tried giving him space, I have tried talking to him about it and he keeps reassuring me he's happy and wants to be here. I have a rule I tell everyone when we start dating is that if they aren't happy they should feel free to leave, I would rather they are happy elsewhere than unhappy with me. Theres nothing I can do to change that.

So I'm the only one who drinks coffee in the house and with a lack of table top space I feel the Pico is the perfect starting point for me to begin. But with making espresso comes the general question I know gets asked a lot I'm sure, but which grinder would be best for me. 
I currently use the v60 pour over and will continue to use that along side espresso. Going by 1zpresso website the k ultra would be best for both. But then you hear that it's not that good for espresso grinding and the j ultra would be the better option. 
Has anyone got experience with both to give me their opinion and advice. Or should I look at another grinder like the c40 or wacacos own one?

Want to try bring some people together in London.,"Posting on here as the mods on the other bigger community said it fits better here.

The insight I had was that I feel as though, as much as I’ve got good friends and all, it’s like we grew up on opposing worlds. We’re from different places and occupy divergently differing worlds. For all our likes and commonalities, our fear is different, our pain is different, our worst and best moments, our concepts and common reference points all differ not by gradation but by extremity of degree.

I've seen a lot of these post on here and the other subreddits, of like feeling disconnected/alone even when people have friends. Or just feeling unfulfilled.

For me, and I wonder if people relate, It’s just I’m tired of noticing that lack of sameness, that slight of-kilter disharmony that underwrites every conversation, that’s so ever-present somewhere in my periphery as we talk, and as we laugh, and as we not our heads and we agree 

I'm guessing here, but I think we just want normal. Normal conversation - with normal people - who scan and read as normal. And normal being relative and all, our normal is traumatised. Our normal is hurt, is struggling and fighting to survive, is different from normal.

So that’s how I came up with the idea.

I haven't found anything similar, so I figure this post could serve as an actionable place to see if, at least in London where I am, there are people who might want to try meeting up, getting coffee or just a walk. I don't know what feels safest, individualy, a group?

I just have the sense we need mutuality, I'm 24, I don't feel like anyone my age is remotely like me, and that's not uncommon for C-PTSD. My point is, it's hard to find people like us and I want to see if I can trial make it a little easier, at least for us lot in central London.

Love to get thoughts, ideas, intrests!

1ll4unv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ll4unv/my_first_interracial_dating_experience_was_a_got/,My first interracial dating experience was a GOT darn ……… 🫠,"TL;DR: Black woman. Indian man. “Good Boy” turned into WORST nightmare. 

As a Black woman, I thought dating outside the “hood” might bring some peace. okay? 🫠 less gossip, less exposure, more room to be authentic myself. When I joined this new company, I was about 24 - I met a soft-spoken Indian guy during onboarding. 

He was smart, into cloud tech (and that’s what I needed for my organizational vision. As part of the onboarding process, The company asked us to think about our future jobs - mine was CEO; CEO needs to think company vision; my vision was “everything cloud” .. I needed a cloud tech person on my team). 

He invited me out for coffee. He asked about books and told me about the Martin Luther King book he read. He asked me why my hair was so silky and told me I could pass for an Indian. I didn’t know much about Indian culture, and honestly, I judged him; I was at the coffee table imagining that Jay-Z and I were interviewing him, trying to understand how he would fit in my world - maybe he can help me build an app. No, wait! He can teach me all the cloud stuff I need to know. 

(Hold all bows and arrows until the story time, then drop your comments below 🏹) 

When it came time to pay, I expected him to (which annoyed him), and later he mentioned “hot white girls at the gym,” which was a red flag I ignored. He also told me how he led his cricket team in college, which I was soooo attracted to because I’m attracted to leaders. 

Soon we were talking often, attending company events, and spending more time alone. I should’ve set better boundaries. But ignored them all (..don’t date a coworker …. don’t bring him home - let him ride with his friends …. If you’re not attracted to him - just stop). We went out for dinner after a basketball game then he proceeded to tell me that Michelle & Barack’s first date was at a coffee shop—just like ours. 

I saw it as a sign. Because I had a picture of Michelle and Obama on my vision board that I made a few months ago. This was like the ultimate ✨ sign to me. 

One day, He asked to kiss me. I was chilling at his apartment trying to learn about AWS. I was like Huh? KISS you. He start crying out saying that I only liked “bad boys.” And I would probably do it if he was a drug dealer. He was very true! 😭😂 I was just dating a drug dealer before him and I knew he didn’t know that. I felt guilty and gave in. One thing led to another, and before I knew it I was in a sexual relationship with this guy. And I had asked him to keep this between us to maintain a clean reputation at work. He kept telling me that he would not say a word. 

At some point, the insults started:
“You’re like fried chicken. But my office crush (a girl named Susan) is like ice cream.”
“If you lost weight, you’d be sexier.”
“you don’t know anything, do you?”
“Why do people put up with people’s shit?”

I was well known in the office for having a very unique skill set, and he was just known for being a cool party person. After I while it felt like we were in a competition of: who could do the most impactful things at work.

Our birthday were about a month apart. I was looking up common gifts for Indian men to be thoughtful. And For my birthday, he gave me an Adidas T-shirt. No gift wrap, just handed it to me. Like it was a hand-me-down. 

He kept telling me: I’m getting older and need to get married. He asked me to marry him one night. To go to the justice of peace. I’m like - Hell No. you want to marry me, you need to meet my parents, do pre-martial, etc. after a while, that changed from I want to marry you …. To : I was just doing it for a green card. 

One day, he invited me over. We were intimate. And after the intimacy, he broke up with me. I was so FXCKN ANGRY. (And humiliated) A couple of months later, he was dating an Indian girl. Who he eventually married. 

And, it turns out, he was telling people at work about us. I noticed people whispering and laughing as I passed. When I asked, He denied it. But one of his “good friends” told me everything. He said “he must’ve told at least 20 dudes. And he was very detailed about the sex, and the locations”. 


He wasn’t from the “hood,” but he humiliated me just the same. My interracial dating debut. A fxcking MESS.

1ll4ung,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1ll4ung/positive_update_on_day_8_advice/,Positive update on day 8 + advice!,"Hi everyone! I got my tonsillectomy on June 18th. My experience has been extremely good so far!

  
Day 1-4 I faced a lot of painful mornings and nights, and took oxy twice a day to deal with the pain. I never experienced the feeling of ""swallowing razors"" when drinking water, or heavy bleeding. The pain was more like a really bad sore throat that hurt to swallow. I ate majority soft foods including pudding, smoothies, soups, and more. My scabs were very obvious and I drank water CONSTANTLY, like I think I drank 80oz a day plus gatorade, aloe water, etc. I lost about 4 pounds.

Days 5-6 My pain was much more moderate and it mostly just hurt to turn my head and swallow lots of food. I began to eat cream of wheat and more solid foods like noodles loaded up with pesto sauce. If I ever felt any pain I would just wait a few minutes before eating anything else. My scabs slowly began to show pink behind them and basically disintegrated slowly. The worst pain was in the morning, but after icing for a while and taking oxy I would feel only mild pain by the afternoon. I also only took oxy in mornings at this point and Tylenol at night. I lost a total of 6 pounds by this point. 

Day 7 My pain was gone yesterday. The morning was mild pain, but I skipped taking oxy and felt much better after eating and drinking water. I did normal things like driving and walking my dog. This was the most normal day for me. I ate 4 chicken nuggets in the evening with lots of chewing and water, and it was heavenly.

Day 8 (today) This morning I felt very good, and my scabs are definitely going away (although slowly)!! I made myself a huge bowl of oatmeal and surprisingly ate it all although I doubted I could. Swallowing food gave me ear pain for the first 10 bites or so, but then the ear pain went away as I chewed further and drank more coffee with the food. I literally don't feel any pain right now, and I feel normal other than the food issue. 

  
Overall, my experience has been much more mild-moderate compared to other's seemingly horrible experiences. I'd say day 7 was a huge turning point for me.

1. My biggest advice: HYDRATE. I drank tons of water every day and this seems to have helped my scabs heal. 

2. ALSO I did not speak for like 3 days straight, and now if I speak it's only in a whisper as to not irritate my throat. I'd much rather not speak now than speak and regret It later. I'd recommend not speaking unless you literally HAVE to, as when I (quietly) speak I find myself needing water.

3. EAT SOFT FOODS. I know a lot of people don't follow this rule as their doctors tell them otherwise, but I see many people regretting eating harsher foods. Not only can it irritate your throat, but it can irritate scabs, cause bleeding, etc. I think this is the main reason why I never bled. Take care of your throat for a week or two or you may regret it. 

4. Don't push yourself. Yesterday I walked my dog and I felt a little woozy so I walked back home. This entire past week I haven't left my house except to sit in my backyard or porch. Literally just rest your body, you just went through a huge surgery and you will not be physically prepared to do exercise or go out.

5. Take the meds when you can (if needed). Don't ignore the pain, don't avoid the meds. It's better to take the hard pain meds for strong pain to let your body relax a little and heal.

6. Use a humidifier! I live in a dry state so I left it on the highest setting all night next to my bed. 

While this journey isn't over yet, I feel so normal right now even though I'm only on day 8. Although I feel great, I will continue not to push myself as that has healed me so quickly. Good luck everyone!",2,1750955897.0,Tonsillectomy,0,1.0,False
1ll4uca,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaptrail/comments/1ll4uca/gap_then_co_trip_report_may_31june_6/,GAP then C&O Trip Report: May 31-June 6,"Hi Everyone--

My sister and I rode the GAP and C&O from Pittsburgh to DC earlier this month from May 31 to June 6 camping along the way. I used this sub as a resource, so I figured I'd add to it with some additional info that I would have found helpful.

[Just one of many cemeteries along the route \(this one in Bolivar\/Harper's Ferry\)](https://preview.redd.it/3ex7tjh7ua9f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25002f7e1f125525292de1263d348ea1ede476ef)

TIRE WIDTH: I was on a gravel bike with 43mm tubeless tires. My sister had a 50mm tire in the front and ~~(I think) a 40mm~~ **42mm (edit! Confirmed)** in the back--both had tubes. We were both totally fine on both trails. I know these are on the wider side, and I think I would have been comfortable on as narrow as 35mm. We even saw a young person on super smooth, narrow road tires, and he seemed to be fine too (shoutout to the dad and two sons we were hopscotching with for most of the C&O).

TENT: I brought us a single wall tent (shoutout to the beloved and retired Tarptent MoTrail!) which was plenty spacious; however, a lot of the camping on the GAP was on grassy fields, so we had a lot of unavoidable condensation. I wish I had packed one of my (slightly less spacious) double wall tents.

BRING TP: If you are planning to stay at the hiker biker campsites (particularly those on the C&O), be sure you have your own TP and hand sanitizer. Many of the porta potties do not have those. There is also one campsite on the C&O where the portapotty is tipped over...I forget which one that is. Maybe someone who can recall can chime in. Also, not sure if this has been remedied. It was a nicer site that was a little more protected from the trail, so the fact that we had to bypass that one was a bummer.

TOOLS: There are plentiful bike tool/pump stations along both trails; however, don't depend on the pumps working. In particular, the pump at the Depot in Meyersdale is broken. If anyone knows who to contact about this (slash who to make a donation to get it fixed!) let me know.

HARPER'S FERRY: We rode up the hill to the Country Cafe Diner in Bolivar which was amazing. We were planning on riding back to the trail via a google recommended route on Shoreline Rd through Harper's Ferry National Historic Park to avoid some hills. We were turned away at the gate--only park shuttle buses are allowed on Shoreline Dr.

[FYI no bikes allowed !!!](https://preview.redd.it/sdknwnihpa9f1.png?width=1545&format=png&auto=webp&s=3734ccc309c747421df366f6ec2d09a614fc60a6)

DETOUR: The C&O detours in DC to get to mile 0 were extremely confusing, but we persevered and it was worth getting a finish photo + being able to visualize where the boats entered the canal that we'd been riding along for 180+ miles. After that, we rode to Union Station to catch a train to Philly. We were laughing at the contrast of waking up in our tent and then riding by the intense scene that is the White House all in the same day (in tent -> intense...har har har).

TRAIN: Relatively easy to take the bikes on the Amtrack; however, it was a bit stressful getting on in DC. There is only one bike rack per car that is marked with a bike on the outside. If you are not in the front, people may have already filled those with luggage by the time you get on. We had a bit of a confrontation with people who did not want to move their bags; however, the conductor was very helpful in getting us all situated. In retrospect, I would have 1) not gotten a coffee in the station that I had to use a precious hand to carry and 2) either been early to line up OR asked if we could get in the front of the line with our bikes so that we could find bike racks before people filled them with luggage.

SUMMARY: This was such a fun trip. An amazing combination of small towns (aka diner meals), history (yes we stopped to read almost every placard), and nature (we stopped counting turtles on the C&O after we got to infinity). LOVED that this was car-free for 300+ miles. The fact that it was flat made it easy for my sister (who has never done a bike tour, but rides her city cruiser with hilariously precarious errand loads) to jump in with almost no preparation. 10/10 would recommend to just about anyone. Truly a national treasure. We even wrote up a potential itinerary with all of our favorite spots marked for our parents to ride it someday--they'd be staying in accommodations and our dad would be on an e-bike.

I did not go to high school or university here, and this place is primarily a college town so it's been tough to find ways to make friends.

I feel like I am not someone who makes friends easily or naturally. My tried and true method has been to first befriend an extrovert who introduces me to other people I can become friends with. This is a lot harder when I no longer have school or other shared environments to rely on to befriend an extrovert. 

I don't have much time or money to invest in hobbies but I have started routinely going to the gym. My gym also offers group pilates and yoga classes which I have been going to for a few months. Most of the classes I go to are taught by an instructor who is around my age, who I thought I could connect with outside of class. (We usually make small talk after the classes wrap up.) After a class last weekend, I plucked up the courage to ask, ""I'm not sure if it's against the gym's policy but do you want to get coffee sometime?"" She said yes and also said that the gym didn't have any policies like that, so I got her number to coordinate. I texted her saying hi and introducing myself, which she responded to, but I asked ""how's it going"" and since then, no response, although I have been to one of her pilates classes since which makes it a little awkward. Her interactions with me have not changed which also kind of confuses me. 

I'm not sure what to do here. Do I just let it go? Do I follow up after one of her classes or over text? How can I be ""better"" at making new friends in the future? 

I'm overthinking this but I guess I'm just feeling a little bruised because I don't put myself out there that often and I was quite excited about making a new friend, so the ghosting sort of hurts.",1,1750955838.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

According to the article, one of the ""cons"" is potential cell structure damage. As it says: the freezing and thawing process can cause damage to the cellular structure of coffee beans. This can lead to a loss of essential oils, which are crucial for the coffee's flavor and aroma.""

It goes on to say:

>Many coffee experts recommend avoiding the freezer and instead suggest storing coffee in a cool, dark place. According to the National Coffee Association, the best way to store coffee is in an airtight container at room temperature.

Hey there, friends! 🌟

So let’s dive into a little daydreaming—imagine waking up and instead of jumping through hoops for some morning commute, you’re enjoying a cup of coffee while painting, gardening, or dabbling in your latest passion project. Sounds dreamy, right? But here’s the kicker: what if you could actually make some extra cash while pursuing those hobbies? Or, gasp, what if you just enjoyed them without the pressure to earn a dime? 😱

The truth is, retirement doesn’t have to be the end of your hustle; it can be a fresh start. Let’s explore how to turn those passions into income (or not) and embrace that freedom that truly **empowers us to choose how we live as we age**.

Here are some ideas to spark your creativity:

1. **Find Your Sweet Spot**: 
   - Look at what you genuinely love to do. Is it knitting, gardening, photography, or writing? Your passions are your goldmine!
   - *Tip*: Ask yourself, “What do I love so much that I often lose track of time?”

2. **Monetize or Just Enjoy?**:
   - **Monetize**: Maybe you could sell handmade crafts on Etsy, start a blog, or even host workshops! 
   - **Just Enjoy**: On the flip side, maybe you don't need to turn it into a business. How liberating is that? Sometimes, doing it just for fun is where the magic lies. 

3. **Community Connection**:
   - Share your interests with like-minded folks! Join local clubs or online forums. You never know who might be interested in your skills or who can open doors for you. Plus, friends make the journey a lot more fun! 
   - Remember, it’s not all about earning—sometimes it’s about the connections we make.

4. **Test the Waters**: 
   - Not sure if your hobby can become a side gig? Start small!
   - Offer to do a few projects for friends or family. This is a great way to test your skills without a full commitment. You might just discover you’re a natural at selling your paintings!

5. **Embrace the Learning Curve**:
   - Don’t be afraid of making mistakes! Every artist, entrepreneur, or straight-up hobbyist has faced challenges. *Think of them as stepping stones—sometimes, you learn more from the stumbles than the straight paths!*

And let’s not forget the joy it brings.💖 Imagine being able to create something beautiful and share it with the world. The peace that comes from singing your favorite songs, tending to your plants, or crafting something beautiful? Priceless!

1ll4ow5,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1ll4ow5/guy_at_restaurant_tries_to_barter_the_price_of/,Guy at restaurant tries to barter the price of toast,"This happened to me in college a few years ago but I was just thinking about it when talking to a friend.

I worked at a brunch restaurant that was pretty…not like expensive, but good quality. They made a lot of things in-house and also bought their bread and biscuits from a local bakery down the street. Very local prioritized place and not a chain. 

Anyways, an older guy—maybe 50 or so—comes in and sits at the bar. Orders a drink and starts looking at the menu.

When I go back to check on him and take his order he confirms the price of a la carte toast and jam. It’s $1.50 as it says on the menu.

He starts lecturing me: “You know, most businesses lower the cost when customers by in bulk…” He just explained buying in bulk and gave some like construction supplies examples for like a full 2 minutes and I’m just nodding wondering where this is going.

So he finally concludes, “So if I buy four orders of toast and jam I should be able to pay $3.”

I apologize and tell him we don’t have any type of deal like that and 4 orders would still be $1.50 each. 

He then tells me I’m bad at business and don’t know how to make deals and that I need to price competitively to keep customers. Like I’m the owner of the restaurant setting prices.

I just shrug, smile, and apologize again and ask if he still wants the 4 orders of toast. He says no since the pricing isn’t good and says he’ll just have one order.

Luckily I never had to deal with him paying the check, because I bet he tried to debate that too. He sat at the bar so long drinking from the self serve coffee bar that my shift ended before he left. 

People really do come into restaurants and try to bargain prices haha. He acted like I was an idiot the whole time for not understanding “bulk pricing.” ",37,1750955511.0,EntitledPeople,10,0.95,False

Nope. It’s ‘cause I somehow landed myself a boyfriiiend. Like, what? Me? Scarlett, the girl who spends more time with her vibrator than actual humans? Crazy.

His name’s Alex. Tall, messy dark hair, glasses—total anime protagonist vibes, but like… if the protagonist was kinda nerdy and blushed every time I teased him. We’re in the same dorm, and I swear, the way he looks at me when I’m in my tiny sleep shorts? Adorable. Like he’s trying so hard not to stare. (Spoiler: he fails.)

I don’t even know how we started talking. Probably me being my usual nosy self, asking what game he was playing on his laptop. But now? Now he brings me coffee when I’m dead-eyed at 3 AM debugging garbage code. He listens to me rant about shitty anime plots. And—god, this is the best part—he lets me doodle dumb little tattoos on his arm with my markers. (He kept the last one for three days. Cute.)

But here’s the thing. I know he wants to kiss me. Like, badly. The way he fumbles his words when I lean too close, how his eyes drop to my lips when I bite them… Ugh. But he’s too sweet to make a move. So guess who’s gotta take charge? Sigh. Boys.

September 24th, 2015

IT HAPPENED. Sort of.

I was half-asleep, tangled in my sheets, when my phone buzzed. 2:30 AM. Alex’s name flashing like a damn neon sign. I answered, voice all groggy, and he’s like, “Scarlett, s-sorry, but—can you come get me? I’m at Caverns.”

Now, Caverns is this grimy club where first-years go to pretend they’re cool. And Alex? Alex doesn’t go to clubs. So obviously, I threw on the first thing I found (a crop top and shorts that barely cover my ass—fight me), grabbed my keys, and went.

When I got there, he was outside, swaying a little, looking so out of place. His shirt was wrinkled, hair a mess, and his glasses were crooked. Adorable disaster. His friend Mark (who, btw, is way too handsy) was laughing at some shit, but Alex just lit up when he saw me.

“Y-you came,” he mumbled, all drunk and soft.

“Duh,” I said, rolling my eyes. “Get in, loser.”

The drive back was… interesting. Mark kept making dumb jokes, and Alex kept apologizing for bothering me. Like, babe, if I didn’t wanna be here, I wouldn’t be. Duh.

Then Mark goes, “Damn, Alex, you got your own personal chauffeur? And she’s hot.”

Alex went bright red. I smirked.

“Hell yeah he does,” I said, winking at Alex in the rearview. “Maybe I should make him pay me back, huh?”

Alex choked. Mark howled. And I? I was having way too much fun.

Dropped Mark off first (thank god), then drove Alex back to dorms. He was all wobbly, so I slung his arm over my shoulders. His breath was warm on my neck, and fuck, he smelled good—like cheap beer and his stupid citrusy cologne.

At his door, he fumbled with his keys, so I took them. “Hopeless,” I teased.

He looked at me, all big, guilty eyes. “S-sorry. You didn’t have to—”

I shut him up by pressing my lips to his. Just a quick, messy kiss—alcohol and all. Pulled back before he could even react.

“There. Now we’re even.”

His face? Priceless.

I left him standing there, mouth still open, and sauntered off.

1ll4gey,https://www.reddit.com/r/Husband/comments/1ll4gey/my_husband_please_dont_mind_me_ranting/,My husband (please don't mind me ranting),"Loving my husband comes as naturally to me as breathing. He is not just the man I married—he is my constant, my comfort, and my best friend. From the moment we met, I was drawn to his kind heart, his gentle demeanor, and the way he made everyone around him feel seen and valued. As our relationship has deepened over time, my admiration and love for him have only grown stronger.

His love is present in the small, quiet ways that matter most. It’s in the way he remembers the things I like, surprises me with coffee when I need a pick-me-up, or holds me when I’ve had a rough day. He doesn’t need grand gestures to show his love—his consistent presence, thoughtfulness, and emotional support speak volumes. He notices the details, the unspoken needs, and responds with care every time. It’s that attentiveness that makes me feel so deeply loved and understood.

There have been times when life has tested us—moments of stress, uncertainty, or sadness. In every one of those times, my husband has been my anchor. His calm presence reassures me, and his unwavering belief in us helps me find strength I didn’t know I had. He doesn't just support me; he uplifts me. He reminds me of my worth, encourages my dreams, and believes in me even when I doubt myself.

But it’s not only his kindness and care that make me love him—it’s who he is at 
Loving my husband is one of the most natural and fulfilling parts of my life. He’s not just my partner—he’s my home, my best friend, and the steady, loving presence that brings peace to every part of my world. What makes him even more special is the way he blends kindness and strength with his passions, especially his deep love for cowboys, miners, and good food. His interests may seem simple to some, but to me, they’re a beautiful reflection of who he is—loyal, hardworking, grounded, and full of life.

From the start, I was drawn to his caring nature. He has a gentle way of loving others that feels rare in this world. He listens with real attention, he supports without hesitation, and he shows up—again and again—for the people he loves. He doesn't just speak love; he lives it through actions, through small daily moments of thoughtfulness, and through his unwavering loyalty. But what makes my love for him even richer is seeing how his passions reflect the core of his personality.

My husband has a deep admiration for cowboys and miners—two groups of people who symbolize grit, resilience, and a respect for the land and hard work. He often shares stories or fun facts about the Old West, and I love listening to him speak with such excitement and reverence. Whether it’s the lone cowboy on the prairie shouting ""yee haw"" or ""howdy partner"" or the miner who dug deep into the earth to build a life growing out of his life of poverty and filth, he connects to their strength and purpose. It’s not just about history for him—it’s about values. He respects the kind of people who get up early, work with their hands, and do what needs to be done without complaint. And the truth is, he’s just like them in many ways.

Loving my husband means loving all of him—his generous heart, his steady presence, his appreciation for the past, and his appetite for life. He inspires me to slow down, to value what matters, and to see beauty in the simple things. Through his love of cowboys and miners, he teaches me about strength and honor. Through his love of food, he reminds me to savor the present. And through his love for me, he gives me a kind of peace and happiness I never knew I could have.

(PS2),"The Sims: 'Get a Life' mode would be perfect, have a separate world and just let newer sims players enjoy the very first real story mode sims ever had. 

Bustin' Out: While the story is better then Sims, it is a lot bigger and honestly could be just a entire port or remake. I think we could take loading screens from this game. which also would be go great with cars! You see in this game when you wanted to go to another lot, you would get in your car and the loading screen would be of you driving to said lot.

Urbz: God... I just want a full remake of this. If someone from EA or Sims team sees this please call me. I have so many ideas. But if I HAVE to pick something. I think the clothing. Like sure we have gotten some things like the goth kit and all that. but like The SIms 4 goth kit is like you went shopping at Hot Topic yesterday ya know? and then the gothic/punk clothing in Urbz? well you walked into that 90's death metal blasting barb wired everywhere Hot Topic. Urbz turns everything up to an 11, not like in a ""in your face"" way but just it's fun. god this game is so good.

Sims 2: Okay this one I have to cheat because there's a few things.  
1. Direct controls. WHY DO WE NOT HAVE THIS YET? Sims 2 you could fully control the sim but still could switch back if you didn't like it.  
  
2. Making food. You would go to fridge, you would have your cook book and you would have to select the ingredients. OR you could just throw stuff together and see what happens.  
  
3. CAS: again with the Direct Controls. this should be a base standard in every sims game. everything was separate. so you could pick a shirt, then a coat to go over it. You could toggle hair accessories on and off. 

The Sims 2; Pets: So you know how SIms 4 has a lot of food stands and stuff? well in the Sims 2 pets for consoles you could go to those places and the more you spent the more they would upgrade. for example, you had a small coffee stand. you spend lets say $2000 there. next time you went the stand would be bigger. and eventually it would be a small little shop. Something like that would be so amazing in SIms 4.

SIms Castaways: Yeah okay so. I guess they could just make this into a expansion pack since it is so different... like it doesn't really fit anywhere unless you pretend Sulani is is a island you got ship wrecked on. However then seeing like Judith might take you out of that experience. Honestly like Urbz. just make remake this game (be a lot funner without that dumb fire code shit the PS2 had to deal with. my god you couldn't build ANYTHING in this game) and hell maybe you can still have it connected to Sims 4. Like maybe you can bring a family over. Like you're playing with the Pancakes and you can bring them over to Castaways and have them ship wrecked on an island. then once you get done and they get rescued they can go back to sims 4 and they have memories of that happening.",0,1750954730.0,thesims,3,0.33,False
