Seen conflicting information in my research—I thought strength was the amount of coffee per puck, and body was the amount of water used. But then, there is a separate setting for volume of the shot? So something seems redundant. 

My current favorite drink we’ve made is a flat white with 50 mL espresso and 150 mL milk (the default recipe for the machine). But I’m thinking that single shot of espresso is too dilute at 50 mL? Other recipes have a volume of 40 mL.

Clearly, I’m missing something with how these variables all combine.",1,1733695699.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

We understand that everyone gets sick, but we also know there are people out there who get sick when it is convenient for them and don't care what their long weekend does to the rest of the team.

1h9u1zi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h9u1zi/aitah_for_cutting_off_a_maga_friend_after_their/,AITAH for cutting off a MAGA friend after their beliefs got increasingly fascist and far-right?,"So. I’ve been friends with this guy named Mark for a few years now. We used to hang out a lot. Talk about sports. Random stuff. Just enjoy each other’s company. I wouldn’t say we were super close. But we were good friends.

Over the past few months. though. things started getting… weird. At first. it was just the usual complaints about the government. politics. and how everything was falling apart. I didn’t agree with everything. but I didn’t think much of it. he was just venting. right? But then it started escalating.

One night. I went over to his place to watch a game. and when I walked in. he had this huge stack of papers on his coffee table. like. at least 200 pages. I asked what it was. and he started going off about how “the truth about the government” had been hidden for decades. He told me that the government wasn’t just corrupt. but actually controlled by a secret cabal of wealthy elites who were using “brainwashing technology” to make people vote the way they wanted. He was so serious about it. Like. I thought he was messing around. but no. he was dead serious.

The next time I saw him. he started talking about how “MAGA is the only thing that can save America” because “the elites are trying to turn everyone into mindless drones.” He claimed that social media and TV were “weapons of mass hypnosis” and that people who didn’t agree with him were basically already brainwashed. I laughed at first. but he wasn’t joking. He genuinely believed this.

It didn’t stop there. He told me that the entire education system was part of this “deep state plot” to make sure people were “dumb enough to fall for the lies.” He said schools were actually teaching kids how to “obediently follow orders.” like some sort of massive cult. And then—this is the part that really got me—he said that the Democrats were planning to “turn the country into a socialist utopia where everyone gets free government-issued chips in their brains to track their every move.” He was literally telling me that the government was trying to implant chips in people’s brains to control them. and that “MAGA was the last stand to prevent us from becoming zombies.”

I tried to laugh it off. but he kept doubling down. sending me links to articles from websites I couldn’t even find again if I tried. They were all about how the “mainstream media” was brainwashing people into “believing the government isn’t evil.” He said things like. “You don’t understand. you’re part of the system now. you’re helping them control us.” At this point. I was just sitting there in silence. wondering how we went from talking about sports to me being accused of helping to “destroy the country.”

Then it got personal. He started saying that “anyone who doesn’t believe the MAGA message is a pawn of the globalist agenda.” and that if I didn’t get on board. I was “part of the problem.” He even told me that he was “worried for my safety” because “once the brain chip plan goes into effect. anyone who disagrees with the government will be sent to re-education camps.” I mean… re-education camps? WTF? It was like a total meltdown.

I tried to tell him that I didn’t want to talk about this stuff anymore. I said. “You’re entitled to your views. but I just can’t keep going down this path with you.” He told me I was “weak” and “brainwashed.” and that I’d “regret this when the truth comes out.” At that point. I just couldn’t handle it anymore. so I stopped responding to his messages. He’s texted me a few more times. but I just haven’t replied.

Oh. and I should mention that he’s really into Fox News. I don’t know if that has anything to do with it. but he’ll reference it every chance he gets like it’s the gospel. It’s a bit much sometimes.

Now. mutual friends are telling me I’m being too harsh. that I should “let him be passionate” and “let him vent.” But honestly. I’m kind of terrified of what he’s becoming. I don’t even know how to talk to him anymore. AITAH for cutting him off? Should I have stuck around to try to talk some sense into him. or did I do the right thing?",0,1733695273.0,AITAH,2,0.5,False

I’ll admit, it all started with good intentions. I (not saying/ mature / veteran / scientician)  wasn’t supposed to be at the party; I was on my way to the park for some alone time with my book and a thermos of coffee. But then I saw the balloons—dozens of them—tied to the fence of a house on Chutney Street. They were brightly colored, festive, and entirely too cheerful for a day like this. Naturally, I decided to investigate.

The door was wide open, so I walked right in. No one noticed me at first, which I thought was their first mistake. I mean, who throws a birthday party and doesn’t secure the perimeter? The house was packed: kids running around with cake smeared on their faces, adults chatting loudly over the music, and a clown twisting balloons in the corner. The whole scene screamed chaos.

“Whose party is this?” I asked a woman holding a tray of snacks.

“It’s Lily’s!” she said, smiling. “She’s turning six.”

Ah, a child’s birthday party. That explained the screaming. But then I caught sight of something truly horrifying: the cake. It was a towering monstrosity covered in pink frosting and glitter, shaped like a unicorn. But here’s the thing—it had candles on it.

Now, I don’t know if you’ve ever thought about this, but open flames in a room full of helium balloons and small children are a recipe for disaster. I knew I had to act fast.

I marched straight to the cake, grabbed a bottle of water from a nearby table, and poured it over the candles just as the birthday girl approached. She burst into tears. Everyone gasped.

“What are you doing?!” someone shouted.

“I’m saving your lives!” I shouted back. “Do you have any idea how flammable helium is?”

A man, probably Lily’s dad, stepped forward, his face red with anger. “Helium isn’t flammable, you lunatic!”

“That’s exactly what they want you to think,” I retorted. “Ever heard of a controlled narrative? Big Balloon doesn’t want you to know the truth.”

The crowd was getting hostile, so I decided to switch tactics. “Look,” I said, “I’m not the villain here. Do you know what could have happened if I hadn’t intervened? That clown over there? He’s standing way too close to the grill. One spark, and boom! You’re all toast.”

The clown looked up, startled, and accidentally let go of a balloon animal, which floated into a ceiling fan and popped loudly. Everyone screamed. I took this as an opportunity to usher the kids outside, declaring, “Evacuation drill! Go, go, go!”

The parents followed reluctantly, muttering something about calling the cops. Once everyone was safely on the lawn, I climbed onto a picnic table and addressed the crowd.

“You’re welcome,” I said. “Today, I saved you all from certain doom. There’s no need to thank me, but I wouldn’t say no to a slice of cake.”

The cops did arrive eventually. I explained the situation to them with remarkable clarity, but they seemed more concerned with the fact that I wasn’t invited to the party in the first place. As they escorted me to the squad car, I yelled back at the partygoers, “You’ll thank me when you’re older! Heroism is a thankless job!”

As the car pulled away, I saw the clown light a cigarette near the grill. The balloons wavered in the breeze, and the kids had stopped crying. They’d be safe—for now.

And that’s how I saved a six-year-old’s birthday party from inevitable catastrophe. You’re welcome, world.

From the way she bangs on about it, you'd imagine they usually wipe their chocolate starfish all over her order.

Am I a bad person because of neutrality?

I’ve been reflecting a lot lately, and I need some outside perspectives. Throughout my life, I’ve always refrained from giving strong opinions about myself. I wouldn’t help others, but I wouldn’t seek to undermine them either.

As an analogy, if I saw a lost child, I wouldn’t help to avoid looking like a creep, but I wouldn’t actively avoid the situation either.

To elaborate on that, I live in the most self-sustainable way I can to protect myself as a modern man in today’s society. I’m courteous and polite, but never out of affection or hypocrisy. I avoid having strong opinions, belonging to any group, or forming any bonds or friendships. I avoid authentic haircuts or clothing brands that would give me uniqueness. I indulge in the most basic hobbies—not out of love, but out of necessity to fit the bare minimum to be seen as an interesting enough person and maintain some degree of escape for mundane conversations between coworkers. Needless to say, I seek no raises or promotions; I simply do barely enough not to be terrible or stand out particularly on either side of the good or bad spectrum.

If I were forced to partake in a conversation, I give the most politically strategic answer, without siding with any particular viewpoint, regardless of the values or atrocities involved—be it participating in the fight for freedom, Nazism, freeing Black people, terrorism, police brutality, or any other subject—leaving a bitter taste in everybody’s mouth.

As for my beliefs, I’ve always thought of life as unique in a way that I can choose my very own goal and be justified in not participating in the fight for anything in particular. I am an organism that just wants to float through life, deciding for myself what’s important. I don’t like being bothered; I would consider my coffee time more important than solving some genocide somewhere in the world, for example. I wouldn’t advocate for it.

This could involve various things that don’t include serving others, fighting societal battles, or contributing significantly to society. Does that correlate to me being a bad person? Or am I just not a useful one?

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Edit: Before you ask, I am not a sociopath and don’t think I could be. (Please do not let that affect your judgment.) I’m seeking honest answers for feedback and self-evaluation purposes. Serious answers only.",2,1733694489.0,findapath,2,1.0,False

I used to start my day scrolling through my phone, and surprise—it ruined my focus. Now, I have a 10-minute morning ritual that sets the tone for the day.

Here’s what I do:  
1️⃣ **No phone for the first 30 minutes.** Instead, I journal or read something inspiring.  
2️⃣ **Set daily intentions:** I write down one thing I *must* accomplish.  
3️⃣ **Move my body:** A 5-minute stretch or walk clears the mental cobwebs.  
4️⃣ **Hydrate:** A glass of water before coffee works wonders.

Starting small helped me make it stick. Now my mornings feel purposeful, not chaotic.

1h9tpn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeHive/comments/1h9tpn7/wall_microwave_oven_the_compact_solution_that/,Wall Microwave Oven: The Compact Solution That Works for Me,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share my experience with wall microwave ovens since I recently made the switch and it's been a game-changer for my kitchen setup. I know a lot of you might be dealing with limited counter space or just wanting to upgrade your kitchen's look, so I thought this might help.

I used to have one of those bulky countertop microwaves that took up way too much space. After doing tons of research and actually using a wall microwave oven for the past few months, I can't believe I didn't make this change sooner.

First off, the space-saving aspect is incredible. Moving my microwave off the counter opened up so much prep area - I can actually lay out all my ingredients when cooking now! Plus, the built-in look is sleek and modern, making my kitchen look way more expensive than it actually is.

The installation process wasn't as scary as I thought it would be. I hired a professional (definitely recommend this route unless you're super handy), and it was done in a couple of hours. The unit fits perfectly into the wall cabinet space, and the ventilation system works better than my old countertop model.

One thing that surprised me was how much more efficient these built-in units are. My new wall microwave oven heats food more evenly, and I've noticed it uses less energy than my old one. The controls are at eye level, which makes it easier to use, and most models come with better features than standard countertop units.

If you're considering making the switch, I found some great options here: https://athometouch.com/wallovens. They have different sizes and styles to fit various kitchen layouts and budgets. I spent hours comparing models, and this really helped me narrow down my choices.

Some practical tips from my experience:
- Measure your space carefully (twice!)
- Consider the power output you need
- Look for models with good warranties
- Check if your kitchen's electrical setup can handle it
- Think about features you'll actually use (I love the sensor cooking option)

The price point might seem higher than countertop models, but think about it as an investment in your home. It adds value to your kitchen and makes the whole space more functional. Plus, the quality tends to be better since these are designed for long-term installation.

I'm not trying to oversell it - there are some considerations like making sure you have the right wall space and proper electrical setup. But if you're tired of losing counter space or want to upgrade your kitchen's look, a wall microwave oven might be worth considering.

Anyone else here made the switch? I'd love to hear about your experiences or answer any questions about mine.

P.S. Don't forget to check the dimensions of your favorite coffee mug - make sure it fits comfortably in whichever model you choose! Learned that one the hard way...",1,1733694339.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

1h9tlmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsReadOfficial/comments/1h9tlmb/these_creepy_ass_burbs_man/,These Creepy Ass Burbs Man,"After our first child was born, my husband, Mike, and I decided to move out of the bustling downtown area and settle into the Georgia Suburbs. We found a house in a brand-new development—so new it wasn’t even on Google Maps yet. 

It felt like a milestone, a fresh start.

Our baby girl, Miley, was about nine months old at the time. While Mike was at work, I’d clean during her naps so we could enjoy some family time in the evenings. This routine left the kitchen as my last chore of the day, and, every night before bed, I’d wipe down the table, push in the chairs, and leave everything spotless. Call it homeowner pride or a sprinkle of OCD—either way, the kitchen had to be just right or I couldn’t sleep well.

So, imagine my surprise when one morning I found the kitchen table and chairs shoved against the wall next to the back door.

Mike had already left for work and was on the road still when I called him to ask what on earth he was doing rearranging furniture in the dead of night.

He swore up and down that he hadn’t touched the dining set. At first, I thought he was messing with me, but his exasperation finally convinced me. As for me? I swear on the grave of my ancestors I didn’t move them.

I soon chalked the experience up to sleep-deprived clumsiness. Maybe I bumped the furniture when taking out the trash? Funny how quickly we rationalize the inexplicable to feel sane.

But things didn’t stop there.

Months later, just after Mike had left for work, I woke to an awful chirping sound. It was so loud it seemed to fill the entire house. Groggy but alarmed, I stumbled into the kitchen to find the source: a little toy chick Miley adored.

This toy only chirped when its sensors touched skin, yet here it was, singing its heart out in the middle of the kitchen floor. I distinctly remembered leaving it on Miley’s high chair the night before.

When I told Mike, he brushed it off. ""Bad batteries,"" he said, not even looking up from his coffee. Mike, was a bit of a skeptic. I can be too, but I also believe that there are things that can happen, maybe even scientific in nature, that we simply do not have explanations for–yet.

Besides, even if the batteries were dying, why did it chirp only after Mike left? Did the house’s energy have a thing for dramatic timing?

Then came the incident that still makes the hair on my body rise to this very day.

I was pregnant with our second child and had just reconnected with my estranged mother, who had a history of paranoid schizophrenia. She reached out to me on Myspace (yes, Myspace), and we made plans for her to visit for the holidays.

A week before her arrival, she called me, saying she'd dreamed of being visited by all her deceased relatives. I dismissed it as one of her delusions, however, that same night, I had a vivid dream that she died and I was summoned to her funeral in Texas.

The next day, I got the call: she’d been killed in a hit-and-run accident.

We traveled to Texas for the funeral and brought back a few of her belongings, including a walking stick she’d made and a diary. I opened her diary and made a chilling discovery: her last entry asked God to let her see her “lost babies” one last time.

The day after we returned, Mike and I were both working from home when we both heard it: a child’s voice, clear as day, saying “Mama.”

It wasn’t Miley. She was napping upstairs.

I followed the sound to the kitchen, where one of those creepy dolls—the kind no sane person would give a child but for some reason, her paternal grandparents did—was perched on the counter. Anabelle had nothing on this creepy ass doll! I kept it locked away in a toy box and had all but forgotten about it.

But there it was, as happy as you please.  And naked.

Why was it naked? How did it get here?

I picked it up, shook it, pressed its buttons—nothing. It just stared at me with those dead, glassy eyes as if mocking me.

To this day, Mike refuses to talk about it.

Years passed, and my kids grew up. The house has mostly quieted down, but something strange happens every so often, like the bathroom light turning on by itself after a friend’s sudden passing.

Faulty wiring? Maybe. But my rescue cats seem to think otherwise. There are nights I wake up to find all of them sitting in creepy unison, staring at some unseen entity in the corner.

I like to think the house isn't evil, just… quirky. And while I can't explain everything that's happened, I've learned to coexist with the weirdness. After all, there are mysteries we're probably not meant to solve—at least not while we’re still among the living.",1,1733694033.0,LetsReadOfficial,0,1.0,False

for starters: i’m diagnosed with ADHD, OCD, anxiety, binge eating disorder, and depression. have had difficulty losing weight since age 16. had been binging for roughly 2 years, started treatment in august and got it under control. i just don’t want any “eat less move more” comments because i HAVE. i just gain weight slower instead of rapidly. 

but yeah. i’ve gained at least 40 lbs since january, and i was already 5’0” and 165-170 then. i just weighed in at 211 at my last doctor’s visit but it fluctuates up to 219. i keep gaining weight. i have an active job and i’m not gorging myself. my portions are appropriate. i’ve worked with a nutritionist for months. we don’t understand why i keep gaining nonstop. it’s been really hard psychologically but that’s not what i’m here for rn. 

i take lexapro, concerta, combination birth control, clonidine for sleep, buspar for anxiety, and auvelity (wellbutrin combo) as a secondary antidepressant. i think i might have PCOS but i’ve been on birth control for 3 years, so hard to tell. the reason i went on it is because my period cramps used to be so painful i would have to lay down somewhere, and i would fade in/out of consciousness just sweating profusely. they completely incapacitated me. both aunts have had ovarian cysts, and eventually full hysterectomies as a result. obesity runs all on my mother’s side. vitamin-wise, i take magnesium glycinate, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin B12, and zinc. 

starting in september, i’ve also been having these episodes of de realization where i feel i’m watching my life through a movie screen/nothing is real. i had not gone through any medication or lifestyle changes to trigger it. i was so out of it me day that month, i even damaged my car on a pole trying to park at a gas station.

no amount of sleep feels like enough, whether it’s 6 hours or 15. i find it impossible to fall asleep in less than an hour, so i take sleep meds for those with ADHD and have been since july 2023. it’s helped a lot, and i sleep deeply according to my apple watch, but i’m always exhausted. i’ll feel fine for two hours, and then this wave of exhaustion just hits me like a train and i have to fight to stay awake. doesn’t matter if i’m at work, school, driving, or at home. i make careless mistakes at work and on school projects that should be easy. i’m no longer depressed all the time with the help of my medication (minus the fact that all of this is pretty upsetting). i find it impossible to take naps because i sleep through every single alarm. to wake up for work (i work at a coffee shop so often 4:30 or 5:00 AM), i’ve had to get an alarm that shakes my bed. 

it started slow, with two or three “episodes” a week, but now it’s every day. most of the time it lasts all day, too. caffeine doesn’t help, no matter how long i detox from it for. my psychiatrist and another physician she works with evaluated and agree that none of this would be due to my meds, since i’ve been on the same combination for two years (minus the auvelity, but that doesn’t even carry these side effects).

i went to a gyno because i’ve never been to one (i know, i know), and tried to pick someone who had lots of positive reviews, especially in the realm of “this doctor believed me”. i told her what i suspect, my family history, my symptoms, how long they’ve been lasting, etc. she ordered a few labs but i feel like something’s missing. should she have done more? she ordered TSH, CBC, ferritin, and A1C/blood glucose. i will put images of all of my results in the comments. either way, my results are all well within normal ranges except for:

1. my red blood cell count— it is actually a bit high, not outside of the normal range but it’s pretty close (5.04 M/mcL)

2. my ferritin— ideal levels sit around 100 ng/mL from my understanding, but mine are 17. this is alarming. i eat lots of iron-rich foods and vitamin C aids in the absorption of iron. if i were bleeding too heavily on my period, would i not also be anemic? i’m not though!!! this definitely explain the fatigues and derealization, but… why is it so LOW?

my A1C is a little high-normal, but none of this explains the insane weight gain. even binging, i gained probably 5-10 lbs a year. 40????????? there was one month where i gained 10 lbs without changing a thing about my diet or exercise. notably, my insurance had been giving me the runaround that month because it wanted me to start using a mail-order pharmacy, but it was insanely hard for no reason. as a result, there were huge delays, and i wasn’t on birth control for that entire month (i am gay, so pregnancy is not a factor i have to worry about). that surely must have something to do with it. 

i know that’s a terribly large amount of information, but i need help. i am running out of places to turn. my grades are starting to slip and i barely have the energy to shower or hang out with friends anymore. i feel like i’m crazy. when i look in the mirror, it doesn’t even look like the same person i picture in my head anymore. i don’t recognize myself. 

i have an endocrinology appointment at U of M in january, but until then, i am on my own, basically. i just want my life back, as sad as that sounds. thank you for reading this absolute essay. any input is greatly appreciated, and i am very thankful :)",1,1733693861.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

1h9t49m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1h9t49m/trent_horn_and_youtuber_tmm_on_free_will/,Trent Horn and Youtuber TMM on Free Will. ,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P8\_QfOuayQ&ab\_channel=TMM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5P8_QfOuayQ&ab_channel=TMM)

Why do atheists need determinism? Is it because when things are all determined from the beginning, a wrench is suddenly thrown into Christian biblical theology?

Free will and determinism. I feel like these are just symantics, different perspectives on the same outcomes. Somebody wants to say I have free will to choose X, while someone will say NO it was already determined for you to choose X.  And yet, whether or not it was already determind, or it was my free will, the outcome is the same. 

In the following video, ""Free Will Is Not Necessary for Morality"" by youtuber TMM

Trent says, ""what I am more concerned about in today's episode is reconciling many atheists's disgust towards christians who defend that doctrine, or the doctrine of hell, or the wrongness of homosexuality. Their disgust toward christians defending what they consider indefensible, and those same atheists denying we have free will.""

TMM responds, ""There's no tension between the idea that some acts are morally repugnant to us, and the idea that we have no free will. Quite the opposite. I act to deter or disincentivize acts that are intolerable to my conscience precisely because I believe that deterance and disincentives have at least some deterministic consequence with respect to people's behaviour. If I did not believe in determinism at all, there would be no point in trying to deter or disincentivize any behaviour, because if our wills are actually free, if they are not to any degree caused or determined, then deterrances and disincentives would be of absolutely no consequence. Trent would like you to believe that blame makes no sense if we don't have free will, but in reality the exact opposite is the case.""



Conclusion

If everything we do, every gesture, thought, decision, or the way you annoyingly slurp your coffee, what's the difference between that and referring to it as my own free will? The following quotation was striking, ""If I did not believe in determinism at all, there would be no point in trying to deter or disincentivize any behaviour, because if our wills are actually free, if they are not to any degree caused or determined, then deterrances and disincentives would be of absolutely no consequence."" How exactly did TMM conclude that? If he did not believe in determinism we would still need deterrants in society in order to prevent people from choosing to break the law, or perform immoral acts, because we can also use our free will to do wrong against others as well. 

Perhaps there is someone here who is more familiar with this subject.

I'm onsite trying to setup 9 new switches (Cisco small business catalyst 1300) and I'm pre-configuring them an office before install (thank god) and im running into a big issue. i can connect the switches with DAC cables just fine, but when i switch to putting in the Fiber SFPs that they will be using, i cant get them to link with fiber patch cables.

This is the SFP we have (which the switch can see an recognize)

[https://www.amazon.com/Yonwide-Singlemode-Lc-Fiber-Options/dp/B0CKSD13FL](https://www.amazon.com/Yonwide-Singlemode-Lc-Fiber-Options/dp/B0CKSD13FL)

they are both 1310nm and as far as i can tell they should work just fine. but I've only gotten 1-2 links up and its hit n miss, eg when i unplug a link that works, i might not come back up. I've tried shuffling them around in the ports, loopback fiber cable shows that the SFPs are good, and we've already tested the SFP ports on the switch with dac cables. i thought i might've been a length issue so i put a 100ft cable in between and still same results.

At one point i factory defaulted 3 of the switches just to see if it was a config issue, that didnt yield any different results. (which i didnt think it would because it all works with DAC cables)

A girl moves to florida since her dad lives out there. He has a girlfriend but never told his daughter or ex-wife so when the daughter arrives she meets her dads new girlfriend. She adjusts to the life in Florida and gets a job at a coffee shop. The crew welcomes her and they think she is another girl who was supposed to be hired but turns out that girl wasn’t hired. One of the workers gave the new girl a horse necklace since she thought the new girl was supposed to be that other new hire and apparently that other new hire LOVED horses. The new girl decided to accept the gift in confusion but played on as that horse loving girl.

In another book (I think) she went somewhere with a group of friends OR her dad and his new girlfriend and she went to the bathroom to frehsen up. She ended up trying to flip her head over to fix her hair like how she saw another girl she knew do but when she tried to flip her head back over she hit her head on the sink and passed out. Her father and his gf found her.

We met at 2 and went to a coffee shop, and stayed in there until 5 when the coffee shop closed. 

Then she said she had two hours until she had to meet her mum, so we walked around town talking for another 2 hours until she had to leave.

She did like 70% of the talking, and was really easy to talk to, but we didn't really break the touch barrier, she said she doesn't really like being touched and neither do I really so nothing happened in that regard.

As I left I told her to let me know she got home safe. Was wondering if I should text her saying I had a really good time and asking if she would like to go out with me again? Or if I should wait for her to text me first?

I'm wondering if its SIFO now? or candida? I really dont understand the difference lol 

I have no issues with FODMAPS or anything, its honestly just dairy, sugar and any junk really. For example, i use unsweetened almond milk at home in my coffee, if i order one from a cafe its sweetened with their almond milk and i just feel crap because of the sugar.

""This is a pretty hard story to tell, but it happened so I will tell it anyways. I don't even know where to start - okay here it goes. It all started when I was on a forum called toolian something or the other about the same thing, Rosetta Stoned song meaning and lyrics. We all had our own thoughts, ideas etcetera. I was talking about how it reffered to the learning languages series (Rosetta Stone). It makes sense, because if a person would want to ""write it down for all the world to see"" that person would need to know all languages plus 

Maynard has a sense of humor like that at times. At any rate, there was one line in the song that bothered me, I don't know why. ""Like the time dave floated away"". I wanted to know where that came from and everyone had their own ideas, Dave was Maynard's friend or a guy he got his DMT from and etc etc. Meanwhile my now ex gf had rented 2001: A Space Odyssey which was sitting on the coffee table since I joined that forum. She kept begging me to watch it and I didn't show any interest. Space movies really aren't my cup o tea. After about 3 days on that forum I finally decided to watch it with her. Now from the time I started this film to the end is where a transition happened in my life which I can't possibly even begin to describe using words, or actions. But I'll try. 

The entire movie I was thinking about Rosetta Stoned and to make it worse, whenever the computer HAL-9000 said ""Dave"" (the main characters name) I immediately thought of that song! I actually said something to her after an hour or so into the movie and she replied back ""what song? wtf are you talking about?"" well at any rate, I tried to put it aside, the song that is and enjoy the film. ""Dave"" this and ""Dave"" that - I was desperately looking for something now to MAKE this film FIT with that song! 

I was trying to grab anything I could see and turn it into a connotation or a parable of sorts, and nothing seemed to fit. It wasn't about this Dave. There was no ""floating"" or anything that resembled the experience from the lyrics in Rosetta Stoned. Until the end, Dave slips through a wormhole and the colors were amazing, as soon as I saw this I had goosebumps. This was it! This HAS to be what Maynard was talking about there is NO doubt in my mind! I was in shock. There was no way, I imagined that scene, I was speechless. 

When the movie was over I literally jumped off the couch to the computer and typed in google ""Rosetta Stoned 2001: A Space Odyssey"" and to my amazement, there are references to that song with that movie linked as well as Right in Two! I was fucking freaking out, ran outside to tell the ex brought her in and she was apathetic. It was like the excited kid telling his mom about the cool and rare insect he found, but she didn't care and I was and still am freaked out about that. That was in March of 2008.  
  
I'll never forget that and to this day, 2001 is my all time favorite movie. Yes because of that and it was actually really really good! ;)  
  
Just thought I'd share this with everyone.""

**Clan Code:** y5k7y
**Our Average Damage:** 170M, *Top 25 hitters:* **220M**
**Discord Contacts:** Gondulf (h2\_myself), hordan9643, ayrisvashu

**Who We Are:**

Welcome to **Hay Happers**, where the sun always shines, the Titans always fall, and the laughs are as common as the kills. We’re a top-tier clan in Tap Titans 2, perpetually hanging out in the Master Tier, **ranked between 11th and 13th, and our clan's average damage is 170M per hit.** like clockwork (we're consistent, okay?). Will you be the member that pushes us into the glorious top 10? We are part of the prestigious [**Alpha Legion**](https://discord.gg/tt2) alliance, where competition is fierce, but camaraderie is fiercer. 🌟

Our clan is built on the principles of teamwork, fun, and a relentless pursuit of improvement. We're so data-driven, our raid bot makes Siri look like a pocket calculator. 📊 Speaking of raids, **our top 25 hitters average a whopping 210M damage per hit.** Not too shabby, eh? Our bot is so good at its job, it might as well be sentient (don’t worry, it only uses its powers for good). The bot tracks everything you do during raids, from what cards you roll to how much damage you dealt before you even know it yourself. It’s like having a personal assistant, minus the coffee runs.

**What We’re Looking For:**

We’re currently on the hunt for some fresh blood—err, *dedicated players*—to join our ranks. Here’s the deal:

* **Raid Level:** 800+ (1000+ preferred)
* **Total Card Levels:** 1250+ (1400+ preferred)
* **Necrobear Level:** 100+ preferred
* **Damage Expectations:** Consistent 6/6 hits per cycle (excluding Kill Cycle) and collection of all 6 daily morale.
* **Consistency:** We like our attacks like we like our coffee—strong, consistent, and absolutely necessary.

If you’ve got what it takes to hit the damage numbers we’re pulling (our top 15 hitters average 250m per hit, btw), you’ll fit right in. But don’t worry—if you’re still working your way up, we’re more than willing to help you get there as long as you’re putting in the effort.

**Why You’ll Love Us:**

* **Friendly Vibes:** We might be competitive, but we’re also friendly and understanding. But here's the real tea: we're all about that work-life-Tap Titans balance. Miss an attack? We won't send you to the titan timeout corner. Forget to collect morale? We'll only judge you a little (kidding!). 😉 Just don’t make it a habit, and we’ll get along fine.
* **Expert Knowledge:** Between our seasoned veterans and our all-seeing bot, you’ll have access to an ocean of knowledge that’ll help you optimize your gameplay.
* **Community:** Being part of Alpha Legion means you’ll get to hang out with some of the best TT2 players around. We’ve got a shared Discord, where we swap stories, strategies, and the occasional meme.
* **Data-Driven Raiding:** With our bot at the helm, our raids are efficient, strategic, and a little bit terrifying in their precision. We call out attacks on Discord, but don’t worry—it’s not the military. You only have to call hits that might cause overkill.

Here's a sneak peak at the fancy bot

*Processing img 58dy2i30poid1...*

**How to Join:**

Interested? We thought so. 🧐 To apply, join our Discord: https://discord.gg/tt2. Post screenshots of your player stats, raid stats, and recent raid damage in the ⁠applications channel, and ping Gondulf (h2\_myself) to get started.

We’re excited to see what you’ve got. Whether you’re a seasoned vet or an up-and-coming Titan slayer, Hay Happers is where you’ll find your new home.

**TL;DR:**  
Join Hay Happers, a top-tier Alpha Legion clan, for epic raids, friendly vibes, and a bot that’s smarter than all of us.

Near the beginning of my sophomore year of college, on my 20th birthday, my girlfriend of 3 years and I ended our toxic relationship due to me discovering that she had been cheating on me.

And then, just two months later, I started dating a girl that I thought I would be with forever. 

The college we went to was a little weird. We would go to a state sponsored community college for 2 years and earn our associates degree, and then we’d be able to move up to our main campus which was a major University that was also in the same state. If we did this program (2 years at the community college and 2 years at the university), then the state would cover most of our tuition.


Needless to say; just after my 20th birthday in October 2021 when my long term girlfriend and I broke up, it was rough living at home and commuting to a community college. More than anything I just wanted to fully immerse myself in the college lifestyle and forget about her, but that lifestyle didn’t exist outside of our “main campus”. I was living at home and driving to school just like I always had, it was a rough time.

But all that changed when I met this girl. We were in a history class together and really hit it off talking after class, she was so cool and funny to talk to, it was the most fun I’d had meeting someone new in such a long time. And she was so unbelievably beautiful, you wouldn’t believe it. The fact that she’d be seen talking to a guy like me was insane to me. I eventually got her number and we started texting a lot. When the semester was coming to and end we started going on study dates to local coffee shops so we could prepare for our finals. These study dates eventually turned into real dates and I was loving every second I spent with her. She officially became my girlfriend shortly after Christmas in 2021.

She was so perfect and everything about our relationship was wonderful, better than anything I could have ever imagined for myself. We went to the city together to go on romantic dates, and could spend cold winter nights just driving around and having deep conversations about life. We painted together a lot (one of her hobbies), and cuddled up at night to watch our horror shows together. We went to the mall together, we went to fancy restaurants together, we took cold walks on the beach together. I spent all my time at her house, which was in the same town as our community college and was also the capital of our state. 

For the first time in my life, and after two failed relationships before, I felt like I was truly in love. And I could tell that she was in love with me back. We made a pact to be with each other forever, we called each other our soul mates and we would talk all the time about what our future would look like. She was so nice to me and respected me like no one else ever had. And I loved her more than anything else in the world.

When the spring semester of my sophomore year started, we signed up for a lot of classes together and hung out together all the time. I was also able to score an internship with the state government, which was absolutely perfect because I have always been obsessed with politics and government, it was my major in college and more than anything I want to hold elected office some day and do my best to change things for the better. The office was also 5 minutes from her house and 10 minutes from our campus, so I was in this town all the time. I was over the moon. I had my dream job, my future career prospects seemed great, I was with the love of my life and only falling deeper in love every day, and I was acing all my classes.

Also around this time I decided to take up Shakespearean stage acting, I auditioned for and was cast in a Shakespeare show at a local theater in my home town, which was huge for me because I had never put myself out there like that.

June 2022 eventually came around and my girlfriend and I graduated from community college with our associates degrees. My internship came to a close, and I performed in my play, which sold out every night and went amazingly. Also around this time my girlfriend and I made plans to continue our studies at our university’s main campus. She would be moving into a dorm and I would be moving into a townhouse with my best friends from high school who were already up there. They were about 10 minutes apart.

I spent the summer of 2022 managing the campaign for a state senator who I had met through my internship with the state government. It was a grueling job that took up most of my time and he ended up losing, but he paid me well and I got a lot of valuable experience, definitely saw the hard side of politics that I would have to undertake if it was something I wanted to do.

As my junior year started, my girlfriend and I moved up to our main campus and our relationship grew even stronger. We were no longer living with our families so aside from when we were in class and when she was at work, we spend almost all of our time together going on dates or having sleepovers or just hanging out at each others places. It was so perfect and we felt like we were preparing for our marriage life when we would live together. Every day I kept falling deeper and deeper in love with this girl. We had such a profound connection and we knew everything about each other and were completely vulnerable together all the time. I was certain I had found my soul mate.

It was also so great getting to live with my friends and have people over to our house all the time. Every night if I wasn’t with my girlfriend, me and my friends were all partying at my place after hitting the bars.

On top of this I had always been pretty good at school and had saved a lot of money up, so life was going pretty well for me, I was the happiest I’d ever been in my life.

I even started in another Shakespeare play in spring of 2023, and began to earn some serious props as an actor.

In the summer of 2023, after my junior year,I was offered an internship with my dad’s company as a salesman.His company is a massive manufacturer in the restaurant industry and I would be charged with selling to end users. I did pretty well with it, ended up closing about 200k in business. This caught the attention of an affiliate company (a broker firm that worked closely with my dad’s company) and they offered me a full time job when I graduated with extremely generous pay. Obviously I accepted.

My senior year was essentially a repeat of my junior year. I starred in another Shakespeare production, I was living with my friends acing all my classes, I was with my girlfriend all the time.

But in a way it was even better. I had the security of a job offer after college and my girlfriend took a one year lease on a townhouse that was right next to mine, so I got to see her even more often.

Everything continued to be so perfect, until I graduated college with my bachelors degree. 

My girlfriend’s lease ended about a month before mine, so she moved back home immediately. I planned to do the same once my lease was up as I thought it would make more sense to work full time and save up for a house rather than renting. 

She changed pretty much immediately after we graduated.

We were a very normal couple, we enjoyed a healthy sex life and occasionally going to the bar together. We made crude jokes and laughed a lot about stupid shit, and we did a lot of stupid shit together.

She spent the last month of our relationship falling deeper and deeper and deeper into a religious rabbit hole until she was essentially a fundamentalist evangelical Christian. She had always been somewhat more religious than me, but not like this.

For context, I’m not a religious person at all.

The last month of our relationship consisted of one ongoing fight. I needed to convert and throw myself as deeply into religion as her and make Jesus the center of our relationship, or we would be done. I tried and tried and tried to compromise with her but ultimately I couldn’t lie about the person I was to appease someone else. We broken up mutually at the end of June, on our 2 and a half year anniversary.

I was completely devastated. But I didn’t have time to heal. I had started working full time just two weeks prior, and two weeks after our breakup I moved back home with family.

I was numb. I was upset about leaving college and moving out of the house I shared with my friends, but most of all I was completely fucking broken over the fact that the relationship I thought would last forever had ended. All I did was work, I threw myself into my job and started working constantly.

And I discovered that I don’t like my job.

I cover the entire metro area of the major city that I live 45 minutes away from. I have accounts all over here and I’m expected to be calling on them all day or doing admin work. It’s a lot of driving, a lot of sales, and a lot of soulless boring fucking work that I don’t enjoy doing. Don’t get me wrong, I’m extremely lucky. I couldn’t get paid this much bag my age anywhere else and I’m very grateful for that. But I don’t want to do sales; I don’t like it. I like government and politics, and that’s what I’ve wanted to do since I was 12.

I have some friends living in my hometown, and I see them as much as I can, but it’s hard to do much more than play video games together or go to a bar together for a few hours at a time when most of us are all working full time.

Furthermore, the girl I thought I would marry started seeing someone else (a youth pastor) right around my 23rd birthday. She meant everything to me and I was fucking replaced in 4 months.


I’m empty. Most days I go to work and come home and don’t do shit. I’ve started working out and I was cast to be in another play, but it’s not helping. I see my friends when I can, but it doesn’t help. I feel completely stuck.


It’s been 5 and a half months of dealing with this new reality. I have lost all hope and optimism I have for the future. I also had a falling out with all of my female friends, so the only people I talk to are my few close friends, my family, and my coworkers. And I only ever even see my coworkers like once every two weeks, I’m alone at work most of the time.

I truly don’t know where to go from here. I know I want to move out of this town as soon as possible, but it feels like all the happiness I once had was gone.

1h9scys,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstory/comments/1h9scys/the_terror_of_the_tahimini/,The Terror of the Tahimini,"Cirren shielded his eyes as he stepped out of his hastily pitched tent. Looking around, he found the small village vastly different during the day than it was at night. Kids chased each other around the small oasis while the adults finished their morning chores. In another hour or so, everyone would gather by the waters of the oasis to refresh themselves during the hottest part of the day. Coincidentally, that was when Cirren was supposed to tell his tale.
Years ago, Cirren had a run-in with a creature that all young children who lived in the Tahimini learned about while growing up. For most, it was a mythical tale they’d forget as they grew older. For others, it was a warning to never travel into the desert alone. Sometimes, for misbehaving kids, it became a cautionary tale of what would come for them if they continued acting out. For an unlucky few, like Cirren, the Terror was a creature of nightmares they wouldn’t soon forget. These few traveled between the nomadic villages, spreading their tales of terror and pointing adventurers foolish enough to hunt the Terror toward its last known location.
After a quick breakfast of bread and coffee, Cirren followed the rest of the village to the oasis. Settling on a blanket spread below the canopies that stretched between the trees, Cirren called out, “Gather round and hear the tale of my encounter with the Terror!” Most of the adults had heard his tale years ago, and even some of their children. Still, nearly the entire village gathered around him, lounging in the shade. Cirren looked over them, letting his eyes linger on the young children who had yet to hear any tales of the monster. Seeing that everyone was seated and he had their attention, Cirren began.
“The most terrifying day of my life was seven years ago, and it haunts me to this day…”

Cirren and Yvere had set out from one of the smaller villages early that morning, having been forced to stop there due to a sandstorm the night before. Yvere thought it was a good omen for their attempt to take out the Terror that day. He and Cirren had been tracking the beast for a few weeks, trying to find the wadir, a riverbed oasis that the Terror used as its lair.
Now, standing at the edge of the wadir, Cirren remarked, “Well, so much for the sandstorm slowing it down,” as they watched the creature wander around the wadir, clearing out the sand from the night before.
“It still helps us. Now it’s distracted, trying to clear out its hovel,” Yvere said.
Cirren eyed Yvere skeptically. “You said the same thing the last time we tried to kill this thing, and we barely escaped with our lives. If it wasn’t for those horses, we would’ve been its dinner.”
“Well, we lived, didn’t we? Now let’s end this once and for all. I think we should wait and ambush it right before midday. That way it’ll hopefully be tired from clearing sand all morning. Just remember—stick to the plan and watch the fangs.”
“I’m unlikely to forget. I still have the markings from that first ambush. My arm looks like it’s withering away with disease. Don’t do anything stupid, Yvere. I’ll signal when I’m in position.”
With that, Cirren started to edge around the wadir, careful to keep his movements small so as not to alert the Terror.
When he reached the opposite side, Cirren stopped to study the creature before signaling Yvere. The creature stood taller than two men and was a mix between a scorpion and a snake. Where the tail of a scorpion would be, a cobra’s body began. They knew from earlier ambush attempts that it was a resilient creature. Simply cutting off the cobra portion wouldn’t work; most of its anatomy was scorpion-like. Unfortunately, getting close enough to its front was tricky, especially when they had to contend with its pincers and a lightning-fast, venomous snake. On top of that, its shell-like carapace was nearly impossible to penetrate, so any strikes had to be precise. That was Yvere’s specialty—precision blade work. While Yvere tried to strike a killing blow, Cirren’s job was to distract the cobra and, if possible, disable the pincers.
Looking over the terrain, Cirren identified a deadfall that might prove useful: two large trees near the creature, one standing straight and the other leaning, tangled in its branches. If he could knock the fallen tree loose, it might fall on the creature, giving Yvere a head start. Deciding on a plan, Cirren called upon his connection to the land, forming a gust of wind. He directed it toward a pile of loose leaves, letting them swirl for a moment before dropping the wind. This was the signal for Yvere to wait until after Cirren made his move. If Cirren had caused a minor sand devil instead, the ambush would have started on Yvere’s action.
Yvere waved in acknowledgment and crouched, preparing for the inevitable. Watching the creature’s movements and judging the force needed to topple the trees, Cirren let loose an extra-strong gust of wind. Moments later, they both heard the creak of the trees struggling to remain upright. The creature heard it too and went to investigate. When it got close enough, Cirren pushed the wind harder, causing the trees to topple onto the Terror.
Yvere sprinted out from behind a rock, aiming to make short work of the creature. Cirren also began his sprint down the slope, hoping to get closer before the real action started. Cirren watched closely as Yvere closed the distance, slicing across one of the creature’s pincers, nearly severing it. Unfortunately, the Terror quickly escaped the tangle of branches, scurrying away just as the blade struck.
Cirren saw that the pincer was now useless. Dodging around a rock, he narrowly avoided a bite from the cobra. Recovering his footing, he lashed out with his staff, landing a glancing blow on the cobra’s head. He quickly tried to jab its neck, hoping to stun it. But the creature was too fast. A fang lodged into his shoulder.
Shouting in pain, Cirren whipped his staff around, striking the cobra’s mouth and snapping off the fang embedded in his shoulder. Yvere noticed and slashed at a nearby branch, trapping the creature’s other claw. But with his back turned, he didn’t see the other pincer aimed at his side.
Cirren knelt, helpless, as the pincer closed around Yvere, lifting him off the ground. The scream barely left Yvere’s mouth before the cobra’s remaining fang sank into his neck. The Terror dropped Yvere and watched Cirren, waiting to see what he would do.
Yvere pushed himself up slightly and said, “Run. Gather a party and end this threat once and for all. Bury me at the oasis, under the palms facing the sunset. I’m sorry.”
With that, Yvere fell, groaning in pain, face-first into the sand. The Terror kept glancing between Yvere and Cirren but didn’t move to attack. Cirren backed away, then turned and ran, not stopping until he reached the mouth of the wadir. Turning around, he saw the Terror digging in the sand, almost as if it were searching for something.
Cirren made the hot afternoon trek through the desert alone, his mind flashing back to the look on Yvere’s face as he was bitten. He debated whether he should go back, knowing that the venom in his shoulder might kill him anyway. Finally, just after sundown, he reached the village they had set out from that morning. Stumbling into the torchlight, surrounded by spears, Cirren collapsed onto the sand, losing consciousness.
Cirren awoke in a daze, staring up at smoke gathering inside a tent. Wincing, he slowly sat up, noticing a woman sitting across from him, watching intently.
“You’re finally awake. We weren’t sure you’d live with how deep that fang was in your shoulder,” she said, nodding toward the table beside him. Glancing over, he saw the fang, roughly a hand and a half long. He felt the bandages around his shoulder, noting the thick padding where the fang had sunk in.
“If you’ve made it this far, you’ll live,” she continued, “but I can’t say the marks under your bandage will fade. The venom had far too long to sink in before I could extract it. Judging by the shape you came back in, I’m guessing the Terror yet lives?”
“Indeed it does,” Cirren replied. “But Yvere managed to take out one of the pincers, and being down a fang should make it less deadly. Someone else will have to finish it off. Yvere and I have fought it too many times, and it cost him his life. We knew it was a gamble, but it was one we shouldn’t have taken.”
The healer stood. “Don’t blame yourself, Cirren. Yvere knew the risks, and you both did the tribes a great service. You came closer than anyone to eliminating the threat. You’re welcome to stay here at the oasis for as long as you’d like. And when you’re ready, we’d like to hear the tale you’ve come to tell.”
With that, the healer pushed through the tent’s flap, leaving Cirren alone to reflect…
With his tale at its end, most of the tribe, including the younglings, bowed their heads in respect before returning to their work for the day. 

Cirren absentmindedly drew his dagger and set it on the blanket in front of him. He sat there for a long time, lost in thought, staring at the fang of the beast that took his best friend’s life and nearly claimed his own.

As he came back to reality, he noticed a group of young and energetic adventurers approaching him.

“Yet another group off to feed the Terror that lurks among the sands,” Cirren thought to himself.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has become a popular cosmetic treatment that promises to deliver a brighter, more radiant smile. Many people are curious about the impact of teeth whitening before and after the procedure. Understanding the real results and managing expectations is key to making an informed decision.

When you consider teeth whitening, it's important to recognize that your smile is one of the first things people notice. A brighter smile can boost your confidence and improve your overall appearance. However, there are several factors to weigh before embarking on this journey.

### What to Expect Before Teeth Whitening

Before starting your teeth whitening journey, it's beneficial to consult with a dental professional. They can assess your oral health and determine if you are a good candidate for whitening. Factors to consider include:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Current Shade:** Assess the natural color of your teeth. You can often see a significant difference after treatment.
- **Stains:** Determine the type of stains you have. Extrinsic stains caused by foods and drinks may respond better to whitening.
- **Dental Health:** Ensure you don’t have any cavities, gum disease, or other dental issues that might hinder the process.

Once you get the green light, you’ll need to decide between various whitening options: in-office treatments, at-home kits, and over-the-counter products. Each option can yield different results based on their strength and application.

### The Whitening Process

The procedure typically takes about one hour for in-office treatments. Your dentist will apply a gel that contains hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide to your teeth. This solution breaks down stains and can lead to dramatic results. If you choose at-home kits, the process can take a bit longer, often spanning several days to weeks, depending on the product.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
While using whitening products, it’s crucial to follow the instructions carefully. Overuse can lead to tooth sensitivity or gum irritation. You may notice a slight tingling sensation during the treatment, which is normal. Knowing what to expect can help ease any anxiety associated with the process.

### Teeth Whitening Aftercare

After your whitening session, it's essential to be mindful of what you consume. The first 48 hours post-treatment are critical. Your teeth will be more porous, and certain foods and drinks can cause staining. Here are some tips:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Avoid Staining Foods:** Limit your intake of coffee, red wine, berries, and dark sauces.
- **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water to help wash away any potential stains.
- **Smile Brightly:** Show off your new smile! Confidence is key after achieving a brighter look.

### Real Results: Before and After

Many people report noticeable improvements in the appearance of their smiles after whitening treatments. Before and after photos reveal a stark contrast in tooth brightness, demonstrating the effectiveness of the procedure.

Before treatment, teeth may appear yellowed or dull. After whitening, they can look several shades lighter, positively affecting one’s overall demeanor. However, bear in mind that results can vary based on your initial tooth shade and the severity of staining. It’s also beneficial to have realistic expectations of what the whitening can achieve.

### Maintaining Your Results

To prolong your bright new smile, consider the following maintenance tips:

- **Regular Dental Cleanings:** Schedule dentist appointments every six months for professional cleanings.
- **Touch-Up Treatments:** Use at-home whitening kits as recommended by your dental professional.
- **Good Oral Hygiene:** Brush and floss daily to keep your teeth in top shape.

Managing your expectations is vital. While teeth whitening can lead to impressive before and after results, it’s important to understand that not everyone will achieve the same level of whiter teeth. Some people may need multiple treatments to reach their desired shade. Remember, a brighter smile is an excellent investment, not just in your appearance but in your confidence levels, too.

To sum up, if you're considering teeth whitening, knowing the ins and outs of the process, from preparation to aftercare, will set you up for success. By understanding what to expect before and after, you can confidently take the steps toward achieving a dazzling smile.

Many individuals who use whitening toothpaste pair it with other methods for enhanced results, creating a combined before and after effect in their smiles.

### Natural Remedies

- **Minimal Cost:** Ingredients like baking soda can be found in your kitchen.
- **Limited Results:** Natural methods may not yield dramatic before and after results compared to commercial products.
- **Potential Risks:** Frequent use might damage enamel, so precaution is necessary.

Many users find success with a combination of natural and traditional whitening methods, but individual results may vary.

### Bluetooth-Enabled Whitening Devices

Recently, Bluetooth-enabled devices have entered the market, allowing you to whiten your teeth at home with technology. These devices often use LED light paired with a whitening gel for effective results. Consider the benefits:

This innovative approach offers a blend of convenience and modern technology, appealing to tech-savvy users looking for efficient whitening options.

Choosing the right teeth whitening method ultimately depends on your specific needs, budget, and desired end result. Be sure to assess each method's before and after potential carefully to find the best fit for you. Happy whitening!

I want to share some of the feedback that I'm constantly having to give writers of all levels as an editor. My hope is this will resonate as helpful advice...

**Have confidence in your writing.** Stop waiting for external validation in a world full of people ready to tear your work apart. Inner confidence is what separates the “haves” from the “would-haves.”  
You have to believe in yourself. You have to believe that what you have to say—and how you say it—has value without needing someone to tell you you’re the next big thing. You might not be, and that’s okay. If you’re writing because you love it, stop waiting to be validated. Write with authenticity.

If you are writing to make money, I have but these words for you: *if Colleen Hoover can do it...*  
’Nough said.

If you *do* have something important to say, with goals of getting published, here are my two cents:

**Write as if your reader likes you, understands you, and wants to read your work.** I see so many writers—especially newer ones—writing like they have to cram everything likable about their work into the first paragraph. This behavior stems from a lack of confidence. Part of being a good writer is letting your reader do their job. Your job is to *author*: to tell your story authentically, honestly, and with vulnerability. Let the reader decide if they like what you have to say or how you say it. Stop trying to avoid vulnerability. Avoiding that vulnerability is the fastest way to lose emotional connection with your reader, no matter how exciting your fiction is. Honesty, vulnerability, and authenticity are the elements that resonate with a reader and turn a reader into a fan. We desire connection just as much as you do. We can't connect with you if you don't show us who you really are, or if you're unwilling to be real with us. We also cannot connect with you if you force it. *Buy us dinner first. Court us. Let us get to know you before we decide if you're 'the one.'*

**Connection is born from vulnerability.** Allow yourself the freedom to express. Let the reader see you in your characters, your scenes, and your dialogue. Don’t force them into a manufactured reality where your presence as the writer is the proverbial elephant in the room. We are already listening, stop asking us to listen, and tell us what is on your mind, heart, and soul. We don't need a perfect person to look at in awe, we need someone who understands our hearts who we in turn can understand and empathize with. We need human to human connection, good, bad, and all in-between.

In alignment with this, **stop trying to show the reader every color you can paint with in the first two paragraphs of your story.** We, as readers, already assume you’re both competent and creative—it’s a given. Don’t overcompensate for your lack of confidence by shoving every fun or interesting idea down the reader’s throat before they’ve had time to enjoy the journey. Yes, we get it: your idea is awesome. But tell us the *story,* not just the sparkly idea. We want to take it all in, *slowly.* We want to marvel at Hogwarts for the first time, or take a stroll through the Shire with you, *we want to be there with your character.*  
We don't want this:  
*Super Dog can fly, dive, run, bark the bark of a thousand barks, and even poop on the lawn without blinking! He's amazing and wonderful and the all fulfilling prophecy of Dog Lore!*

Well, that’s great, Robert, but I was told we’d be going on an *adventure*. Can we get back to the story, please? There’s a point here—let’s get to it *together,* shall we? Take us with you. Don’t throw it at us.

**Write what’s good to you.** If it’s not good to you, it’s not going to come together. You are not going to throw paint at a wall, step back, and see *The Starry Night* staring into you. If it *is* good to you, it might still need improvement, but that’s okay—we all need an editor. Write the STORY that's GOOD to you and then find an EDITOR. Stop worrying about your Grammar. You're writing a FIRST DRAFT, and you will inevitably need to clean it up. Sometimes there's a Second, Third, Fourth,...Twenty-Seventh Draft(s). That is fine. Just write the good story. If it's not good to you, the rule of thumb is *it's not good - yet (extra emphasis on the 'yet')*.

**Don’t let the loudest voices in the room be the only ones you hear.** The loudest voice authors usually hear is ~~usually~~ (see, we all need editing\*) their own inner critic. Stop. Shut up. And *write.* You’re your own harshest critic, but here’s the thing: we don’t care if you missed an exclamation mark or used “their” instead of “they’re” in a 4 a.m. coffee-deprived draft. And neither does your editor. I said *editor,* not Sally Shames-A-Lot, who reads your chapter and pretends you’re a second-grader who can’t spell “the.” Leave the editing to the professionals and stop holding yourself back just because your first draft looks like… a first draft. It’s *supposed* to. Breathe. You’ll get there. Write the story. Make it something YOU want to read.

A note: There are way too many armchair editors and self-proclaimed “grammar Nazis” out there, ready to rain on your parade. Guess what? They’re not writing your story. Stop listening to your inner perfectionist who survived your childhood trauma only to saddle you with Imposter Syndrome. WRITE YOUR STORY. Edit later. Grammar Nazis be damned! The story is the soul, we can make it pretty later. There is a time and place for grammatically correct drafts and it's the last one before publishing. Not the first draft to get the story breathing.

**Find Editors. Find Alpha Readers with guts. Find the persons who will be honest with you - for better and for worse - and LISTEN to them. Stop fantasizing that you’ll sit down at a computer and—bing! bang! zoom!—become Rowling.**“You’re a poet and don’t even know it” is a terrible joke, not a prophecy. You’re not in a Disney movie. The prince kissed someone else. And for those of you well beyond age 13—your Hogwarts letter isn’t coming. Stop thinking you’ll sit down and effortlessly churn out your masterpiece. Even Rowling got rejected at least a dozen times before becoming the highest-paid author of all time. Effort is what leads to success. Effort, effort, and more effort—not some magical, snowflake-like talent. Pay your dues. It’s okay to like your own writing. It’s okay to be good at writing and naturally talented. But it’s *not* okay to think a lack of effort is anything more than mediocrity. Reality, folks—revel in it.  
That said, **your first draft is going to suck.** You've started a novel! Enjoy your ticket to the sh\*tshow, I hope you brought popcorn! That reader/editor that made you cry your own tears or bleed your own blood - yeah, that @$$ hole is your BEST FRIEND. Listen when it's constructive. Learn the difference between a nothing-burger comment on ""their"" ""they're"" and ""there"" (which can be fixed with any decent free word processor, by the way) and a comment that may have value like ""I think your character Bobert from Cheeseville needs more depth, I don't understand why he wasn't wearing pants and I feel that may be relevant information."" Or ""I think this is a good start, but it's a little boring."" Those are the comments that you need to reflect on if you want to be a good writer. Re-word it. Re-work it and see what fits. You could be the next Rowling, not every sentence you type will be spun gold and you better know that. You have to have thick skin to do this. You have to believe in yourself enough to be critiqued and humble enough to know when something just does not work. Even the best writers have trash bins full of words that didn't work. Accept it. Your Alpha readers are not here to kiss your butt and if that's what you're after you're in the wrong line of work, stop wasting your time.  
Again, Grammar Nazis be damned! That is the FINAL step before publishing. Your focus is the STORY. The story is your setting, the characters, the plot. It is not wether you aced that second grade spelling test or can find 78 synonyms for ""glanced."" Write your story. Have confidence that will carry you through your own criticism, and then take a deep breath, and let yourself still be ""a real writer"" with real criticism from someone with intelligent feedback.

**You decide if you're ""a real writer."" Not your alpha/beta readers. Not your editors. Not the publishing companies. Let me tell you this: NO GUTS, NO GLORY.**

Have the guts. Have the guts to know your worth, know your skillset, and have the guts to tell the haters to kick rocks and have the guts to hear the ones with intelligent things to say. Have the guts to write with authenticity. Have the guts to write without the need to be published. Have the guts to be a good writer over a published one. Have the guts to write the story in your head that needs to be told.

The best advice I’ve ever gotten, I’ll pass on to you:

**WRITE. THE. THING.**

Then, when you get feedback (hopefully professional), **WRITE. IT. AGAIN.**

Many of you *are* creative and have something fantastic to share with the world. Stop letting your lack of confidence hold you back. Stop letting your incessant inner voice tell you that without validation it's pointless. Be a good writer. Be a better writer. You have a unique voice. Stop trying to force the world to see that and validate you before *you* see it. When you see your worth and write from that place, you’ll become that much better. Better is what publishers need. Do the work. Write.

1h9sa2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h9sa2a/aitah_for_wanting_to_go_to_no_gifts_between_adults/,AITAH for wanting to go to no gifts between adults?,"TL:DR 
My brother and SIL are bad at gift giving. It bothers me, I tried to make this Christmas a kids only gifts. I'm the bad guy.

I(40m) get it I'm not the nicest guy in the world, I doubt I ever will be but I do try. 

Backstory: my child hood was rough and involved things that could get people locked up even today. I won't go into what as it could trigger people, this is important to know. I was usually left with gifts that meant little or nothing to me and definitely not what I asked for. My brother on the other hand wanted for nothing. As an example: one year he got a full stereo deck, probably 700-800 dollars worth. I was given a telescope, probably 50 to 60 dollars, and had no interest in space at all. We were both in our late teens at the time. 

Also my SIL is not very loved by my family, she usually will not even be around us when the opportunity arises. Mouths off and insults people regularly. 

Fast forward to this year. I turn 40 only one who even bothers to care is my wife. Fine by me, but I instead blow family off so I can spend time with her and our daughter. They get mad and say I'm causing issues because everyone wants to see us. My father plans a huge surprise party for his girlfriend, doesn't even wish me a happy birthday, brother plans big football watch party, both times I  just blow them off, no real excuses. 

I learn the lesson that people see you as the enemy when you advocate for yourself.

I did get a gift card to a movie theater from my brother, which I don't go to the movies. I've been less than 5 times since I've been an adult. I just don't go. The card was handed to me with the line ""we tried our best."" This is a standard practice with him and my SIL. I usually get a mug(i don't drink coffee or tea) or a gift for my daughter. The irrelevant gifts piss me off. 

Why? Because they can't even spend the energy/time to send a text and ask anyone what I may want. It makes me feel like I don't even have enough worth to get to know me at all. Either I'm a piece of trash or they hate me, is how I see it. 

Have I said that Outlook? Not to them, there'd be questions and I'd rather not have to explain the BS I dealt with as a kid. Not to mention my brother thinks the world of the one that did the bad stuff. It's just easier to shoulder it myself. 

So why is all this important? I suggested we go ""no gifts between adults."" Just get the kids stuff. I pitched it as cheaper and easier, less stress less fuss. I was confronted by my SIL openly at their eldest's tenth birthday party, and rather publicly, I'll add. 

I was told that my SIL loves to figure out what to get people and spends a lot of time on it. I responded with ""I've had to institute a mug in mug out policy in my house because of the number of mugs coming in."" Yes I actually said it. 

All of it comes down to now they are wanting to do a secret Santa and I'm the bad guy ruining Christmas for my SIL. 

I dont care about how expensive a gift is. 5 dollars or 500 doesn't mean anything to me, but taking the time to make it good is important. I've got a marshmallow roaster that probably cost someone 5 dollars. It looks like a fishing pole and even turns with the reel. The thing has a dedicated space on my mantle.

1h9s9ho,https://i.redd.it/n6sd7ltvro5e1.png,Passed with AT in all domains! Thanks r/CAPM!,"The beginning of 2024, I had taken the decision to have a career shift and foray towards the domain of project management. I picked up Google's PM specialisation course on Coursera. While I found it really helpful, I quickly found out that it wasn't really intended to help course takers be prepared for writing their CAPM exam, but to be job ready. 

Wish I took Google's courses AFTER I passed my CAPM......but completing the course did fetch me a code to get the CAPM certification from PMI at a much needed discounted price. (Broke af)

I started to frantically search for resources on study materials to pass the CAPM exam, and that's when I stumbled upon this subreddit. Joseph Phillips and Andrew Ramdayal were so often suggested across the board in every post, that these two can basically be considered the patron saints of r/capm.

## So what did I choose for my prep materials?

Just two thingamajigs.

• Andrew Ramdayal's Udemy course and;
• his TIA CAPM exam simulator

That's it. These two were extremely invaluable in helping me grasp the concepts without the need to memorise anything (save for a few formulas). During lessons, he'd frequently stress upon not memorising concepts, but to understand them from the point of view of a Project Manager, and he did deliver on that as I found myself tackling questions without much confusion or second guessing by simply approaching problems from the POV of a PM.

When I was done with the course, I decided to set a deadline and schedule the test at the end of the week. I looked up AR's TIA Exam Simulator for mock tests, and honestly....I really can't thank this tool enough. For every question you do on the mock test, AR has created a video explanation for each one of them, helping you understand why the chosen answer was the best out of the rest and why others weren't. This was a game changer as it greatly helped me to get a final boost in cementing my understanding of concepts, without second guessing, and I was able to get 85%+ in all the 5 mock tests.

During the test itself, if I found myself stumped at a question, I'd imagine AR reading the questions out loud and going through the options explain which one would be the best of the 4 options.

After I was done with mocks, I finally scheduled my judgement day on a Sunday afternoon. 

Of course my nerves got the best of me as I neared the date and started searching for more suggestions/ tips/ mock papers/ important domains to cover again on the subreddit.

# DO NOT DO THAT!

Stick to your original plan. And trust the process. (the PM processes as well). I started going through a Landini mock paper, and whenever I found myself unable to answer a question, I'd start doubting my preparation. That's when I took a step back and closed the mock test page, and said to myself to trust my hard work.


Judgement day arrived. Woke up at a respectable time (9 AM), ate light lunch and some coffee, and sat for the exam at the comfort and convenience of my home. The online verification process by Pearson Vue was hassle free. 

## What did the exam cover?

Found several questions to be almost similar, and some downright identical to the few questions that I did from TIA Exam Simulator.  

- A few questions on PM core concepts. You should be able to ace this domain without much effort. But definitely go through them once more after you're done with your course, to confirm that the concepts have been registered in your noggin.

- Not a whole lot on predictive methodology. Mostly questions asking if the mentioned project is suited best to follow predictive/adaptive/hybrid approach. UNDERSTAND the 49 processes and tools, do not MEMORISE them.

- Learn about the critical path method.

- Your usual EVM formula questions. Nothing too fancy

- Many questions on Adaptive/Agile frameworks. Best know the difference between Increment and Iterative planning. Understand Scrum terms and methodologies. Also read up on other Agile methods such as Kanban, FDD, XP programming, Crystal and so on.
There were a few questions on DSDM which weren't covered by AR. Thankfully I had visited the subreddit a few times before the exam and found that out from a few exam takers.

- BA questions mostly focused on requirements management and the tools used to organise and prioritise requirements, and of course, the roles of a BA within the organisation. Learn about Requirements Traceability Matrix as well.

There were a few other questions that were outright impossible for me to solve since neither have I heard or read about those terms anywhere during my prep, nor was I able to solve it using PM methodologies.  I'm also having a hard time remembering these questions. But I'd wager that these questions were part of the 15 pretest questions which are unscored.

And that's about it. As soon I clicked the final submit button, I was greeted with a page congratulating me for passing the exam. 

A great weight was lifted. Two days later, I received my certificate via email, as well as a detailed report card on my performance (a part of it on the pic posted). Dobby found his sock and was free.

And that's that.

Do feel free to ask me questions regarding my preparation, the exams, or just about anything random you could think of and thought of asking.

We were an Incubation store, we were consistently in the top 10 of our district, we had a good crew and our regulars were fantastic. I was a Coffee Master, I was a shift, I won the Origins trip, I helped train our current DM. And now I don't have a job. 

It's been a long 8 years, but I can still remember my interview like it was yesterday. I was happy, proud even, to be a partner at my store. And now it's gone.

It has been a joy to work with my coworkers, and an absolute delight to meet my regulars. I wish them nothing but the best. But I pray for them, because I know things are about to get a lot worse for all of them. We already lost a lot of good partners due to our current manager, I was the one who had been there the longest, I was one of the people that partners would go to for advice or questions.

Previously we had a blade grinder, so I was really looking forward to it.  Unfortunately, it's had nothing but problems. It struggles to auto feed, had the beans fall in just the right way to jam the chute from the hopper to the auger (hard slaps didn't fix it), and fully clogging the exit chute after just a week.

Today I hit my limit and decided to return it.  Before I did though, I figured I should grind some beans to hold me over while I wait for the next grinder to get here.  Typically we make a 50/50 blend of decaf and regular so we can drink more coffee throughout the day.  My wife isn't into the fresh ground process, so we have one mason jar of ground regular and one mason jar of ground decaf.  

While grinding to fill the jars I noticed that the medium roast didn't clog it at all and there were no grounds on top of the catch cup.  The ionizer was finally working!  I switched to the dark roast decaf beans and it instantly started to clog the exit shoot and made a mess on the catch cup again.  So the problem was the beans, not the grinder.  I couldn't believe it!

So my questions are:

How likely am I to run into this issue?  Is this more common for decaf beans?  Dark roast?  Or did I just happen to buy really poor quality beans and the roast level has nothing to do with it?  Also, are conical burrs less susceptible to this issue?  I'm still in the return window and could exchange it for a baratza instead.",1,1733689710.0,JamesHoffmann,2,1.0,False

Friday was her last day at work. 9 months later my NC journey can finally begin, but I am at my lowest point. ","We were together for just over a year, and broke up 9 months ago. Working 10 ft away from each other all day every day has made this the most painful and impossible feeling rollercoaster of a breakup I've ever experienced. I've had 2 previous relationships that lasted about 4 years each, and neither of those breakups were ANYWHERE near as hard as this one has been. Having to hear her laugh, see her smile and talk about her life, weekends and holidays without me with our co-workers in the office has made healing and moving on impossible. However, Friday was her last day at work and I'm desperately hoping this brings me some peace.

This entire time I have been following her like a lost puppy. Constantly doing things like bringing her coffee and lunch to show her I still care. I have pathetically begged to get back together a few times, but it feels like I've done nothing but push her away. But we have had multiple stretches of time where things are great and it seems like we're reconnecting again, but I ALWAYS ruin it by trying to rush things right back to how they were before instead of taking it slow like she has asked.

Last night we had our office Christmas party and I asked her to be my +1 since she still wanted to go. This turned out to be a major mistake that has left me in so much pain for multiple reasons. We ended up talking afterwards and we both broke down crying. She was incredibly blunt and straightforward with me, saying that she hasn't missed me this entire time because she hasn't had the chance to miss me, since I've been lingering around and not giving her space for the past 9 months. She also said she loves me as a person, but doesn't love me romantically anymore. The entire night left me even more heart broken and at my lowest point. However, she did ask for 2 weeks of time and space to reset and reassess how she feels. But I'm not feeling very optimistic based on what she said about not loving me anymore.

I sincerely hope the combination of NC and not seeing her every day anymore is what my heart needs to finally heal so I can move on with my life. It's going to be so hard, but I am going to respect what she asked for and give her the 2 weeks of space. If I don't hear from her in 2 weeks, I made a promise to myself to NOT pursue it and keep moving forward with NC.",1,1733689520.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

Anyway, I planned a surprise dinner for our two year anniversary because he’s been working so hard these last few months and I wanted to do something nice for a change. I booked us in for 8pm at a Premier Inn (his fav) because I thought that it would give him enough time to get there (he finishes work at 5pm and would take 10-15 mins for him to get there). But he called me at 7:55pm to say he got held up at work and had to help the new girl let’s call her Mia, I asked how long he was going to be (I was willing to wait until 10pm) he said he don’t think he could make it until 9:30pm. I said that’s fine and during that time I looked up this girl turns out she’s not new she’s been there for 4 months. It got to 9:31pm and I gave up I text him to say I’m going home I’ll see him later (I also gave the restaurant his card number and ate starter, dinner, dessert and a bottle of wine 😉). He text me saying he was going to be 5 mins but I left him on read and went to bed. Fast forward 2 months I’ve heard from him to say he was sorry I said we needed some space and haven’t heard from him since but I did meet up with this girl in a Starbucks and she was pregnant so I let her go infront of me, she was very thankful. She gave her name and her name by coincidence was MIA. She sat down at a table and after I got my coffee I asked if I could sit with her (she looked upset). We got talking turns out she’s 5 months along and she works at the same place my boyfriend does I asked if she was seeing anyone and she said HIS NAME. I asked how long they’ve been together she said he asked her out once she was pregnant and they met through work on a night out DRUNK.

Community places are dwindling in the valley, since covid, but also because almost everything is online now. Retail prices are sky high, and thrift stores are being ransacked every weekend. People are upselling, reselling, and trying to just make it by. So... no thanks... my car doesn't need washing every other day!  Thanks anyway, folks... We need community!

And we're trying to make that happen!

My best friend and I are opening up a small craft business, selling yarn/supplies, and offering classes. Knitting, crouching, weaving, dying yarns, and felting. Our aim is to work with other small businesses in the craft community to build up what has been lacking here in the valley -- places to gather, reconnect, and inspire creativity. 

We're hoping to open our doors shortly after the new year. Our small storefront is located in Central Point on Pine St. just after the Chase Bank. 

We're also going to offer complimentary coffee, tea, and pastries.A place to connect and join each other In Real Life. 

We really hope to see you there! 

If you want to help create a gathering space for all crafters and people who love them, we have Flyers going up around town, and there's also one taped to the window at the shop. 

We also have an Instagram and will work on getting a Facebook. I'm not including the links because I'm not sure what we're allowed to post for this sub.

My only quip is that it seems he never wants to reciprocate gifts/favors. Throughout our relationship I’ve gotten him little surprises: randomly sending flowers, ordering Uber eats for him, getting coffee/cupcakes/sweet treats delivered to his house. It’s one of the ways that I like to express my love and I think it really can make someone feel very special/loved. However, my boyfriend can’t seem to get the message that I’d like to receive these things as well.

I’ve had an open discussion with him about this a couple of months ago.  I talked about how it made me feel and he said that he just isn’t very good at remembering to send those kinds of things but that he would try to remember. Months went by and nothing changed. So this past week, I ordered him breakfast as a surprise to see if maybe it would remind him of our discussion. So far, nothing yet.

I’d just like to add; I’m not saying that he HAS to get me anything. If he doesn’t want to participate, I wish he would just tell me that instead of saying that it’s an issue of him “not thinking about it”. It’s not a money issue, we both make around the same and have similar spending/savings habits. Whenever we do Christmas, birthday, anniversary presents we always reciprocate and will set a price limit. It’s just the little small stuff that he doesn’t reciprocate. And will also say that he is very appreciative whenever I send him anything. He thanks me profusely and will always say how special it makes him feel.

Misleading Practices by Blink It – A Consumer’s Worst Nightmare

I recently had an extremely disappointing experience with Blink It, and I feel compelled to share it with everyone. Here’s what happened:

I ordered COLOMBIAN BREW instant coffee from their app, and their official product page clearly stated that each 2g sachet contains 400mg of caffeine. Based on this information, I placed the order. But what I received was an absolute shock. The box I received had the exact same design and details—except it stated 200mg of caffeine instead of 400mg.

This is not a small error. It’s a blatant example of misleading advertising and deceptive trade practices. Selling products under the pretense of incorrect ingredient information is not just unethical—it’s downright fraudulent.

When I raised this issue, the customer service experience was equally pathetic. I initially chatted with a representative named Barina, who tried to shift the blame onto me, implying that I had misread the details. But when I showed her the discrepancy in black and white, she had no choice but to agree. Instead of addressing the issue or acknowledging their mistake, all she did was repeatedly offer me a return option.

Let me be clear: My intention was not to return the product. I wanted to bring this serious issue to their attention, but their response was dismissive and tone-deaf. It was as if they already knew about the issue and simply didn’t care.

What’s even more infuriating is the bigger picture here. This kind of behavior reflects how these apps and stores operate—they bank on the fact that most customers won’t bother to scrutinize what they receive. They think they can slide by with such malpractices because customers don’t have the time or energy to escalate these issues.

Well, Blink It, I’m escalating it now.

To all fellow consumers: always double-check what you receive. These companies clearly take their customers for granted, and it’s time we hold them accountable.

Blink It, you’ve lost a customer for life, and I hope others think twice before trusting you. Your deceptive practices are shameful and pathetic. If this is the standard you uphold, you deserve to be called out publicly.

1h9rksr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1h9rksr/aita_for_telling_off_at_my_boyfriend_for_being/,AITA for telling off at my boyfriend for being repeatedly late on our dates?,"I 22F and my bf 23M, have been together for 8 months but known each other for almost a decade.

Eversince I knew him, we'd go out for coffee or food, sometimes grouped up with other people, and I am not the person to be mad if someone is late because something happened, or they are forced to use the bus, which can be unreliable.

The problem is, 50% of those times if not more, he'd be 10 minutes to even an hour late at times, and before I would joke about it but never really kept him accountable. Not long ago he was 15 minutes late, and something in me was like enough is enough, and mentioned that I didn't like that he wasn't respecting my time, since he is perfectly able to show up in time, as he lives 12-15 minutes away by foot. I also totally get he probably has undiagnosed adhd, and focuses on tasks while forgetting others. I recommeded he sets timers, or I can call him to remind him and stuff.

A lot of the times, when I voice such concerns, I feel like I am not being heard, and it just gets brushed off. I don't even get an apology as he keeps saying ""I am not sorry, so I won't apologise if that is what you are expecting"". I ended up just forgetting about it, and eversince that time I do think he took it more seriously and started showing up on time, but I still can't shake that sentence off. He is otherwise the best person I've ever met, and we honestly go together pretty well, so this is just one of those small flaws, which at least he is trying to improve upon.

AITA?

Edit: Thank you everyone who has or will reply, some of the suggestions have been very helpful, a second and third opinion is always appreciated. As he legit doesn't have any other serious flaw, I think I will wait and see how it unravels and act accordingly.

To be honest, I was legit dumbfounded when he said he wasn't sorry about it, and he has said the same thing about 2-3 times in total that I can remember, but this one took the cake. I think it's my biggest issue in the whole conversation, as he asked me to forget about it so it doesn't ruin the night out in the fashion of ""Are you going to let something so insignificant ruin our date?"". This whole thing felt out of character, or maybe I don't know him as well as I thought I did.

Edit 2: To the people suggesting I simply tell him an earlier time and show up later so that I won't wait, it's not that it's a bad idea, I have thought about it. I just don't have the heart to do it in the case he is actually there earlier and have to wait for me instead. I am more ok with waiting as I have many times instead of it happening the other way around. ",22,1733688644.0,AmItheAsshole,49,0.85,False
