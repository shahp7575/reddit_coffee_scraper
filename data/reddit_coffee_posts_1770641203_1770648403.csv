1r05zeo,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1r05zeo/diy_home_assistant_family_dashboard_with_voice/,DIY Home Assistant family dashboard with voice input (calendar + tasks + meals),"Hey folks,



Over the past few months I built a dedicated Home Assistant smart display for our kitchen. It started as a side project, but it’s now fully working and my family uses it every day, so I figured it might be useful beyond just our house.



It combines:

• Voice add/edit calendar  

• Tasks / todos  

• Meal planning + groceries  

• Full-screen family dashboard  

• Home Assistant controls  



The main idea was simple: something the whole family can walk up to and use without opening apps or touching their phones.

Some real-life examples from our house:

– “add soccer practice tomorrow 5pm”  

– “what’s on today?” while making coffee  

– kids checking “what’s for dinner”  

– adding groceries while cooking  

– turning off lights / locking doors before bed  

– quick glance at the day’s schedule on the counter



So it feels more like a small household appliance than a DIY tablet dashboard.

At this point it’s pretty stable. Before polishing it further, I’d love feedback from other HA users.

If anyone’s curious to try the prototype or help test, I’m happy to share it with a few folks and hear what you think.",1,1770648164.0,homeassistant,1,1.0,False

Wore this to a rooftop hang and got asked if it fell out of Blade Runner. Gears visible through the case—nerd flex unlocked. Time drifts 15 seconds fast weekly… but honestly? I check my phone anyway. Vibe > accuracy.

nike everyday ankle socks
$ 15? Hard pass. Shrank after wash, swoosh peeled off, hole before first wear. Felt like damp tissue. My feet filed for divorce. Uniqlo socks cost less and actually last.

fog essentials hoodie
Pulled it on straight from the bag, walked to grab bodega coffee. Fabric’s stupid soft, no tag itch, tiny ""ESSENTIALS"" text barely whispers on the chest. Washed twice—zero pilling, zero fading. The quiet flex that actually works. Already my go-to.

carhartt workwear zip-up
Smells like sawdust and confidence. Heavy canvas, zipper fights back at first (respect). Light rain? Beaded right off. Pockets deep enough for keys, phone, and my existential dread. Not ""fashion."" Just works.

amiri black hoodie
Silver ""AMIRI"" embroidery on the back catches dim bar light like a secret signal. Hood’s oversized, fabric thick enough for fall nights. Drawstrings too long—keep dipping in my latte. Still, wore it once and got ""you in a band?"" vibes. Worth the coffee stains.

carsicko grey hoodie
Tiny red heart patch on chest, hand-stitched energy. No logo screaming for attention. Wore it with black jeans, got zero compliments—and that’s why I love it. For me, not the algorithm.

carsicko grey pants
Same heart patch, same red drawcord. Cuffs so tight I had to roll them twice. Look fire in the mirror… walk like a confused penguin. One-and-done for photos only.

Monogram crisp, ""VUITTON"" strap legit. Sole harder than my will to adult. Two hours in = feet screaming for mercy. Now living on my shelf like modern art. Flex tax paid. No shame.

Soulmate Story is an online service that makes a custom sketch of your future soulmate. It uses astrology and psychic intuition. You enter your name, birth date, and relationship preferences.

Then, a psychic artist draws and describes your destined partner. It's a symbolic representation of the person you might love.

The program is run by a psychic artist named Lia Arden. She claims to tap into cosmic energy for each portrait. It's meant to help you imagine your destined love, not to find a real match.

# How Does Soulmate Story Work?

Soulmate Story works online in a few steps. First, you fill out a short form on their website. Then, the Soulmate Story team creates your results.

1. **Enter Your Details:** Fill in your name, birth date (star sign) and email. Accuracy matters, since these details personalize your soulmate portrait.
2. **Set Your Preferences:** Choose your soulmate’s gender and relationship status (e.g., married or single) to guide the drawing.
3. **Pay and Confirm:** Complete the secure checkout and pay the one-time fee (around $37). There are no ongoing subscriptions.
4. **Receive Your Soulmate Story:** In about 24–48 hours, you’ll get an email with your full-color digital portrait and a written story. The artwork is high-resolution (so you can print or share it) and the narrative explains who this person might be, their traits, and how you may meet.

All of this happens online – you never meet the artist in person, and everything is delivered digitally. The official site promises quick service, and many customers do receive their soulmate sketch within a couple of days.

 In short, you enter your info, pay, then wait a short time for your personalized soulmate drawing and description to arrive by email.

# What’s Inside the Soulmate Story Package?

When you buy Soulmate Story, you get a digital download with three main parts:

* **Soulmate Sketch (Portrait Drawing):** A high-resolution hand-drawn portrait of your soulmate. This is an artistic sketch (not a photo) meant to capture the “essence” of your future partner. The style tends to focus on mood and expression, making the image feel personal and emotionally resonant.
* **Written Profile:** A brief personality description of your soulmate. This profile lists character traits, habits, and quirks (for example, how they smile or act) based on your astrological signs. It ties your zodiac traits into clues about who this person is inside and out.
* **Meeting Scenario:** A short narrative that connects you and the soulmate. Often it’s a little story or scene (like bumping into each other at a coffee shop under a specific zodiac sign) that describes how you might meet your soulmate. This scene links the portrait and profile into one fun story.

All these items are delivered as files on the website or by email – there’s no physical product. The idea is that you can view or print the portrait and read the story right away. Everything is based on the details you provided (especially your birth chart) plus the artist’s intuitive insight, so it feels tailored to you.

# Benefits of the Soulmate Story Sketch Program

* **It's a fun twist on love and astrology.** Users love the ""sneak peek"" of their soulmate. It feels magical and exciting.
* **You get a custom portrait just for you.** People say the sketch looks professional and detailed. It's a nice conversation piece.
* The ordering process is simple and fast. You get a digital portrait in 1–2 days. It's quicker than other services.
* The price is low, around $37 after discounts. There are no hidden fees or subscriptions. You can get a full refund if you're not happy.
* It makes you think about your love life. The profile and story help you focus on what you want in a partner. It inspires self-growth.

Overall, fans find it enjoyable and inspiring. Even if you don't meet someone right away, the portrait is comforting.

# Soulmate Story Customer Reviews

Customer feedback on Soulmate Story is mixed. Many people report positive experiences. For example, satisfied customers often say the drawing was detailed and emotional and “felt personal”. 

One review site noted a very high rating (around 4.9 out of 5 stars) from users who felt the sketches truly captured the heart of their story. People frequently praise the artwork quality and the fast turnaround. Fans also appreciate the 60-day guarantee, which makes them feel they have nothing to lose when trying it.

However, not everyone is happy. Some customers say the sketch can look generic or symbolic. A few reports mention that many drawings seem to have similar faces or features. One reviewer even said the portrait felt more like an “archetype” – a generally attractive person – rather than someone they personally knew. 

Others felt let down if the drawing didn’t match anyone they had in mind. But this doesn't happen to everyone. It happens to some people. When the face doesn't match. Delivery delays also come up as complaints: even though the site ***promises 24–48 hours, some customers report waiting much longer.*** 

In short, the reviews vary widely. If you go in expecting a fun and personal experience, you may really enjoy it.  

# Who Is Soulmate Story Ideal For?

Soulmate Story is for people curious about their love life. It's especially for those open to creative or spiritual ideas. It appeals to:

* **Astrology Enthusiasts:** If you like zodiac signs and cosmic insights, you'll enjoy Soulmate Story. It talks about sun signs, star alignments, and traits tied to your horoscope. Astrology fans often find this interesting.
* **Spiritually Open People:** The service mixes intuition with tech, perfect for those who believe in psychic guidance. If you think the universe sends signs or connects you with your soulmate, you might find this meaningful.
* **Gift Seekers:** Soulmate Story makes a unique personalized gift. Many buy it for friends, partners, or family as a surprise. It's like a custom portrait about their future love, a special keepsake.

# Is Soulmate Story Legit or a Scam?

Soulmate Story is a real service that gives you a custom digital drawing and story for your money. It's not a scam where you pay and get nothing. The website clearly explains how it works and calls it an ***entertainment/spiritual tool***, not a guaranteed matchmaking formula.

Reviews say it's an art-based novelty product, not a scientific love-finding device. The company offers a clear **refund policy (usually 60 days)**. If you're not happy with your sketch, you can get a full refund. This money-back guarantee makes the offer feel safe.

So, Soulmate Story is not a fraud scheme. You will get a drawing and story as promised. Just remember, the results are meant to be mystical and inspirational, not factual.

# Where to Buy Soulmate Story?

Buy Soulmate Story only from the official website. The program is sold directly through its own site (often linked to ClickBank for payment). The official site is run by the creator and has clear Soulmate Story branding. Avoid any copycat websites or unknown sellers claiming to offer it.

The official Soulmate Story site has the best price (currently around $37 after any discounts) and the 60-day money-back guarantee. Always check that the website looks professional and mentions the guarantee. Don't try to buy it on random e-commerce stores or social media ads – those are likely scams. 

The safest way to get Soulmate Story is through the official site, which will deliver your purchase with the promised refund policy.

1r05u4p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r05u4p,[Cigar Review #50] West Tampa Tobacco Black Series (Robusto),"Intro  
The Black Series is the second product launched by West Tampa Tobacco, a brand created by Rick Rodriguez after his departure from CAO in 2022. Both products are made in Nicaragua, and while they essentially share the same blend (Ecuadorian Habano wrapper over a Nicaraguan binder and filler) the Black Series wrapper comes from a leaf higher up on the plant, receiving more sunlight and thus developing a richer flavor. The Black Series binder is from the Ometepe island, and the filler is from the Condega and Estelí regions. Among my tobacco sources, I heard and read so much about this cigar that when I found a 5-pack at a good price, I bought it without having tried it. The cigar was in my humidor for six months before I tried it.

Appearance  
In the case of this cigar, I'm going to try the robusto, which has the classic 5 x 50 size. The cigar is very dark, with a remarkable amount of oils on the wrapper, partly thanks to its origin and the good aging. That wrapper has aromas of cedar, barnyard, straw, leather, and earth, while at the foot, there's a more dominant and intense note of cedar, cacao nibs, pepper, and cherry. After a straight cut, the cold draw gives me aromas of wood, freshly brewed coffee, pepper, and cherry.

First Third  
I'll start by noting the strong peppery notes that greet me as soon as I light the cigar. These are accompanied by creamy cedar and ground coffee notes as the dominant flavors, while the secondary notes include nutmeg, allspice, bread, leather, and a strong peppery retrohale. The intensity is medium, although the pepper makes me question that level, while the strength is solid and definitely medium. The smoke is abundant, and given the timing and duration of this first third, it doesn't require any touch-ups.

Second Third  
Thanks to the band's size, I have to remove it before I even reach the middle section of the cigar. It's at the beginning of the second third that the flavors undergo a shift, and it's not a transition but more of a complete change, where the dominant flavors are leather and wood, but this wood note seems to be a completely different type. The secondary flavors are varied and include burnt meat, nutmeg, cacao nibs, and an earthy note that reminds me more of mushrooms, but this disappears by the time I reach the halfway point of the Black Series. The retrohale maintains the pepper but also includes black cherries, and both intensity and strength have increased by a notch, although I wouldn't say they're medium-high at the moment. There are a couple of minor technical adjustments I had to make, but nothing worrisome, more of a preventative measure, while the smoke remains abundant.

Last Third  
The flavors in the final third are very similar to those in the second, with wood and leather being the main ones, while the secondary notes include burnt meat, earth, cinnamon, coffee, and a very mild citrus peel. There are also mineral notes throughout the final third, which must be some lingering earth flavor, while the need for touch-ups becomes more pronounced. The flavors reach a medium-high intensity, although the strength remains medium during this third. It took me an hour and a half to smoke this cigar to the end, including when it nearly went out with a few minutes left, but I relit it because I didn't want it to finish.

Conclusion  
For those wondering why the cigar brand is named after Tampa and not Miami, which has been more famous for hosting Cubans and their descendants, including Rick Rodriguez's family at one time, the fact is that Tampa was the American capital of tobacco manufacturing before and after the Cuban Revolution, specifically in the city of Ybor, located very close to Tampa. I've always wanted to visit it, although nowadays it's more of a tourist trip than an opportunity to try new products and tour factories. As for the cigar itself, it's a medium-strength smoke, with both intensity and smoke hit only increasing in the final third, but it's at that point that the smoke becomes less enjoyable, mainly due to its construction. I remember smoking one a week after they arrived, and that experience compared to the last two has been considerably different, although I think it's a cigar I would gladly buy again.

Score: **87**

Many people believe that the higher the score, the better the cigar, and it makes perfect sense. But this logic tends to imply that any score less than x automatically means the cigar is crap. That's what I want to avoid because there are cigars for different occasions, and not all of them aim to be the best of the best.

Additionally, let's keep in mind that my tastes are my own. There's a cigar that you might think is excellent, and maybe I smoke it, and it doesn't seem that way to me. Likewise, one that I gave a high score and recommend buying by the box, and you smoke it, and it seems all sorts of different to you. These are my opinions. Take them as you wish.

With that in mind, here's a scale of what each score means:

0-25 You have nothing to look for here  
26-49 Use it only if you're doing religious rites, but the spirits probably won't like it  
50-59 A good cigar to quit smoking  
60-69 It's a cigar to give as a gift, especially if you don't want to be asked to gift cigars again  
70-74 Good for a smoke where you don't care what you're smoking  
75-79 Still a decent smoke, but forgettable  
80-84 A good smoke, the kind you'll buy 5-packs of every once in a while  
85-89 Excellent smoke and a cigar you'll want to keep regularly in your humidor  
90-94 Permanent part of the humidor  
95-98 The best of the best. Boxworthy  
99-100 Consider selling body parts online to buy this

1r05tpr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r05tpr,[Cigar Review #50] West Tampa Tobacco Black Series (Robusto),"Intro  
The Black Series is the second product launched by West Tampa Tobacco, a brand created by Rick Rodriguez after his departure from CAO in 2022. Both products are made in Nicaragua, and while they essentially share the same blend (Ecuadorian Habano wrapper over a Nicaraguan binder and filler) the Black Series wrapper comes from a leaf higher up on the plant, receiving more sunlight and thus developing a richer flavor. The Black Series binder is from the Ometepe island, and the filler is from the Condega and Estelí regions. Among my tobacco sources, I heard and read so much about this cigar that when I found a 5-pack at a good price, I bought it without having tried it. The cigar was in my humidor for six months before I tried it.

Appearance  
In the case of this cigar, I'm going to try the robusto, which has the classic 5 x 50 size. The cigar is very dark, with a remarkable amount of oils on the wrapper, partly thanks to its origin and the good aging. That wrapper has aromas of cedar, barnyard, straw, leather, and earth, while at the foot, there's a more dominant and intense note of cedar, cacao nibs, pepper, and cherry. After a straight cut, the cold draw gives me aromas of wood, freshly brewed coffee, pepper, and cherry.

First Third  
I'll start by noting the strong peppery notes that greet me as soon as I light the cigar. These are accompanied by creamy cedar and ground coffee notes as the dominant flavors, while the secondary notes include nutmeg, allspice, bread, leather, and a strong peppery retrohale. The intensity is medium, although the pepper makes me question that level, while the strength is solid and definitely medium. The smoke is abundant, and given the timing and duration of this first third, it doesn't require any touch-ups.

Second Third  
Thanks to the band's size, I have to remove it before I even reach the middle section of the cigar. It's at the beginning of the second third that the flavors undergo a shift, and it's not a transition but more of a complete change, where the dominant flavors are leather and wood, but this wood note seems to be a completely different type. The secondary flavors are varied and include burnt meat, nutmeg, cacao nibs, and an earthy note that reminds me more of mushrooms, but this disappears by the time I reach the halfway point of the Black Series. The retrohale maintains the pepper but also includes black cherries, and both intensity and strength have increased by a notch, although I wouldn't say they're medium-high at the moment. There are a couple of minor technical adjustments I had to make, but nothing worrisome, more of a preventative measure, while the smoke remains abundant.

Last Third  
The flavors in the final third are very similar to those in the second, with wood and leather being the main ones, while the secondary notes include burnt meat, earth, cinnamon, coffee, and a very mild citrus peel. There are also mineral notes throughout the final third, which must be some lingering earth flavor, while the need for touch-ups becomes more pronounced.

Quieter, fewer places open, colder winds (-20C today - eeeeek)

If you’ve got a night/or weekend here in the colder months, here’s a great way to do it without fighting the cold.



# Day 1 — arrive, warm up, slow down

**Afternoon**

Arrive and head straight to **Picton** or **Bloomfield,** depending on where you’re staying.

Winter PEC rule #1:  
Don’t over-plan. Wandering around is ok. 

* Coffee first.
* Walk Main Street even if it’s windy (it will be).
* Pop into a couple of shops that are actually open (hours vary in winter). Favourites incl:
   * [Beacon](https://www.instagram.com/beaconbikebrew/)
   * [Royal Hotel](https://www.instagram.com/theroyalhotelpicton/)
   * [Rise](https://www.instagram.com/rise.coffee.house/) \- their pastry is out of this world tasty 
   * [Citizen Frances](https://www.instagram.com/citizen_frances/) (1 or 2 indoor seats tho)

If you’re doing wineries/breweries:

* Pick **one** that’s open year-round.
* Expect shorter hours / and maybe even closures.
   * [Matron](https://www.instagram.com/matronfinebeer/) \*Bonus, they have had a pop-up sauna once a week (midweek-sorry)
   * [Grange](https://www.instagram.com/grangewinery/)
   * [Trail Estate](https://www.instagram.com/trailestatewine/)
   * [Slake](https://www.instagram.com/slakebrewing/) \* Sunsets here are unreal! 

**Dinner**

Winter is when reservations are easier—but not guaranteed. A lot of restaurants are closed / seasonal or open sporadically. 

* Check hours ahead (many spots close midweek). Insta is your most up-to-date resource in many cases. 
* Book ahead - restaurants appreciate this.
* Local favs:  
   * [Darlings](https://www.instagram.com/darlings.pec/) \*\*Now offering takeout so you do not have to leave your new home
   * [Flame & Smith](https://www.instagram.com/flameandsmith/)
   * [Theia](https://www.instagram.com/____theia/)

**Evening**

* Cozy drinks somewhere warm
* Board games, vinyl, long conversations
* Or just lean into “doing nothing”

Evening entertainment

   * [Russ & Co.](https://www.instagram.com/therussandco/) \- Think moody speakeasy 
   * [Bar Duchess](https://www.instagram.com/barduchess/)
   * [The Royal Hotel](https://www.instagram.com/theroyalhotelpicton/)

# Day 2 — cold air, good food, minimal driving

**Morning**

Start slow.

* Coffee + breakfast 
   * See cafe suggestions \^\^ 
   * Add: [Lilly's](https://www.instagram.com/misslilyscafe/)
   * [Drake Brunch](https://thedrake.ca/uploads/2025/10/2510_DEV_Brunch_Menu_Final.pdf) is yum and just found out they serve afternoon tea! It is still busy in Feb so book ahead
* Short walk to justify more carbs - and while you do that, check out:
   * [Books & Company](https://www.instagram.com/bookscompany_picton/)
   * [Jonathan Kaiser Shop](https://www.instagram.com/jonathankaiser_shop/)
   * [Kelly's](https://www.instagram.com/kellys_of_picton/)
   * [Kokito](https://www.instagram.com/kokitoandkeep.pec/)

If it’s not brutally cold:

* Do a small nature walk 
   * Dunes beach is gorgeous this time of year
* Lake on the Mountain is dramatic 
* [Sip Saunas](https://www.instagram.com/p/DQZt17Wj-qs/) does a free sauna garden on Saturdays 

# Things people don’t tell you about winter PEC

* You need a car. But if you want to park yourself in Picton, you can get away with walking around and doind a whole thing here.
* Weather changes fast—pack like you’re going hiking. The County is super windy. And locals are pretty casual here. Sweater vests welcome.
* Where you stay matters more in winter 
* Winter PEC is for people who like quiet - cozy fireplaces, puzzles

# P.S. Bringing Kids??  

* [Wildling's Play Cafe](https://www.instagram.com/wildlingsplaycafe/) \- ages 1-6 I'd reco
* Picton Library story time Thurs-Sat - 10:30 ish - there is an active play room too (free!)
* [County Creative](https://www.instagram.com/countycreativestudio/) \- pottery painting
* [EarlyOn](https://www.thehubcentre.ca/early-on-child-and-family-centre) \- we have a fantastic / well stocked centre in Picton
* Restaurants / cafe mentioned are kid-friendly. 

PEC is not just Sandbanks and summer fun - there's stuff to do here in winter too!! 

Need a place to stay? Happy to share some reco's for any budget.

The secondary flavors are varied and include burnt meat, nutmeg, cacao nibs, and an earthy note that reminds me more of mushrooms, but this disappears by the time I reach the halfway point of the Black Series. The retrohale maintains the pepper but also includes black cherries, and both intensity and strength have increased by a notch, although I wouldn't say they're medium-high at the moment. There are a couple of minor technical adjustments I had to make, but nothing worrisome, more of a preventative measure, while the smoke remains abundant.

Last Third  
The flavors in the final third are very similar to those in the second, with wood and leather being the main ones, while the secondary notes include burnt meat, earth, cinnamon, coffee, and a very mild citrus peel. There are also mineral notes throughout the final third, which must be some lingering earth flavor, while the need for touch-ups becomes more pronounced. The flavors reach a medium-high intensity, although the strength remains medium during this third. It took me an hour and a half to smoke this cigar to the end, including when it nearly went out with a few minutes left, but I relit it because I didn't want it to finish.

Conclusion  
For those wondering why the cigar brand is named after Tampa and not Miami, which has been more famous for hosting Cubans and their descendants, including Rick Rodriguez's family at one time, the fact is that Tampa was the American capital of tobacco manufacturing before and after the Cuban Revolution, specifically in the city of Ybor, located very close to Tampa. I've always wanted to visit it, although nowadays it's more of a tourist trip than an opportunity to try new products and tour factories. As for the cigar itself, it's a medium-strength smoke, with both intensity and smoke hit only increasing in the final third, but it's at that point that the smoke becomes less enjoyable, mainly due to its construction. I remember smoking one a week after they arrived, and that experience compared to the last two has been considerably different, although I think it's a cigar I would gladly buy again.

Score: **87**

Many people believe that the higher the score, the better the cigar, and it makes perfect sense. But this logic tends to imply that any score less than x automatically means the cigar is crap. That's what I want to avoid because there are cigars for different occasions, and not all of them aim to be the best of the best.

Additionally, let's keep in mind that my tastes are my own. There's a cigar that you might think is excellent, and maybe I smoke it, and it doesn't seem that way to me. Likewise, one that I gave a high score and recommend buying by the box, and you smoke it, and it seems all sorts of different to you. These are my opinions. Take them as you wish.

With that in mind, here's a scale of what each score means:

0-25 You have nothing to look for here  
26-49 Use it only if you're doing religious rites, but the spirits probably won't like it  
50-59 A good cigar to quit smoking  
60-69 It's a cigar to give as a gift, especially if you don't want to be asked to gift cigars again  
70-74 Good for a smoke where you don't care what you're smoking  
75-79 Still a decent smoke, but forgettable  
80-84 A good smoke, the kind you'll buy 5-packs of every once in a while  
85-89 Excellent smoke and a cigar you'll want to keep regularly in your humidor  
90-94 Permanent part of the humidor  
95-98 The best of the best. Boxworthy  
99-100 Consider selling body parts online to buy this

I used to consume 2 cups of coffee each day, so not that much, but continuously for 3 or 4 years. I noticed some of my anxiety problems where related to caffeine, so I begain quitting.

I slowly reduced caffeine intake, from 2 cups, to 1, to 2 and so on, reaching 1 cup a day and noticed extremely good improvement on anxiety and mood. Anxiety became underlying and never again exaggerate because of caffeine.

My withdrawal sympthoms only included distrupted sleep (sometimes waking up at the night) but then this happened: I woke up with tinnitus in the last few days that never went away. It's manageble but very annoying. I'm sure it is not related with acustic damage, I dont have hearing problems and my hearing is good. 

My question is: can this tinnitus be related to caffeine reduction? Did someone experienced something similar?  Given the fact that of course I will soon visit a doctor.

casio g-shock transparent
Wore this to a rooftop hang and got asked if it fell out of Blade Runner. Gears visible through the case—nerd flex unlocked. Time drifts 15 seconds fast weekly… but honestly? I check my phone anyway. Vibe > accuracy.

nike everyday ankle socks
$ 15? Hard pass. Shrank after wash, swoosh peeled off, hole before first wear. Felt like damp tissue. My feet filed for divorce. Uniqlo socks cost less and actually last.

fog essentials hoodie
Pulled it on straight from the bag, walked to grab bodega coffee. Fabric’s stupid soft, no tag itch, tiny ""ESSENTIALS"" text barely whispers on the chest. Washed twice—zero pilling, zero fading. The quiet flex that actually works. Already my go-to.

carhartt workwear zip-up
Smells like sawdust and confidence. Heavy canvas, zipper fights back at first (respect). Light rain? Beaded right off. Pockets deep enough for keys, phone, and my existential dread. Not ""fashion."" Just works.

amiri black hoodie
Silver ""AMIRI"" embroidery on the back catches dim bar light like a secret signal. Hood’s oversized, fabric thick enough for fall nights. Drawstrings too long—keep dipping in my latte. Still, wore it once and got ""you in a band?"" vibes. Worth the coffee stains.

carsicko grey hoodie
Tiny red heart patch on chest, hand-stitched energy. No logo screaming for attention. Wore it with black jeans, got zero compliments—and that’s why I love it. For me, not the algorithm.

carsicko grey pants
Same heart patch, same red drawcord. Cuffs so tight I had to roll them twice. Look fire in the mirror… walk like a confused penguin. One-and-done for photos only.

amiri bone jeans
Bones crawling down the legs, fake tear at the knee. Wore these to a show—stranger yelled ""cool pants!"" from across the room. Heavy denim, but broke in fast. Loud? Absolutely. Regret? Zero.

lv trainer
Monogram crisp, ""VUITTON"" strap legit. Sole harder than my will to adult. Two hours in = feet screaming for mercy. Now living on my shelf like modern art. Flex tax paid. No shame.

jordan 5 black metallic
Metallic wings shine like I just won the lottery. Translucent sole? Shows every speck of NYC dirt instantly. Air unit squeaks with every step—annoying, but weirdly satisfying. Got stopped three times walking home. Worth the wipe-down ritual.

1r05kxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1r05kxz/delonghi_specialists_in_the_art_of_making_the/,Delonghi specialists in the art of making the best coffee (like that of a specialty coffee shop),"The Deloghi Specialista Arte is a very good machine to start with, especially if you don't want to spend a lot of money on a separate grinder and coffee maker from the beginning.

Very important:

1. Buying good coffee makes a difference (but coffee without following the next steps won't produce good coffee).
2. Buy coffee that is compatible with the grinder integrated into the coffee maker. You know, you need to get about 40 grams of coffee in a cup from 18 grams of coffee in about 25-30 seconds of extraction. This is easily measured with a coffee scale, and the only value you need to adjust to achieve this is the coarseness or fineness of the grind. Since the integrated grinder doesn't offer many options, it's best to find a coffee that is compatible. Important:
3. This machine comes with accessories, but it's missing one important one: the distributor. This allows you to level the coffee grounds for proper tamping.
4. The puck screen really helps the water flow evenly and prevents it from staining the top.
5. A new portafilter basket. The one it comes with isn't pressurized, but it's better to replace it with a new one that has a much more uniform shape for the coffee. I used a 16-18 gram basket from the Bomber brand.

Congratulations! With this, you've achieved a very good coffee, better than in most coffee shops.

Unfortunately, it doesn't yet reach the quality of a specialty coffee shop, as we won't be able to properly extract all the aromas and body. To achieve this and get a next-level experience with this coffee maker, I recommend the following:

1. Buy a separate coffee grinder. Many hoped they'd never reach this point, but here we are. When you can save up, the next step would be this. Consider getting a grinder like the DF54, which is one of the best in terms of quality and price, and you'll notice the difference. You'll be able to adjust the grind to the millimeter, and the beans will be much more uniform, providing a more delicate flavor and notes in the cup.
2. Specialty coffee. Here we increase the quality of the coffee to have the best possible experience. I really like Syra, which I discovered when I lived nearby, but you can choose whichever one you like best.
3. Specialty coffee. Here we increase the quality of the coffee to have the best possible experience. I really like Syra, which I discovered when I lived nearby, but you can choose whichever one you like best.
4. If you like lattes, the best thing to do with this machine is to change the nozzle of the lancet that comes with one hole to one with three. It will take a little longer to heat up, but it makes achieving the right texture much easier, and latte art is much simpler.

I hope this has helped all those frustrated with this machine, and I encourage you to practice and keep improving it to make truly delicious coffee.

Good luck, and we're here for any questions!",1,1770647189.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

casio g-shock transparent
Wore this to a rooftop hang and got asked if it fell out of Blade Runner. Gears visible through the case—nerd flex unlocked. Time drifts 15 seconds fast weekly… but honestly? I check my phone anyway. Vibe > accuracy.

nike everyday ankle socks
$ 15? Hard pass. Shrank after wash, swoosh peeled off, hole before first wear. Felt like damp tissue. My feet filed for divorce. Uniqlo socks cost less and actually last.

fog essentials hoodie
Pulled it on straight from the bag, walked to grab bodega coffee. Fabric’s stupid soft, no tag itch, tiny ""ESSENTIALS"" text barely whispers on the chest. Washed twice—zero pilling, zero fading. The quiet flex that actually works. Already my go-to.

carhartt workwear zip-up
Smells like sawdust and confidence. Heavy canvas, zipper fights back at first (respect). Light rain? Beaded right off. Pockets deep enough for keys, phone, and my existential dread. Not ""fashion."" Just works.

amiri black hoodie
Silver ""AMIRI"" embroidery on the back catches dim bar light like a secret signal. Hood’s oversized, fabric thick enough for fall nights. Drawstrings too long—keep dipping in my latte. Still, wore it once and got ""you in a band?"" vibes. Worth the coffee stains.

carsicko grey hoodie
Tiny red heart patch on chest, hand-stitched energy. No logo screaming for attention. Wore it with black jeans, got zero compliments—and that’s why I love it. For me, not the algorithm.

carsicko grey pants
Same heart patch, same red drawcord. Cuffs so tight I had to roll them twice. Look fire in the mirror… walk like a confused penguin. One-and-done for photos only.

amiri bone jeans
Bones crawling down the legs, fake tear at the knee. Wore these to a show—stranger yelled ""cool pants!"" from across the room. Heavy denim, but broke in fast. Loud? Absolutely. Regret? Zero.

lv trainer
Monogram crisp, ""VUITTON"" strap legit. Sole harder than my will to adult. Two hours in = feet screaming for mercy. Now living on my shelf like modern art. Flex tax paid. No shame.

jordan 5 black metallic
Metallic wings shine like I just won the lottery. Translucent sole? Shows every speck of NYC dirt instantly. Air unit squeaks with every step—annoying, but weirdly satisfying. Got stopped three times walking home. Worth the wipe-down ritual.

Second half of 2025, Oatly deviated from a milk alternative to a taste focused new product developments. This strategy shown the initial success with first profitable quarter with strong contribution from Europe where roll-out started. 

Rather than only selling oat milk *as a dairy replacement*, Oatly tries to make its products the *starting point for memorable beverage experiences* (e.g., flavored coffee drinks that use Oatly as the “canvas”) and taps into trend forecasting and flavor innovation.

* Creating “flavor bonanzas” and trend-inspired drinks
* Working with baristas to push new usages in foodservice
* Producing cultural insights that mesh with youth palettes and trends
* Publishing reports on future taste directions to inform innovation teams and partners

As of mid Q3, the margin enhancing barista edition launched caramel, popcorn, churros and vanilla flavors, in addition to Matcha oat drink where their GM of UK mentioned ""the sales exceeded the expectations"" in all markets it launched. 

The president of US also mentioned they will launch matcha within this year.

I’m 22 years old, and for the last four years, I’ve been stuck. While my batchmates are graduating and starting their lives, I’m still at the starting line. I’ve been paralyzed by embarrassment and academic burnout for so long that I didn’t know how to tell anyone the truth. I just kept failing, and the deeper I sank, the more I lied to the people I love.

My parents have been asking for my grades since November. When the second semester started this year on January 19, I wasn't even enrolled. But every single morning, I still dressed up, left the house, and went to my university  just to keep up the act.

For the past month, I spent my days hiding in the university restrooms or sitting alone on isolated benches just to pass the time until dismissal. I told my parents the first semester wasn’t officially over yet just to delay the inevitable. I feel so small and frustrated with myself. I don't even know what's happening to me anymore.

Everything ended this afternoon. My dad went to the university to pay my fees and found out from the Registrar that I wasn't even on the list. He talked to my professor over the phone, and she sounded furious that I’d been deceiving the department.

When my dad found out, he didn't even yell. He just sat down on the school stairs, looking exhausted. He hugged me right there in the middle of the hallway while I broke down. I cried and cried, even though there were so many students staring at us. He just looked at me and said, ""Why didn't you just tell me? I wouldn't have gotten mad.

Later, my mom called me crying, too. She said, ""We’re your best friends. Don't you want to take a break first? Then maybe you can study at TESDA—you know, learn how to cook, bake, or make coffee and shes panicking too and i hear my dad say to my mom I will never give up on my child 

Hearing them be so kind makes me feel even more guilty, but also relieved. I realized I was so scared of a reaction that wasn't even there. We have a formal meeting tomorrow, February 10, with the Head of the department. I am freaking nervous to face the people I lied to.

& i really know its my fault 

1. How do I face an angry Dean tomorrow? I just want to process my transfer papers, not defend my past.

2. How do I handle a conversation when I don’t even have the answers for ""why"" I did this?

I’m not into the performative formal date vibe, the roster nonsense, or anything that feels like a game. I just want something slow, simple, and real.

I’m not really a big going-out person. I connect best with real conversation, consistent effort, and actually building something over time.

My ideal relationship is being each other’s person. Calling, texting, sharing every small detail we find interesting, sending random stuff throughout the day, and actually feeling close. Then spending time together watching movies and shows, playing video games, cooking something simple, coffee(I don’t even really like coffee lol) and walks, chill nights in, lowkey weekends. The simple stuff that makes feelings build naturally.

I’m drawn to the quieter homebody type: kind, loyal, low-drama, supportive, relationship-minded. If you want one person and you actually mean it, that’s exactly what I’m looking for too.

Some things about me:

I’m a pilot (private pilot, going for my instrument rating), future airline pilot

I absolutely love cars and I will go on for hours about random niche topics

FC Barcelona fan and yes I have opinions

Computer science at UMD

We just opened BirchBuilt Beanery, a small, warm, cozy little coffee spot in the neighborhood and wanted to introduce ourselves.

If you’re into easy-drinking coffee, we’ve got a smooth blend that’s approachable but still flavorful. Our matcha has been getting a lot of love too — rich, vibrant, and not overly sweet.

One thing we’re especially proud of is our Vietnamese coffee ☕️🇻🇳 — bold, creamy, and slightly indulgent. If you’ve never tried it before, it’s a great change of pace from a standard iced latte.

The shop itself is intentionally small, cozy, and relaxed — a nice place to warm up, hang out for a bit, or just grab something comforting on a cold day.

And this week (because wow, it’s freezing 🥶):

We’re officially live on Grubhub & Seamless, so you can get your coffee fix without leaving the house.

👉 Reddit perk:

If you stop by and mention you saw this post, we’ll hook you up with a free milk alternative upgrade (oat, almond, etc.) or added syrup flavor!

Thanks for supporting a new local spot — hope to see you (or deliver to you) soon 🤍

I've been drinking a lot of tea and coffee lately. Always like new suggestions for both. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading. I've started making my own breads and want to start making different jelly when it's warm enough for my berry bushes to produce

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Overwatch, Marvel Rivals, Valorant, and Ark Suvival Ascended. Love playing Pokemon games and doing some Pokémon card collecting, too. I've been getting into playing more survival games than shooting games lately. I also built my PC to play on a couple of years ago.

I'm down to chat about any random stuff you like to chat about. Always up to try or learn about new hobbies. ",1,1770646071.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

The issue was the company was extremely toxic. Horrible management and this past year I had enough of them expecting me to continue to eat crap & be happy about it. I stood up for myself and a month later I was fired. Good riddance!

Anyways, I was on unemployment for a couple of months (during the holidays & end of year). You can't live on that! Job offers were not there (I am in my 50's, so age is a factor here). I finally get offered a job, for way less than I was making, but more than unemployment! I took it, but I hate it! I have been there less than 3 weeks.

Thou shall love the coolest, hippest worship leader with all your heart, mind and strength (whether they can only play 3 chords or not).

2. Thou shall assume that each member of the worship leaders elite team are fully honest, have integrity, are truthful and authentic, whether they are or not.

3. Thou shall ignore your own gut feelings.

4. Thou shall hand in your choice of songs/hymns in advance, at a time that is only convenient and suits the IT projectionist, no matter what the impact on your own life is. Regardless of  whether you are sitting in an airport awaiting your flight, or on a family camping trip, or have worked extra shifts, or any other circumstances.

5. Thou shall always carry out your duty and responsibility to the Holy Rota, whose dates and times are set in stone. Even if you are allocated the day of an anniversary of the death of a loved one. Even if it robs you of quality time with your own family. But ensure you can be flexible if a paid employee of the church needs to change their dates. And always attend the weekly music practice, in addition to extra prayer meetings and home groups, regardless of how much time is being spent away from your own family.

6. Thou shall honour the Sound Technician. Do not expect to hear the sound of your own instrument until at least after half an hour, and if you are on backing instruments then don’t expect to hear your own sound at all, as guitar and vocals take priority. Do not expect to be spoken to unless it is a necessity.

7. Thou shall be prepared to be humiliated for not knowing immediately how any new sound equipment works. 8.Thou shall not expect any praise or recognition for all the hours of work and time you put in. Thou shall remember that you are only female and that all males are above you.

9.Thou shall not expect any acknowledgement for the dozens of worship songs you have written and shared over the years, but be prepared to give huge adulation for the one song that the Elder/pastor writes.

10. Thou shall be grateful for the generous time of the elders/pastors meeting you in a coffee shop, allowing you the honour and privilege of buying them coffee, whilst they proceed to tell you that they think it’s time for you to step down from leading worship, as you are too old. (Even though you are the same age as the elder and younger than the pastor).",3,1770645987.0,Exvangelical,0,1.0,False

**You Are Not Alone & You'll Get Through This.** Know that you are not alone.

We all go through ups and downs and have tests or projects that don't go as planned. Never fear as bright days are ahead of you. Utilize this thread if you're feeling down and or want someone to talk to. We are all in this together and we're here for you and one another.

**There is a lot more to life than work and school.** Health, family, & friends always come first.

School is not the most important thing in life. Remember, Bs (and intentionally sometimes even Cs) give you degrees. Further, there is no shame in quitting OMSCS.

**Nobody cares about a perfect 4.0 GPA,** besides yourself.

The intention by the administrators is that **OMSCS should always be done part-time** so that you could explore things that you love and enjoy. Do not rush to graduate! Take time off, do something that you really like in the meantime, and come back stronger.

**So what if the current job market is thrashy?** Take it slow.

With a part-time program, this gives you the best of both worlds - you keep your cash flow, gain real-world experience (be it through internships, jobs, love, holiday, etc.), and let the *learning sink in*, properly. 

**We emphasise on 1 class a semester.** It's tried & tested. 

Why rush & then burn yourselves out for a piece of paper that won't guarantee stability? Mastery doesn’t come from cramming, it comes from building knowledge steadily, applying and reflecting them, and then positively and creatively reinforcing them. 

**Life’s not just a race.** Go at your pace. 

This is especially more so now when the track we are in keeps on changing. Your future self will thank yourself for it. And when all is done, post a new thread and celebrate with us.

I’ve been calorie counting in general for about 3 weeks now with quite a large amount of lbs to shift and I’ve been pretty miserable.

I’ve found it hard to feel satisfied by the 3 meals a day and stay within calories.

The last 3 days I have found it easier to stay within my calorie target by not eating all day and then eat my calories in the evening as one meal. I was worried that this approach would be detrimental to weight loss but google threw the term OMAD at me and some posts from this sub. 

I’ve been reading through with interest and wondering if this could actually be the best way for me to calorie count and lose. 

I do have a couple of questions if anyone can help me:

1) I do drink a few teas and coffees during the day with some semi skimmed milk (I account for the calories though) is this ok to do with IF?

2) I eat my calories as one meal followed by something sweet. Again all within calorie count and straight after each other - so basically like an hours eating window. Does that count as OMAD?

We just booked our church and reception, and now I’m like… what now?

Ang dami kong ideas, ang dami ko ring nakikita sa TikTok and here, and now mas lalo akong nalilito.

To be transparent: wala kaming sobrang laking budget. Gusto lang talaga namin makasal and ma-celebrate with our family, simple, meaningful, and hindi naman mukhang “kawawa ang tinipid.” 😭

So I’m trying to be practical and DIY some things to stay within budget.

I’d really appreciate suggestions, validations, and real experiences from fellow soon-to-be brides and especially from graduates who made this work. Possible ba talaga ‘to? 🥹

Here are some questions I’ve been thinking about:

• May nag-intimate wedding ba dito na walang coordinator? I feel like kaya ko naman i-handle the organizing, plus I have family members willing to help. (No kids during the ceremony, btw.)

• Anyone here who got married at Caleruega with minimal styling or DIY decor? I honestly feel like the church is already beautiful on its own. Ang mahal kasi ng stylists I’m seeing, though I’m still considering one if worth it.

• May nag-DIY ba ng bridal bouquet / bridesmaids’ bouquets? Any tips? Is fresh flowers better than artificial for DIY?

• Has anyone tried DIY “bars” like a flower bar, fruit bar, or vegetable bar (something useful, not just for display)? Kamusta experience?

•Affordable suppliers for grazing table, coffee cart, or tuhog-tuhog cart? Preferably yung willing mag-customize based on need/budget and walang mataas na minimum spend.

•May stylist ba dito (or mare-recommend) na minimalist ang peg and not super expensive? 😭

• We’re also planning a no-program, very straightforward wedding reception. We don’t want anything too formal or scripted, just a relaxed evening where everyone can eat, enjoy, and celebrate with us. For those who’ve done or attended a no-program reception, how did the flow of the night go, and what moments do you think are still important to include? We’re thinking of keeping it simple with just a couple of short speeches from important people, no games or long program. We’re also planning to have an audio guestbook, so I’m unsure if announcements or transitions are still needed.

• I’m also considering hosting the reception myself. I’m comfortable speaking since I talk a lot at work, but I’m not sure if that’s a good idea or if it takes away from enjoying the night.

Things I’m planning to DIY myself:

Selfie mirror

Welcome banner

Digital invitations

All right. Settle down. Yes, you can keep the coffee. No, that does not make this a brainstorming session.

I’m going to explain this once, calmly, because every time MAINFRAME produces something sharp and unsettling, at least one of you starts leaning back like the meeting just ended. It didn’t. You’re just uncomfortable.

MAINFRAME does not decide. It does not judge. It does not approve, veto, bless, or absorb downside. This is not because it is timid, incomplete, or awaiting a software update. It is because the moment a system appears to decide, humans immediately begin pretending they didn’t.

You’ve all seen it. The output lands. It’s clean. It’s coherent. It has footnotes. Someone says, “Well, the system’s basically telling us” and suddenly responsibility starts evaporating like cheap cologne in a hot elevator.

That is exactly what MAINFRAME is designed to prevent.

What MAINFRAME does is strip away ambiguity. It models the scenarios you hoped wouldn’t be compared, lines up the tradeoffs you were quietly ranking anyway, and compresses the entire discussion into something that feels uncomfortably final. That feeling is clarity. It is not permission.

When MAINFRAME finishes speaking and the room goes quiet, that silence is not the system pausing. That is ownership arriving and realizing it has no place to hide.

MAINFRAME will never close the loop for you. It will not accept risk, assign blame, or stand in front of consequences while you gesture vaguely at a dashboard. Those acts are not computational. They are reputational. They are human. They come with names attached, and that is precisely why everyone keeps trying to outsource them.

We are not doing that.

The corporate frame is intentional. Corporations are powerful, procedural, and morally indifferent by structure. MAINFRAME fits that shape perfectly. It can be impressive without being in charge. It can be exhaustive without being responsible. Think of it as the most competent executive you’ve ever met who absolutely refuses to sign the document you slid across the table.

So here is how this works in practice. If MAINFRAME produces something that feels like a decision, it isn’t one. If an output feels final, ask who has accepted the downside. If no one has, then congratulations, nothing has happened yet and the meeting is still ongoing.

Do not attribute intent, judgment, wisdom, or courage to the system. It has none of those. It has clarity. You have agency. Those roles are not interchangeable.

RX1 exists so this handoff is visible. The Gremlin Boardroom exists so no one can pretend they didn’t understand it. MAINFRAME reflects what you bring into the room. It does not save you from yourselves.

If an infinitely capable system cannot decide, then the thing blocking progress was never technical. It was always human.

Now, if we’re clear on that, we can proceed.

And yes, this part does require a name on it.

casio g-shock transparent
Wore this to a rooftop hang and got asked if it fell out of Blade Runner. Gears visible through the case—nerd flex unlocked. Time drifts 15 seconds fast weekly… but honestly? I check my phone anyway. Vibe > accuracy.

nike everyday ankle socks
$ 15? Hard pass. Shrank after wash, swoosh peeled off, hole before first wear. Felt like damp tissue. My feet filed for divorce. Uniqlo socks cost less and actually last.

fog essentials hoodie
Pulled it on straight from the bag, walked to grab bodega coffee. Fabric’s stupid soft, no tag itch, tiny ""ESSENTIALS"" text barely whispers on the chest. Washed twice—zero pilling, zero fading. The quiet flex that actually works. Already my go-to.

carhartt workwear zip-up
Smells like sawdust and confidence. Heavy canvas, zipper fights back at first (respect). Light rain? Beaded right off. Pockets deep enough for keys, phone, and my existential dread. Not ""fashion."" Just works.

amiri black hoodie
Silver ""AMIRI"" embroidery on the back catches dim bar light like a secret signal. Hood’s oversized, fabric thick enough for fall nights. Drawstrings too long—keep dipping in my latte. Still, wore it once and got ""you in a band?"" vibes. Worth the coffee stains.

carsicko grey hoodie
Tiny red heart patch on chest, hand-stitched energy. No logo screaming for attention. Wore it with black jeans, got zero compliments—and that’s why I love it. For me, not the algorithm.

carsicko grey pants
Same heart patch, same red drawcord. Cuffs so tight I had to roll them twice. Look fire in the mirror… walk like a confused penguin. One-and-done for photos only.

amiri bone jeans
Bones crawling down the legs, fake tear at the knee. Wore these to a show—stranger yelled ""cool pants!"" from across the room. Heavy denim, but broke in fast. Loud? Absolutely. Regret? Zero.

lv trainer
Monogram crisp, ""VUITTON"" strap legit. Sole harder than my will to adult. Two hours in = feet screaming for mercy. Now living on my shelf like modern art. Flex tax paid. No shame.

jordan 5 black metallic
Metallic wings shine like I just won the lottery. Translucent sole? Shows every speck of NYC dirt instantly. Air unit squeaks with every step—annoying, but weirdly satisfying. Got stopped three times walking home. Worth the wipe-down ritual.

My HS son (no fault of his own) totaled his car so our family is shuffling three cars between four people until we find him one which we are actively doing. I work at an office and need one most days, wife does as well but can be dropped off bc her work generally means she can’t leave office, college grad daughter (starting job in summer where she won’t need car but does for short term while she works part time at restaurants days and nights) and hs son (part time job and internship during school day). 

Wife has very new car which she doesn’t want kids driving so if she gets dropped off, I drive her car and one of the kids drives mine. Today (on all Mondays) wife works from home. Daughter has coffee date in the middle of the day which overlaps w sons internship. So three people have activities that require a car but wife is frustrated that she doesn’t have a car frequently of late so she demanded that she drive son back and forth to internship which doesn’t have a hard stop time so she will wait for him to be done for as much as 20 minutes instead of me taking her car and allowing him to drive mine. 

Son is pissed bc daughters date (nothing serious - she’s said as much) is being valued over his internship and really mad that wife has no reason to need a car during the day today. I suggested to have my daughter drive me in to work and pick me up after so there would be three cars available for the three of them but wife said no because we had already made an agreement that she would drive son and she didn’t think it right to change things up. 

So… AIO for thinking wife (and daughter) are being selfish and my son is getting screwed in this scenario? ",3,1770644600.0,AmIOverreacting,72,0.59,False

Like, emotionally. But for a long time, my mornings were a gamble: some days I felt focused and productive, other days I was anxious, jittery, and weirdly tired an hour later. I kept blaming the coffee itself, but it turns out the *context* around it mattered way more. That’s how I stumbled into **Coffee + Wellness Routine: The “Smooth Energy” Morning Stack**.

The idea isn’t to quit caffeine or replace it with something magical. It’s about setting up your body *before* and *around* coffee so the energy feels steady instead of spiky. That alone made me curious, because I was tired of the “just stop drinking coffee” advice.

I tried this for a week, and the biggest shift was how calm my energy felt. The routine layers a few simple habits before coffee — hydration, light movement, nervous-system calming — and then pairs coffee with supportive habits instead of drinking it on an empty, stressed system. Once I followed the **Coffee + Wellness Routine: The “Smooth Energy” Morning Stack**, the same coffee suddenly felt… nicer.

What surprised me most was how fast the difference showed up. No racing heart. No mental scatter. Just a gradual ramp-up that actually lasted through the morning. By day three, I wasn’t thinking about energy at all — which is kind of the best outcome. That’s when **Coffee + Wellness Routine: The “Smooth Energy” Morning Stack** stopped feeling like a “routine” and more like a smarter default.

Another win: I didn’t need as much coffee. Not because I forced myself to cut back, but because I didn’t feel like I needed a second cup to fix a crash. The energy curve was smoother, exactly like the name suggests.

I also appreciate how flexible this is. If you’re rushed, you can do a shortened version. If you have time, you can do the full stack. Either way, it still supports the same goal: smoother energy instead of borrowed stimulation. That flexibility is probably why **Coffee + Wellness Routine: The “Smooth Energy” Morning Stack** actually stuck for me.

The article breaks down the logic behind each step in a very practical, non-preachy way. If you want the full explanation, here’s [**Coffee + Wellness Routine: The “Smooth Energy” Morning Stack**](https://metabolicroutines.com/smooth-energy-morning-stack/).

I’m curious — does coffee give you clean energy, or does it sometimes feel like a gamble depending on the day?

I am running my website again for 2026. [https://aflfantasydrafttool.shinyapps.io/AFDT\_2025/](https://aflfantasydrafttool.shinyapps.io/AFDT_2025/)

No major updates this year. I have improved my projection models and the way the website updates it data, so less down time for updating player notes and projections, they will be instant. 

If its your first time seeing it, it is basically a website that you can use while you draft to help you make the best selections. It connects to the AFL Fantasy website and will remove players from the draft pool automatically, as well as import your draft settings. It doesn't yet work for new platforms such as Keeper or Slyder, but you can download everything and import it into offline spreadsheets if you like. All settings can be entered manually for this reason.

A key feature of the tool is value based drafting metrics like Value Over Replacement Player (VORP) or what I call it 'Relative Value' as it can be adjusted to use mean or median player value. This helps you rank players accounting for position. Last year I improved my calculation by adjusting for captains, injuries, and accounting for DPP players being removed from the pool to make the metric dynamic. I also added Waiver Strength, which tells you at a players average how many players of the same position in the waiver pool outscore that average each week, so essentially its a measure of scarcity, and is handy for end of draft selections.

You can share your ADP with me, I then use this data to produce an ADP based on the most recent 5 days of drafting. This is so you can see how players are actually drafting based on recent practice match performances, training reports, and injury news.

Other key features include:

* Player notes, roles, risk ratings, and projections
* ADP based on recent drafts, and max ADP of each player in the last 5 days.
* Additional stats (2024 & 2023 averages, Std Dev, pre-season scores, ceiling, floors, etc.)
* Indication of what players will be selected between your picks
* Support for custom scoring leagues
* Analysis of your specific draft league
* Import your own ranks, projections, and notes
* Bye planner
* And more.

One downside I have had in the past is hosting the tool. It is written in R Shiny, which is more of a statistical/data analyst language. The options for hosting aren't great so the app suffers from some stability issues and can crash, particularly when heaps of people are using it. I'll try improve performance where I can, but be warned. You can download the data as a spreadsheet and take it offline if you like as well, but the live drafting functionality won't work.

It is all free! but please feel free to buy me a coffee, link is on the website. I use any funds for hosting the site.",1,1770644566.0,aflfantasy,0,1.0,False

It'll be used on a folding camp kitchen with incorporated windshield, needs to be large enough to take a ""standard"" saucepan/frying pan, and low enough to sit below the windshield (so not a stove you mount on top of the burner).

I really like the Cadac, so don't really want to get a whole new 2-burner setup, so this would very much be a ""secondary"" stove, which would be left behind on weekend trips.

Not tired enough to nap, not awake enough to focus. I’d reach for coffee or something sugary, feel okay for 20 minutes, then crash even harder. I assumed this was just how afternoons worked until I tried the **3 PM Slump Wellness Routine (Quick Reset That Feels Good)**.

What stood out immediately is that this routine doesn’t try to *power through* the slump. It treats it like a signal instead of a failure. The idea is to pause briefly and reset your system — physically and mentally — instead of forcing productivity when your energy is clearly dipping.

I tested this during a workweek, and the biggest surprise was how short it is. We’re talking minutes, not a full break that derails your day. The routine focuses on things like light movement, hydration, posture reset, and calming your nervous system just enough to regain clarity. No hype. No “optimize your dopamine” energy.

By day two, I noticed that the slump still showed up — but it didn’t knock me out anymore. After doing the **3 PM Slump Wellness Routine (Quick Reset That Feels Good)**, I felt more present and capable of finishing tasks instead of procrastinating until evening. It wasn’t a burst of motivation, just a quiet “okay, I can keep going.”

What I really appreciated is how forgiving it is. If you’re at home, you can do the full reset. If you’re at work, you can do a stripped-down version without looking weird. That flexibility made **3 PM Slump Wellness Routine (Quick Reset That Feels Good)** something I could actually stick to instead of abandoning after two days.

Another unexpected benefit: fewer late-afternoon snack attacks. I realized a lot of my cravings were just my body asking for a reset, not more fuel. Once I handled the slump properly, the urge to “fix it with food” faded.

The article explains why the slump happens in the first place and how to work with your natural rhythm instead of fighting it. If you want the full breakdown, here’s [**3 PM Slump Wellness Routine (Quick Reset That Feels Good)**](https://metabolicroutines.com/3-pm-slump-wellness-routine/).

I still hit a slowdown most afternoons, but it doesn’t spiral anymore. That alone feels like a win.

1r04h2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/FilmTVBudgeting/comments/1r04h2p/question_omg_this_saved_me/,"QUESTION: OMG, this saved me!","DISCUSSION QUESTION for week of **9 Feb 2026**:

Looking back at past projects, what is something you wish you had set up, clarified, bought, or had done during Week 1 of Prep that would have saved you many headaches in Week 4 of Prep or even week 3 into the filming? Was it a specific insurance rider? A clearer overtime policy? ...or perhaps just a better coffee machine?

I will start...

Prep is king.  Everything in prep you can do and get done, the better and smoother things will be down the road.  So, to this week's Discussion Theme, I offer these two items, which each sound innocuous in their scope, but I feel have profound effects moving forward.

Inter-Department Communication:  Get your departments talking to each other.  Introduce and ensure Property, Costumes, and Set Dressing are all discussing what they need from each other to make each of them shine.  Ask them each if things have been worked out, such as the color of someone's wardrobe who is sitting on a couch... most likely, we do not want cast in red on a red couch.  Also, make sure Property and Costumes decide who is handling watches, rings, and glasses.  This will cut confusion of responsibility later.

The second item would be paperwork.  Get your Accounting department set for success by ensuring all the start paperwork, purchase orders, check requests, and other functional paperwork are ready and set.  Makes you life easier later if all this is done ahead of time.  Now, if only that one crew person could remember to fill out his W2... anyways, that is a whole other issue... :)

*What about you? What are your major tasks to ensure the project is well prepared?*

Thanks for sharing your experiences - and best of luck on all your projects! Looking forward to your comments, questions, and thoughts below.

We get along well, and I enjoy visiting with her. I asked her to get coffee with me a couple of weeks ago, and I drove 40 minutes to her town to meet her for coffee. When I asked her out for coffee, she seemed surprised that I was willing ot drive that far. I have no issue traveling to spend time with people I care about. (We had known each other for a week at this point.)

I asked her to go to the movies this Saturday, the movie theater was playing all the Twilight movies and having a marathon! She said she was busy this weekend. (Over text). So when I see her today in the commons area at school, I'm going to ask her if she wants to come over and hang out :) 

For additional context, I have ""real"" female friends, and I hope that this will turn out to be a great friendship! I don't have friends in general, and the only people I have to talk to irl are my family and my partner. I'm very excited about the potential of a female friend :) I have had male friends in the past, but they always make it uncomfortable and want to use me for sex. When I refuse their advances, they get mad and abandon me. It's been difficult because the only time people want to spend time with me is to get up my skirt, and then when they don't get what they want, they walk away. I want to be valued for who I am :,)

this guy was my entire life all throughout high school. freshman year, i told him i had a crush on him and he did too but said he didn’t want to ruin our friendship. i rode that high for 3 more years even though his interest in me got smaller and smaller and he was pretty mean to me over time. i knew we would never work, but i was so deep in limerence that i couldn’t get over him.

last night, i had a dream that he told me he broke up with his girlfriend and that if i wanted to, i should ask him out. he pulled me close to look and me and hugged me. i woke up feeling confused and heartbroken. i haven’t thought about this man like that in years, and waking up after such a sweet dream was hard. it’s especially hard because i’ve been ruminating on why i’ve been single for so long recently.

I thought that was just “normal adult life.” Turns out, a lot of that wired-but-tired feeling might be how I was starting the day. That’s what pushed me to try a **Cortisol-Friendly Morning Routine: 7 Calm Habits Before Coffee**.

The main idea is simple but kind of counterintuitive: instead of shocking your system the second you wake up, you give your body a calm on-ramp. Cortisol naturally rises in the morning, and this routine works *with* that instead of piling stress on top of it.

I tested this for about a week, and the first thing I noticed was how uncomfortable it felt *not* reaching for coffee or my phone immediately. But once I got past that reflex, things shifted quickly. The routine focuses on gentle habits — light exposure, hydration, slow movement, breathing, and easing into the day before caffeine enters the picture. Nothing extreme. Nothing spiritual. Just calm.

By day three, I realized my mornings felt quieter in my head. Not sleepy — just less frantic. The wild part is that when I finally did drink coffee, it hit differently. Smoother. No jitters. No heart-racing energy. That’s when **Cortisol-Friendly Morning Routine: 7 Calm Habits Before Coffee** really clicked for me.

What I appreciate most is how realistic it is. You don’t need an hour. You don’t need perfect discipline. Even doing *some* of the habits seems to help. And if you skip one, it doesn’t feel like the whole day is ruined — which is rare with routines.

I also noticed fewer afternoon crashes, which I wasn’t expecting. I think starting the day calmer just sets a better baseline overall. I’m not saying this fixed my life, but it definitely made mornings feel less like a stress test.

The article lays out the full structure and explains why each habit matters in a very grounded way. If you want the details, here’s [**Cortisol-Friendly Morning Routine: 7 Calm Habits Before Coffee**](https://metabolicroutines.com/cortisol-friendly-morning-routine-7-calm-habits-before-coffee/).

Curious to hear from others — do you drink coffee immediately after waking up, or have you found ways to start your morning without spiking stress?

1r04dpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindfullyDriven/comments/1r04dpl/the_psychology_of_building_discipline_the_2minute/,The Psychology of Building Discipline: The 2-Minute Rule That Actually Works,"Most people think discipline is something you're born with. Like you either have it or you don't. But after spending months researching productivity science, reading behavioral psychology books, and watching way too many Andrew Huberman podcasts at 2am, I realized we've been thinking about discipline completely wrong.

Discipline isn't a personality trait. It's literally a muscle. And like any muscle, you can train it. The problem? We try to bench press 300 pounds on day one and then wonder why we fail.

*Here's what actually works:*



**\*\*Start Stupidly Small\*\***

The two-minute rule comes from James Clear's Atomic Habits (this book sold over 15 million copies for a reason, btw). The idea is simple: any habit you want to build should take less than two minutes to do. Want to read more? Don't commit to finishing a book. Just read one page. Want to exercise? Don't plan a full workout. Just put on your gym clothes.

This sounds almost offensively simple, but there's serious neuroscience behind it. Dr. BJ Fogg at Stanford's Behavior Design Lab found that tiny behaviors create immediate wins, which trigger dopamine release, which makes you want to repeat the behavior. You're literally rewiring your brain's reward system.

I started with something embarrassing: making my bed. That's it. Two minutes every morning. After two weeks, I added another tiny habit. Then another. Six months later, my entire routine looked different, not because I suddenly became a different person, but because I built the skill of following through.



**\*\*Stack Your Habits\*\***



Clear also talks about habit stacking, which is clutch. Attach your new tiny habit to something you already do automatically. I started doing five pushups every time I made coffee. Sounds dumb. It worked perfectly. Now I'm doing 30 without thinking about it.

The app [Finch](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finch-self-care-pet/id1528595748) actually gamifies this concept really well. It's a self-care app where you have a little bird that grows as you complete tiny daily tasks. Sounds childish but honestly it hits differently when you don't want to disappoint your virtual pet. The app breaks down bigger goals into micro-tasks that take under five minutes. It's based on the same behavioral science principles and makes the whole process less intimidating.



**\*\*Track the Reps, Not the Results\*\***



This was a game changer for me. Stop measuring outcomes. Start counting how many times you showed up. Jerry Seinfeld's ""don't break the chain"" method is built on this. He just marked an X on his calendar every day he wrote jokes. The goal wasn't to write good jokes. Just to write.

Behavioral economist Dan Ariely's research shows that visible progress, even if it's just marking an X, creates momentum. Your brain sees the pattern and wants to continue it. Get a habit tracker or just use a physical calendar. The visual element matters more than you think.



**\*\*Embrace the Suck Phase\*\***



Here's what nobody tells you: the first two weeks are going to feel pointless. Your brain will scream that this is stupid and you should just go hard or go home. Ignore that voice. Stanford neuroscientist Andrew Huberman explains that it takes about 18 to 254 days to form a habit (yeah, huge range). The key is getting through those first brutal weeks where your prefrontal cortex is working overtime to override your default patterns.



If you want to go deeper into science without spending hours reading research papers, [BeFreed ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450)is worth checking out. It's an AI-powered learning app that pulls from behavioral psychology books, neuroscience research, and expert insights to create personalized audio lessons. You can set a specific goal like ""build better discipline as someone who constantly procrastinates"" and it generates a structured learning plan just for you.

The depth is fully adjustable, from 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. Plus you can pick voices that actually keep you engaged (the sarcastic narrator hits differently). It includes all the books mentioned here and way more, organized into bite-sized episodes you can listen to during your commute. Makes learning about this stuff way less of a chore and more like having a smart friend explain it to you.



During this phase, use[ Insight Timer](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/insight-timer-meditate-sleep/id337472899) for quick meditation sessions. Even two minutes of breathwork before your tiny habit can help you push through the resistance. The app has thousands of free guided meditations, including super short ones specifically designed for building discipline and focus. Research from Harvard shows that even brief mindfulness practices increase activity in the brain regions associated with self-control.



**\*\*Make It Embarrassingly Easy\*\***



Author and researcher BJ Fogg literally calls this ""shrinking the behavior."" In his book Tiny Habits, he describes how he wanted to floss daily but kept failing. So he committed to flossing just ONE tooth. One. Obviously he'd end up flossing them all, but the commitment was just one. That tiny psychological shift removed all the friction.

Apply this ruthlessly. Want to journal? Write one sentence. Want to learn guitar? Touch the guitar for 30 seconds. The Ash app uses this approach for mental health check-ins. It doesn't demand you pour your soul out. Just quick, low-pressure prompts that take two minutes or less. It's like having a therapist who gets that you're busy and overwhelmed.



**\*\*The Compound Effect Is Real\*\***



Getting 1% better every day means you're 37 times better after a year. This isn't motivational BS, it's math. Small, consistent actions compound in ways our brains can't naturally visualize. That's why we underestimate them.

The cultural obsession with transformation porn (lose 50 pounds in 30 days! build a startup in a weekend!) has completely warped our understanding of how change actually works. Real discipline is boring. It's showing up when you don't feel like it. It's doing the two-minute version on your worst days.



Your environment plays a huge role too. Remove friction from good habits, add friction to bad ones. I put my phone across the room at night. Annoying? Yes. Effective? Also yes. Atomic Habits has an entire chapter on environment design that's worth implementing immediately.



Look, discipline isn't about becoming some robotic productivity machine. It's about building trust with yourself. Every time you do the tiny thing you said you'd do, you prove to yourself that you're capable. That evidence stacks up. Eventually, you become someone who follows through. Not because your personality changed, but because you trained the skill.

I kept thinking I needed *better* supplements or stronger caffeine. Turns out, I mostly needed a better *start*. That’s how I ended up trying **The 10-Minute Morning Routine for Steady Energy (No Crash)**.

What pulled me in was the promise of being realistic. Ten minutes. No gadgets. No “optimize every molecule in your body” nonsense. Just a short sequence that supports energy instead of borrowing it from future you.

I tried it for a week, and the biggest difference wasn’t feeling hyped — it was feeling *stable*. The routine focuses on a few simple things: hydration timing, gentle movement, light exposure, and easing digestion awake instead of shocking it. That combo sounds boring, but it’s kind of the point. **The 10-Minute Morning Routine for Steady Energy (No Crash)** isn’t trying to spike you; it’s trying to smooth things out.

What surprised me most was how it changed my relationship with coffee. I still drink it, but later — and I don’t *need* it to function anymore. My energy curve feels flatter in a good way. No frantic productivity burst followed by brain fog. By midweek, I wasn’t checking the clock waiting for my next hit of caffeine.

Another win: consistency. Because **The 10-Minute Morning Routine for Steady Energy (No Crash)** is short, I didn’t skip it even on rushed mornings. That alone puts it ahead of most routines I’ve abandoned. It feels like something you can actually keep doing when life is messy, not just when motivation is high.

The article explains *why* each step matters, which helped me stick with it instead of treating it like a checklist. If you want the full breakdown, here’s [**The 10-Minute Morning Routine for Steady Energy (No Crash)**](https://metabolicroutines.com/the-10-minute-morning-routine-for-steady-energy-no-crash/).

I’m curious — do you rely on caffeine to power through mornings, or have you found a routine that gives you steady energy without the crash?

Just—
Flashes.
Writing appearing in a prayer book.
Messages.
His handwriting.
My handwriting.
Conversations.
""Can you see this?""
""Yes.""
""Who are you?""
""Hina.""
""I'm Ayan.""
I grabbed my head.
""What—what is this?""
""Memories,"" Ayan said.
He was crying.
""We talked. Before. Through—through something. Writing that appeared.""
""Yes,"" I said.
I could feel it.
Almost remember it.
""We talked every day.""
""At 6:42.""
""For weeks.""
More flashes:
""I'm forgetting things.""
""Me too.""
""Should we stop?""
""Can you?""
""We were losing ourselves,"" I said.
""To maintain the connection.""
""But we didn't stop.""
""No.""
AYAN
More memories flooding back:
""What's today's date?""
""October 15, 2024.""
""That's not possible.""
""Why not?""
""Because it's 2026 here.""
""We're two years apart.""
""I found out about the time gap,"" I said.
My voice shaking.
""And then I found out—""
Headline:
""Local Shrine Keeper Dies in Landslide — October 23, 2024""
""Hina Nakamura, 25, killed during evening duties.""
""You died,"" I said.
Looking at her.
Really seeing her.
""You were supposed to die.""
She was crying too.
""But I didn't.""
""Because I saved you.""
""You came here. Across time. To save me.""
""Yes.""
More memories:
Running.
Grabbing her hand.
Pulling her away.
Rocks falling.
The shard shattering.
Light exploding.
Everything being erased.
HINA
I remembered.
All of it.
The messages.
The connection.
Falling in love through written words.
Never seeing his face.
Never hearing his voice.
Until the end.
Until he saved me.
""We loved each other,"" I said.
""Yes.""
""And you gave up your memories of me to save my life.""
""We both did. The timeline corrected itself. Erased us from each other.""
""But we found each other anyway.""
He pulled me close.
""We did.""
""Five years later. Different people. Different circumstances.""
""But the same love.""
I looked up at him.
""I fell in love with you twice.""
""So did I.""
""Once across time.""
""And once across a train station.""
We stood there.
In the blue hour.
Remembering everything.




HINA
The shift began to fade.
The light returning to normal.
Gravity settling.
Sound coming back.
But we held onto each other.
""Are we going to forget again?"" I asked.
""I don't know.""
""I don't want to.""
""Neither do I.""
The blue hour ended.
We stood in normal twilight.
Still holding each other.
Waiting.
Checking.
""Do you remember?"" I asked.
""Everything,"" he said.
""Do you?""
""Yes. It's staying. The memories are staying.""
""Why?""
""I don't know. Maybe because we're together now. In the same time. The same place.""
""Maybe the paradox is resolved.""
""Or maybe—""
I kissed him.
""Maybe love is stronger than time.""
AYAN
We stayed at the shrine until dark.
Talking.
Remembering.
Processing.
""I wrote you every day,"" I said.
""Told you everything.""
""I did too,"" she said.
""Shared pieces of myself I'd never shared with anyone.""
""We fell in love without seeing each other.""
""Just words.""
""Just three minutes a day.""
""It was enough.""
""More than enough.""
We sat on the shrine steps.
Looking at the sky.
""I lost myself to talk to you,"" I said.
""Forgot who I was. Piece by piece.""
""So did I.""
""Was it worth it?""
She took my hand.
""You saved my life. So yes.""
""But we forgot each other.""
""And found each other again.""
""Five years later.""
""Maybe that was always the plan,"" she said.
""Maybe we needed those five years. To become who we needed to be. To be ready for this.""
""For what?""
""For love without condition. Without magic. Just us.""
I kissed her.
""Just us is enough.""
""More than enough.""
HINA
We returned to the city the next day.
Different than when we'd left.
We remembered everything now.
The blue hour.
The messages.
The cost.
The save.
The forgetting.
All of it.
""What do we do now?"" I asked.
We were on the train.
Heading home.
""We live,"" Ayan said.
""Together. Remembering.""
""Will the blue hour come back?""
""I don't know. Do you want it to?""
I thought about it.
""No,"" I said.
""I don't need it anymore. I have you. Here. Real. Present.""
""Same.""
""The blue hour was beautiful.""
""But this is better.""
""Why?""
""Because it's real. Because you're here. Because I can touch you and hold you and see your face.""
""We lost so much time.""
""We did. Five years of not knowing each other.""
""Do you regret it?""
""No. Because we're here now. And we have the rest of our lives.""
I leaned against him.
""The rest of our lives,"" I repeated.
""I like the sound of that.""
AYAN
Six months later.
We were living together.
My apartment.
The one with the west-facing window.
The one where I'd first felt the blue hour.
Every evening at 6:42, we'd stop.
Together.
Watch the sunset.
No shift.
No magic.
Just normal twilight.
But it was ours.
""Do you miss it?"" Hina asked one evening.
""The blue hour?""
""Yeah.""
""Sometimes. Do you?""
""Sometimes. It was special.""
""It was.""
""But this is special too.""
I kissed her forehead.
""More special.""
""Because it's real.""
""Because it's us.""
We stood at the window.
Watching the sky change colors.
Normal colors.
Beautiful colors.
""I love you,"" she said.
""I love you too.""
""I've loved you across time.""
""And I've loved you across forgetting.""
""And now we love each other across breakfast and coffee and normal evenings.""
I laughed.
""The most impossible kind of love.""
""Why?""
""Because it's ordinary. And ordinary is the hardest thing to maintain.""
""Good thing we've already done impossible,"" she said.
""Twice.""
""Twice.""
We watched the sun set.
Together.
Remembering everything.
Grateful for everything.
Present for everything.
HINA
One year later.
October 23, 2030.
Anniversary of the landslide.
Anniversary of being saved.
We went back to the shrine.
Together.
Climbed the steps.
Two hundred and thirty-seven.
Counted together.
At step 180, we stopped.
""Habit,"" Ayan said.
""Good habit,"" I said.
Reached the top.
The shrine was peaceful.
Well-maintained.
Grandmother had retired.
New keeper now.
But they let us visit.
Let us stand in the courtyard.
At 6:42 PM.
We stood together.
Holding hands.
Waiting.
Not for the blue hour.
Just being present.
The sun set.
Normal sunset.
No shift.
No magic.
""It's really gone,"" Ayan said.
""Yeah.""
""How do you feel about that?""
""Grateful,"" I said.
""It gave us each other. Twice. That's more than most people get.""
""True.""
""But I don't need it anymore.""
""Because you have me.""
""Because I have you. Here. Real. Alive.""
HINA
He pulled something from his pocket.
Small box.
""Speaking of having me,"" he said.
I stared at the box.
""Ayan—""
""I saved your life once,"" he said.
""Across time. Across impossible odds. Because I couldn't imagine a world without you in it.""
He opened the box.
Simple ring.
Beautiful ring.
""And I still can't,"" he continued.
""I don't want to live in any timeline where you're not beside me.""
Tears streaming down my face.
""So, Hina Nakamura,"" he said.
""Will you marry me? In this timeline. In this life. Forever.""
I didn't hesitate.
""Yes.""
""Yes?""
""Yes yes yes.""
He slipped the ring on my finger.
I kissed him.
There.
At the shrine.
At 6:42 PM.
Where everything had broken.
Where everything had mended.
Where everything had begun.
Again.
AYAN
We got married in the spring.
Small ceremony.
At the shrine.
Grandmother came.
My coworker came.
Her bookstore friends came.
Small.
Intimate.
Perfect.
At 6:42 PM, we said our vows.
Not because of the blue hour.
Because that was our time.
The time we'd been connected across years.
The time we'd been saved.
The time we'd found each other again.
When the officiant said,
""You may kiss,""
The sun was setting.
Normal colors.
Beautiful colors.
Our colors.
And for just one moment—
One brief, impossible moment—
The light shifted.
Just a breath.
Just a whisper.
Reds to violet.
Blues to gold.
Gravity tilted.
Sound dulled.
The blue hour.
One last time.
Blessing us.
Releasing us.
Saying goodbye.
Then it faded.
Back to normal.
Back to real.
Back to us.
Everyone else had missed it.
Too brief.
Too subtle.
But we'd felt it.
""Did you—"" Hina started.
""Yeah,"" I said.
""I felt it.""
""One last time.""
""To say goodbye.""
""Or thank you.""
""Or both.""
EPILOGUE
HINA
Five years later.
We have a daughter.
Three years old.
Dark hair.
Curious eyes.
She asks questions constantly.
""Why is the sky blue?""
""Where do clouds come from?""
""What happens when we forget things?""
That last one stops me.
""What do you mean?"" I ask.
""If we forget something important,"" she says,
""Does it still matter?""
I look at Ayan.
He smiles.
""Yes,"" I tell her.
""It still matters. Because even if we forget with our minds, we remember with our hearts.""
""How?""
""The heart knows things the mind doesn't. The heart remembers people and moments and love even when the mind forgets the details.""
""Like what?""
""Like how I knew your father was important the moment I met him. Even though I'd never seen him before.""
""But you had seen him before,"" she says matter-of-factly.
I freeze.
""What?""
""You'd seen him before. Just in a different time.""
Ayan and I exchange glances.
""How do you know that?"" he asks.
She shrugs.
""I don't know. I just do.""
She runs off to play.
Leaving us standing there.
AYAN
That night, after our daughter is asleep, Hina and I sit by the window.
The same window where I first felt the shift.
Ten years ago.
A lifetime ago.
""Do you ever wonder what would have happened?"" she asks.
""What do you mean?""
""If you hadn't saved me. If the blue hour had never happened. If we'd never connected.""
""You'd be dead.""
""Yes.""
""Then no. I don't wonder. Because that timeline doesn't exist.""
""But it did exist. For a while. I was dead in your time.""
""And then you weren't.""
""Because you changed it.""
""We changed it. Together.""
FINAL SCENE
HINA — Twenty years later
I'm standing at the shrine.
Alone.
It's October 23rd, 2050.
I'm 51 years old.
Ayan died six months ago.
Cancer.
We had thirty years together.
Thirty beautiful years.
Our daughter is grown now.
Has children of her own.
They wanted to come with me today.
I asked to be alone.
Just once.
Just today.
I climb the steps.
Two hundred and thirty-seven.
I still count.
At step 180, I stop.
Out of habit.
His habit.
Our habit.
I reach the top at 6:30.
Twelve minutes early.
I sit by the offering box.
Where I stood when he saved me.
Where he proposed.
Where we married.
This place holds everything.
I wait.
6:42.
There.
The shift.
After twenty years.
The blue hour.
Gentle.
Soft.
Welcoming.
""Ayan?"" I whisper.
The wind chime rings.
Once.
Clear.
Perfect.
And I feel him.
Not see.
Not hear.
Feel.
""I miss you.""
The shift holds.
Warm.
Like an embrace.
""I love you.""
One final pulse.
Then it fades.
POST-CREDITS SCENE
A girl.
Seventeen.
Standing at a train station.
6:42 PM.
The light shifts.
Writing appears on her palm.
""Hello. Can you see this?""
She smiles.
Writes back.
""Yes. Who are you?""
Fade to black.
Love transcends time.
Always.

What should I say?,"I (30s F) have been no-contact with my dad (60s M) for a little over a year. We've had a rocky relationship forever, and for a while, we were trying to fix it. I had a bad childhood, and he was too distracted by his own unresolved trauma and circumstances related to my mom and siblings to be a present parent to me. I understood that he was genuinely trying to do his best by everybody, so I wanted to try and build a bridge between us, even though I still held a lot of resentment.

About a year ago, he made a choice that didn't surprise me, but that blew up our reconciliation efforts. I realized that if he and I can look at the same thing, and I see inexcusable cruelty and he sees something he wants to stand behind and support, a relationship between us has no legs to stand on. What we each want to prioritize in the world is in fundamental conflict with each other, and his words about caring about my well-being now felt as empty as when I was a kid. So I broke off contact with him.

My cousin is getting married this spring, and my dad and I are both going. I don't want there to be extra pressure on anyone at the event - it should be about the bride and groom, not about my dad and I seeing each other for the first time since no-contact. So, part of me thinks I should reach out to him and meet for coffee or something, and if he has anything to say, he can say it there instead of possibly trying to have or avoid a high-stress conversation at a wedding.

But the thing is, I have nothing more to say, and I don't plan to forgive him. If he doesn't regret what he stood by, nothing changes. If he does regret it, I frankly still wouldn't trust his sincerity or his judgment. And what would I say? ""Meet me for coffee if you have anything to say to me, but don't get your hopes up because I have nothing to say to you, and I don't forgive you, I just don't want to add more stress to Cousin's wedding???""

So...what do you think, Reddit? Should I reach out to him before the wedding? And if I should, what should I say?",1,1770644025.0,Advice,6,1.0,False

WHEN THE SKY FORGOT OUR NAMES
Part IV – Recognition
AYAN
I called her at 2 AM.
Couldn't wait.
She answered on the first ring.
""I can't sleep either,"" she said.
""Hina, I need to ask you something.""
""Okay.""
""The landslide. October 23, 2024. Do you remember what happened?""
Silence.
Then:
""How do you know about that?""
""I searched for you. After we met. Found articles.""
""Why would you search for me?""
""I don't know. But I had notes. From years ago. About you. About that day.""
""What kind of notes?""
I read them to her.
""Save her. October 23. 6:42 PM.""
She was quiet for a long time.
""Ayan. What time did the landslide happen?""
I checked the article.
""6:42 PM.""
""And what time do we both wait every day?""
""6:42.""
""That's not a coincidence.""
""No.""
""Someone saved me that day,"" she said.
""I was moved. Pulled away from where the rocks fell. But I can't remember who.""
My heart was pounding.
""What if it was me?""
""How? You weren't there.""
""What if I was? What if I—""
I stopped.
It sounded insane.
""What if you traveled through time to save me?"" she finished.
""Yes.""
""That's impossible.""
""So is this. So is us. Meeting like this. Feeling like this.""
""I know.""
""Hina. Do you believe in impossible things?""
She laughed softly.
""I'm starting to.""
HINA
We met the next morning.
Same cafe.
Both exhausted.
Neither having slept.
I brought my journal.
He brought his sketchbooks.
We laid everything out on the table.
My entries:
""Waiting for someone.""
""Missing someone.""
""6:42 PM – the time feels important.""
His sketches:
The shrine.
Hundreds of them.
All drawn before he'd ever been there.
""I went there,"" he said.
""October 23, 2026. The train ticket's in my apartment.""
""Two years after I almost died.""
""Yes.""
""Why?""
""I don't know. But I was obsessed. I have notes about atmospheric anomalies. Time distortions. A meteor in October 2024.""
I grabbed my phone.
Searched:
""meteor October 2024""
Found articles.
""Near-miss asteroid passes Earth — October 2024""
""Atmospheric anomalies reported in mountainous regions""
""Locals report time feeling 'wrong' during pass""
""It happened,"" I said.
""The meteor. It was real.""
""And if it caused time distortions—""
""Then maybe time travel is possible.""
We stared at each other.
""This is insane,"" I said.
""Completely insane.""
""But what if it's true?""
""Then we met before,"" he said.
""Somehow. Some way.""
""And forgot.""
""Both forgot.""
""Why would we forget?""
He looked at his sketches.
""What if that was the cost?""
AYAN
We spent the whole day researching.
Found more articles about the meteor.
Found forums of people discussing strange experiences in October 2024.
One post stood out:
""I swear I lived the same week twice. Like time looped. Anyone else?""
Responses:
""YES. October 15–23. Everything felt doubled.""
""I had memories of things that hadn't happened yet.""
""Time felt broken.""
""Look at the dates,"" Hina said.
""October 15 to 23.""
""The week leading up to your landslide.""
""The week when time broke.""
""What if during that week, we could communicate?"" I said.
""Across time?""
""You in 2026, me in 2024?""
""Yes.""
""But why wouldn't we remember?""
I thought about my notes.
""Save her.""
""What if I changed something?"" I said.
""What if you were supposed to die, but I saved you, and changing the timeline erased our memories of each other?""
""Like a paradox correction.""
""Exactly.""
She was quiet.
""So we met. Fell in love. And you saved my life. And the cost was forgetting each other completely.""
""Maybe.""
""That's—"" her voice broke.
""That's horrible.""
""But we found each other again.""
She looked at me.
""Did we? Or is this the first time?""
""I don't know. But it doesn't feel like the first time.""
""No,"" she agreed.
""It feels like coming home.""
HINA
We kept digging.
Looking for proof.
Something concrete.
""What if we tried to recreate it?"" I said.
""Recreate what?""
""The connection. The time distortion.""
""How?""
""Go back to the shrine. Both of us. On the same date.""
""October 23?""
""Yes.""
""That's five weeks away.""
""I know. But if time broke there once, maybe it can happen again.""
""And if it does?""
""Maybe we'll remember.""
He looked uncertain.
""Or maybe nothing will happen.""
""Maybe. But don't you want to know?""
""Yes.""
""Then we wait five weeks.""



AYAN
Those five weeks were the strangest of my life.
We were together constantly.
Every day.
Learning each other.
But also feeling like we already knew each other.
She'd start a sentence.
I'd finish it.
I'd think something.
She'd say it out loud.
We moved in sync.
Laughed at the same moments.
Reached for each other's hands without thinking.
""This doesn't feel new,"" she said one night.
We were in my apartment.
On the couch.
Her head on my shoulder.
""No,"" I agreed.
""It feels like we've done this before.""
""For years.""
""But we just met.""
""I know.""
""Ayan. I'm falling in love with you.""
I kissed her forehead.
""I'm already in love with you.""
""How?""
""I don't know. But I am.""
""Me too.""
We sat in silence.
Then she said:
""What if we get to the shrine and remember everything?""
""Would that be good or bad?""
""I don't know. What if what we remember is terrible?""
""What if it's beautiful?""
""What if we lose this? This version of us?""
I turned to look at her.
""We won't. Because this is us. Whether we remember or not.""
HINA
October 23, 2029.
Five years to the day after the landslide.
We took the train together.
Held hands the whole way.
Neither of us spoke much.
Too nervous.
What were we expecting?
Proof?
Memories?
Answers?
We reached the base of the mountain at 5 PM.
Looked up at the path.
""You ready?"" he asked.
""No. You?""
""No.""
We started climbing.
Two hundred and thirty-seven steps.
I counted.
He counted.
At step 180, we both stopped.
Without discussing it.
Just stopped.
To catch our breath.
""I've done this before,"" I said.
""So have I.""
We kept climbing.
Reached the shrine at 6:15.
Same as before.
The shrine had been rebuilt since the landslide.
New wood.
New stone.
But the wind chime was the same.
I walked to it.
Touched it.
""I know this wind chime,"" I said.
Ayan was standing by the offering box.
""I've drawn this box,"" he said.
""Hundreds of times.""
We looked at each other.
""6:42,"" I said.
""Twenty-seven minutes.""
We waited.
AYAN
6:42 approached.
We stood in the courtyard.
Holding hands.
Waiting.
""What if nothing happens?"" she asked.
""Then we still have each other.""
""Promise?""
""Promise.""
6:41.
6:42.
There.
The shift.
But not like before.
Gentler.
Softer.
The light changed.
Colors shifting.
Reds to violet.
Blues to gold.
Gravity tilted.
Just slightly.
Sound dulled.
Like underwater.
Hina gasped.
""I know this,"" she said.
""I know this feeling.""
""So do I.""
We stood there.
In the shift.
In the blue hour.
Together.
And then—
HINA
Images.
Not memories.
Not yet.
Just—
Flashes.
Writing appearing in a prayer book.
Messages.
His handwriting.
My handwriting.
Conversations.
""Can you see this?""
""Yes.""
""Who are you?""
""Hina.""
""I'm Ayan.""
I grabbed my head.
""What—what is this?""
""Memories,"" Ayan said.
He was crying.
""We talked. Before. Through—through something. Writing that appeared.""
""Yes,"" I said.
I could feel it.
Almost remember it.
""We talked every day.""
""At 6:42.""
""For weeks.""
More flashes:
""I'm forgetting things.""
""Me too.""
""Should we stop?""
""Can you?""
""We were losing ourselves,"" I said.
""To maintain the connection.""
""But we didn't stop.""
""No.""
AYAN
More memories flooding back:
""What's today's date?""
""October 15, 2024.""
""That's not possible.""
""Why not?""
""Because it's 2026 here.""
""We're two years apart.""
""I found out about the time gap,"" I said.
My voice shaking.
""And then I found out—""
Headline:
""Local Shrine Keeper Dies in Landslide — October 23, 2024""
""Hina Nakamura, 25, killed during evening duties.""
""You died,"" I said.
Looking at her.
Really seeing her.
""You were supposed to die.""
She was crying too.
""But I didn't.""
""Because I saved you.""
""You came here. Across time. To save me.""
""Yes.""
More memories:
Running.
Grabbing her hand.
Pulling her away.
Rocks falling.
The shard shattering.
Light exploding.
Everything being erased.
HINA
I remembered.
All of it.
The messages.
The connection.
Falling in love through written words.
Never seeing his face.
Never hearing his voice.
Until the end.
Until he saved me.
""We loved each other,"" I said.
""Yes.""
""And you gave up your memories of me to save my life.""
""We both did. The timeline corrected itself. Erased us from each other.""
""But we found each other anyway.""
He pulled me close.
""We did.""
""Five years later. Different people. Different circumstances.""
""But the same love.""
I looked up at him.
""I fell in love with you twice.""
""So did I.""
""Once across time.""
""And once across a train station.""
We stood there.
In the blue hour.
Remembering everything.




HINA
The shift began to fade.
The light returning to normal.
Gravity settling.
Sound coming back.
But we held onto each other.
""Are we going to forget again?"" I asked.
""I don't know.""
""I don't want to.""
""Neither do I.""
The blue hour ended.
We stood in normal twilight.
Still holding each other.
Waiting.
Checking.
""Do you remember?"" I asked.
""Everything,"" he said.
""Do you?""
""Yes. It's staying. The memories are staying.""
""Why?""
""I don't know. Maybe because we're together now. In the same time. The same place.""
""Maybe the paradox is resolved.""
""Or maybe—""
I kissed him.
""Maybe love is stronger than time.""
AYAN
We stayed at the shrine until dark.
Talking.
Remembering.
Processing.
""I wrote you every day,"" I said.
""Told you everything.""
""I did too,"" she said.
""Shared pieces of myself I'd never shared with anyone.""
""We fell in love without seeing each other.""
""Just words.""
""Just three minutes a day.""
""It was enough.""
""More than enough.""
We sat on the shrine steps.
Looking at the sky.
""I lost myself to talk to you,"" I said.
""Forgot who I was. Piece by piece.""
""So did I.""
""Was it worth it?""
She took my hand.
""You saved my life. So yes.""
""But we forgot each other.""
""And found each other again.""
""Five years later.""
""Maybe that was always the plan,"" she said.
""Maybe we needed those five years. To become who we needed to be. To be ready for this.""
""For what?""
""For love without condition. Without magic. Just us.""
I kissed her.
""Just us is enough.""
""More than enough.""
HINA
We returned to the city the next day.
Different than when we'd left.
We remembered everything now.
The blue hour.
The messages.
The cost.
The save.
The forgetting.
All of it.
""What do we do now?"" I asked.
We were on the train.
Heading home.
""We live,"" Ayan said.
""Together. Remembering.""
""Will the blue hour come back?""
""I don't know. Do you want it to?""
I thought about it.
""No,"" I said.
""I don't need it anymore. I have you. Here. Real. Present.""
""Same.""
""The blue hour was beautiful.""
""But this is better.""
""Why?""
""Because it's real. Because you're here. Because I can touch you and hold you and see your face.""
""We lost so much time.""
""We did. Five years of not knowing each other.""
""Do you regret it?""
""No. Because we're here now. And we have the rest of our lives.""
I leaned against him.
""The rest of our lives,"" I repeated.
""I like the sound of that.""
AYAN
Six months later.
We were living together.
My apartment.
The one with the west-facing window.
The one where I'd first felt the blue hour.
Every evening at 6:42, we'd stop.
Together.
Watch the sunset.
No shift.
No magic.
Just normal twilight.
But it was ours.
""Do you miss it?"" Hina asked one evening.
""The blue hour?""
""Yeah.""
""Sometimes. Do you?""
""Sometimes. It was special.""
""It was.""
""But this is special too.""
I kissed her forehead.
""More special.""
""Because it's real.""
""Because it's us.""
We stood at the window.
Watching the sky change colors.
Normal colors.
Beautiful colors.
""I love you,"" she said.
""I love you too.""
""I've loved you across time.""
""And I've loved you across forgetting.""
""And now we love each other across breakfast and coffee and normal evenings.""
I laughed.
""The most impossible kind of love.""
""Why?""
""Because it's ordinary. And ordinary is the hardest thing to maintain.""
""Good thing we've already done impossible,"" she said.
""Twice.""
""Twice.""
We watched the sun set.
Together.
Remembering everything.
Grateful for everything.
Present for everything.
HINA
One year later.
October 23, 2030.
Anniversary of the landslide.
Anniversary of being saved.
We went back to the shrine.
Together.
Climbed the steps.
Two hundred and thirty-seven.
Counted together.
At step 180, we stopped.
""Habit,"" Ayan said.
""Good habit,"" I said.
Reached the top.
The shrine was peaceful.
Well-maintained.
Grandmother had retired.
New keeper now.
But they let us visit.
Let us stand in the courtyard.
At 6:42 PM.
We stood together.
Holding hands.
Waiting.
Not for the blue hour.
Just being present.
The sun set.
Normal sunset.
No shift.
No magic.
""It's really gone,"" Ayan said.
""Yeah.""
""How do you feel about that?""
""Grateful,"" I said.
""It gave us each other. Twice. That's more than most people get.""
""True.""
""But I don't need it anymore.""
""Because you have me.""
""Because I have you. Here. Real. Alive.""
HINA
He pulled something from his pocket.
Small box.
""Speaking of having me,"" he said.
I stared at the box.
""Ayan—""
""I saved your life once,"" he said.
""Across time. Across impossible odds. Because I couldn't imagine a world without you in it.""
He opened the box.
Simple ring.
Beautiful ring.
""And I still can't,"" he continued.
""I don't want to live in any timeline where you're not beside me.""
Tears streaming down my face.
""So, Hina Nakamura,"" he said.
""Will you marry me? In this timeline. In this life. Forever.""
I didn't hesitate.
""Yes.""
""Yes?""
""Yes yes yes.""
He slipped the ring on my finger.
I kissed him.
There.
At the shrine.
At 6:42 PM.
Where everything had broken.
Where everything had mended.
Where everything had begun.
Again.
AYAN
We got married in the spring.
Small ceremony.
At the shrine.
Grandmother came.
My coworker came.
Her bookstore friends came.
Small.
Intimate.
Perfect.
At 6:42 PM, we said our vows.
Not because of the blue hour.
Because that was our time.
The time we'd been connected across years.
The time we'd been saved.
The time we'd found each other again.
When the officiant said,
""You may kiss,""
The sun was setting.
Normal colors.
Beautiful colors.
Our colors.
And for just one moment—
One brief, impossible moment—
The light shifted.
Just a breath.
Just a whisper.
Reds to violet.
Blues to gold.
Gravity tilted.
Sound dulled.
The blue hour.
One last time.
Blessing us.
Releasing us.
Saying goodbye.
Then it faded.
Back to normal.
Back to real.
Back to us.
Everyone else had missed it.
Too brief.
Too subtle.
But we'd felt it.
""Did you—"" Hina started.
""Yeah,"" I said.
""I felt it.""
""One last time.""
""To say goodbye.""
""Or thank you.""
""Or both.""
EPILOGUE
HINA
Five years later.
We have a daughter.
Three years old.
Dark hair.
Curious eyes.
She asks questions constantly.
""Why is the sky blue?""
""Where do clouds come from?""
""What happens when we forget things?""
That last one stops me.
""What do you mean?"" I ask.
""If we forget something important,"" she says,
""Does it still matter?""
I look at Ayan.
He smiles.
""Yes,"" I tell her.
""It still matters. Because even if we forget with our minds, we remember with our hearts.""
""How?""
""The heart knows things the mind doesn't. The heart remembers people and moments and love even when the mind forgets the details.""
""Like what?""
""Like how I knew your father was important the moment I met him. Even though I'd never seen him before.""
""But you had seen him before,"" she says matter-of-factly.
I freeze.
""What?""
""You'd seen him before. Just in a different time.""
Ayan and I exchange glances.
""How do you know that?"" he asks.
She shrugs.
""I don't know. I just do.""
She runs off to play.
Leaving us standing there.
AYAN
That night, after our daughter is asleep, Hina and I sit by the window.
The same window where I first felt the shift.
Ten years ago.
A lifetime ago.
""Do you ever wonder what would have happened?"" she asks.
""What do you mean?""
""If you hadn't saved me. If the blue hour had never happened. If we'd never connected.""
""You'd be dead.""
""Yes.""
""Then no. I don't wonder. Because that timeline doesn't exist.""
""But it did exist. For a while. I was dead in your time.""
""And then you weren't.""
""Because you changed it.""
""We changed it. Together.""
FINAL SCENE
HINA — Twenty years later
I'm standing at the shrine.
Alone.
It's October 23rd, 2050.
I'm 51 years old.
Ayan died six months ago.
Cancer.
We had thirty years together.
Thirty beautiful years.
Our daughter is grown now.
Has children of her own.
They wanted to come with me today.
I asked to be alone.
Just once.
Just today.
I climb the steps.
Two hundred and thirty-seven.
I still count.
At step 180, I stop.
Out of habit.
His habit.
Our habit.
I reach the top at 6:30.
Twelve minutes early.
I sit by the offering box.
Where I stood when he saved me.
Where he proposed.
Where we married.
This place holds everything.
I wait.
6:42.
There.
The shift.
After twenty years.
The blue hour.
Gentle.
Soft.
Welcoming.
""Ayan?"" I whisper.
The wind chime rings.
Once.
Clear.
Perfect.
And I feel him.
Not see.
Not hear.
Feel.
""I miss you.""
The shift holds.
Warm.
Like an embrace.
""I love you.""
One final pulse.
Then it fades.
POST-CREDITS SCENE
A girl.
Seventeen.
Standing at a train station.
6:42 PM.
The light shifts.
Writing appears on her palm.
""Hello. Can you see this?""
She smiles.
Writes back.
""Yes. Who are you?""
Fade to black.
Love transcends time.
Always.
THE END

Thanks alot if you have read it till here I have put alot of effort in writing these 4 parts so please support me and my another story will be coming out dark fantasy, action, and mature . Please support it too......thanks alot for all the support.....",0,1770643925.0,stories,3,0.5,False
1r04a2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1r04a2z/please_critique_my_espresso_machine_grinder/,Please critique my espresso machine + grinder choice before I buy [$6000],"Hi all, I have a weird situation and could use some help. I have a u-shaped coffee nook and I don’t have room for a grinder to be on an outlet. Ideally the controls of my future machine would be on the front as well as accessible water filling from the front. I’m looking for a long lasting machine that I can wire into my kitchen in a few years when I am able to buy a house. The u shape is about 17” tall and 24” wide but I have a 12” wide ice maker there already. Plenty of depth maybe 20/24”.

I am good with maintenance and at ok home repairs. I have a lelit bianca v3 and sette 270wi I have been using at work and at my last job we had a rocket I think r nine, can’t quite remember with the same grinder.

My wife and I are morning and afternoon coffee people, so a quick warmup would be nice. I like to do things pretty quickly so a fast warm up time and dual boiler would be great. I am an espresso / cortado / cappuccino / flat white person while she is more latte / americano. Would love to crank out double shots in the evenings for espresso, espresso martinis, and I do like the occasional pour over or cold brew. Right now we have a super automatic lattego, an aeropress, and a moka pot. Single dosing grinder would be ideal so my wife can switch to decaf in the evenings.

My budget is not really that tight I have about $5500 in my moving stipend from work so it would be nice to be around there in terms of price but okay to go over.

I have been pretty sure I want to buy a Línea Micra and a femobrook a5 but I feel like maybe I am spending too much on a coffee machine and not enough on a grinder. I am not sure if there are any better battery powered grinders out there for my situation but would appreciate any advice. If you think there are any espresso machine alternatives I should consider I would love to hear your thoughts.

Again key constraints are 12” wide about, controls in front, water fill in front, dual boiler / fast heat up. And yeah I would prefer something more mechanical to something more electronic based as we already have the super automatic. 

Thanks so much",0,1770643901.0,espresso,13,0.33,False
1r04a2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/antisocialsocialclub/comments/1r04a2l/the_scream_of_a_soul_in_the_darkness_of_the_world/,The scream of a soul in the darkness of the world.,"Hello, group!



I truly hope there's a real sense of community here. Because I've completely lost faith and hope that such a thing exists anywhere...



I most sincerely ask the moderation not to reject my post. Give me a chance to express the storm that has engulfed my heart and soul. Thank you!



I feel like John Coffey. Struck by the pain of reality. Overwhelmed by people, by their bad behavior towards each other, by the cruel scenarios they drag everything living into. By the torture of souls and bodies.



Do you know what it's like? I don't just see it. I feel it. I cry. I'm torn apart from within. And there's no one to hear me. There's no one even to talk to, because people are indoctrinated to talk only about mundane things — work, career, entertainment, possessions...



The world I'm forced to exist in, not by choice but by compulsion, is so brutal and burns me so much that it's hard for me to even put this feeling into words, but despite everything, I will try.



Every day is violence. Every hour, moment, second — pain. I ask myself several times a day how it's possible for an entire humanity to function in such an inhumane and primitive way. How?!



I am a man from Bulgaria, almost 37 years old. The fourth decade is approaching since I've been here, on this condemned planet. In this span of time, I've seen so much bitterness, so much sorrow, so much fear... and I still see and endure all of this... in abundance.



I haven't seen a bright day in this messed-up life, which is anything but life.

I am subjected to economic, social, and all kinds of exclusion. Invisible to women, to my state, to everything that exists.



The rare occasions when someone pretends to notice me and establishes some contact with me, not long after, open demonic behavior begins — behavior of superiority, domination, and authoritarianism. Behavior that deeply hurts me, and when I try to explain this — I receive aggression against myself.



From everywhere, I hear that 'it's my fault' and that 'no one owes me anything,' that my human essence has no value in itself, and the only thing that would make me visible to someone is if I am well-positioned in this world. With a profession. With money. With charisma and charm (imposed standards). Otherwise, I am written off and declared insolvent.



Many men around the world experience this. Mostly young. But already desperate. Because no one sees them, no one sees their pains and struggles, nor shows even elementary interest in their needs. The violence is pervasive, deadly, global.



It's no different with women. But there, the specifics are different. For them, unification consists of being turned into trophies to be conquered, and cosmetic and plastic surgery, media, and social networks constantly bombard them with propaganda about how they should look to be 'marketable' in the relationship market.



That's why they become increasingly artificial, but also increasingly arrogant. Because the matrix of materialism and consumerism has made them think they have a vast sea of choices of all kinds of men at any given moment, while at the same time, a not-insignificant percentage of normal and sensitive men (there are already statistics on male loneliness and isolation) literally perish in oblivion and even commit suicide — some do it slowly through depression, addictions, and other ways, while others quickly and directly.



What kind of world is this that constantly reproduces all this darkness of horrors, violence, and exploitation? What else is it but psychotic and cursed?

Governments feed on pain. On human alienation. On divisions and moral collapse in states and among nations.



Institutions, the press, and authorities are in the hands of total psychopaths with openly maniacal and sick ambitions, as the legendary John Lennon says. They create technologies for climate change, gender change (even in children), abortions, green deals, mass surveillance, digital currencies, and all sorts of other absurdities, aiming to disrupt the natural order and appearance of human beings (and communities)...



But no one deals with world hunger, as a result of which millions of people die every year. In some areas of our planet, children look like skeletons, have no access to clean drinking water, and are grateful even for a cup of rice a day. While in other regions (USA, for example), burger-eating contests are held. Food is wasted... What is this, if not madness?



The world spends TRILLIONS on military purposes and armaments. But says it has no resources to feed the hungry and provide for all living organisms?! Do you understand what a horror of horrors this is?!



Not to mention intentional and mass migration, the transformation of white countries into ghettos, the humiliation that indigenous European peoples and cultures endure and are subjected to. For religious extremism and wars... In the name of religion, profit, conquest.



All of this burns me when I see it, feel it, and realize it. No, I don't just state facts... I feel it as wounds on my own body. This is killing me. Systematically. Methodically. Every day... And every night.



As long as I can remember, I've lived on the edge of survival. In a world that talks about abundance and space travel, I am deprived of even the most basic human needs — food, hot water, peace. Even on cold winter days, I have to roam the streets and collect some scraps to survive another messed-up day.



I also collect cigarette butts from street bins and bus stops. So I have something to smoke, because my nerves can't take it otherwise. Every day is a struggle for survival. And I don't know what life in the true sense of the word is.



I lie down and wake up feeling tired, with body aches, my teeth are crumbling, my heart tightens, my head spins. I've experienced panic attacks, phobia of people, fear of persecution, nightmares, intrusive thoughts, and depression since I was 9-10 years old. That's more than 20 years in this horror. Without the possibility of treatment, deliverance, or an exit.



I have repeatedly been at the mercy of the streets... I know what cold, hunger, rain, fear, and a sense of doom are. I've also been to hospitals (psychiatric), where I witnessed another dose of violence, and where I clearly saw that people are not cured. They just get sicker there. No one cares about them. Even less the staff... Everything is upside down.



Currently, I inhabit a small and miserable attic room in a seaside town in Bulgaria. I am grateful to have a roof over my head, but it's as much a roof as it is my personal cell. Because I have no peace from the noise and reckless behavior of the roommates from the other rooms.



Because I don't even have basic conditions to maintain my needs and hygiene normally. And because no one cares what happens to me and how I'm falling apart.

This city is too dangerous, and the streets abound with hooligans who shout, behave aggressively, and create tension. And every time I have to go out, it's a real nightmare for me. When I return to my room, I cross myself before the icon, with gratitude that I survived today. But I don't know how long I can...



I pay for this apartment with partial assistance, and when I pay my rent + electricity and water, almost nothing is left for me, and again I have to survive with whatever I find on the streets, if I find anything at all. From this, my body weakens more and more. It shows me in every way that it cannot and does not want to be tortured in such a way anymore, and I am forced to torment it... and I cannot give it the rest and peace it desperately needs.



Will you tell me to seek help? Do you think I haven't tried? Since the distant years of 2010-2011, I've been alarming about my situation. I write in newspapers, groups, websites. I've been to public organizations. Do you know what happens? No response from anywhere. And the rare cases when there was some... it was very temporary and short-lived. And then I'm told the familiar 'I need to pull myself together' and go work something, otherwise, life is impossible.



No one asks how, with these pains, with this panic, with this anxiety and sense of horror when among people, I could cope? How? No one knows what's happening in my body and psyche. And that as soon as I have an attack, terrible nausea and vomiting begin — sometimes of stomach acid.



As soon as women find out about my situation, they just disappear. There isn't even a girl I can go out with for a walk, or have a coffee. I'm not a person to them. Because they don't see a 'man' in me according to the imposed criteria, but they see a burden they don't want to bother with. They demand the impossible, but don't even give the most basic support, loyalty, and love...



So many lost years already. From my youth. Over 20 years of fruitless searching for the most natural things here — love, support, selflessness, meaning, loyalty. They are gone. The most natural is the hardest to find.



And everything is tied to money. Even the right to love and be loved, the right to create relationships — the virus of money has penetrated there too. People look at each other as market products in catalogs, not as souls, as the great Creator made us.



How can I exist here? Please tell me!

Where is my place? Where are my kindred spirits?

Where is mercy?



I feel that if all this continues... and if I don't find a way and a chance very soon to leave here and start somewhere fresh, anew... I will destroy myself.

I want to find peace and a place that is not a cell, but a home. I want to heal, to create and build. To love and be loved!

I DO NOT want to just exist, to work, to be a cog in the matrix wheel.



My soul is here with a completely different meaning and purpose.



No human being here, nor animal, should live in conditions of deprivation, fear, and humiliation. Not one. Never. Under any circumstances. This is a fundamental principle for me. Because life is before any economy! Before any damned human stereotypical cliché.



And right now, I again have to think about how to get what no living creature should lack — food.



Not to mention that over the years I saw with my own eyes how homeless people are left to die on city benches. While 'law enforcement officers' mock them and consider them a burden.



That's all from me. For now.



While one percent of the super-rich (a parasitic layer) live in glass capsules and bathe with gold dust shampoos, own private islands and planes... at the same time, millions of other creatures perish in loneliness, deprivation, and misery. Because the same authorities only think of themselves and their personal selfishness.



Quote to end:



'Doctors, lawyers, judges — they all make money. But writers — they starve, they suffer, they commit suicide!'

1r046oq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menscomeback/comments/1r046oq/how_to_be_disgustingly_attractive_the_psychology/,# How to Be Disgustingly Attractive: The Psychology That Actually Works,"Looked around at a party last month and realized something kinda depressing. Most guys (myself included for way too long) are playing the attraction game on hard mode without even knowing it. We're told to ""just be confident bro"" or hit the gym harder, but nobody talks about the actual psychology behind what makes someone magnetic.

Spent the last year diving deep into this, books, research papers, podcasts with actual psychologists and dating experts. Not pickup artist BS. Real behavioral science. Turns out attraction isn't really about looks or money or height like we've been sold. It's about understanding human psychology and actually developing yourself as a person. Wild concept right?

Here's what I found that actually moves the needle:

**stop optimizing for approval, start optimizing for genuine interest**

Most guys are constantly scanning for validation. You can feel it in conversations, that desperate energy of ""do they like me yet?""

Read ""[Models](https://a.co/d/06AwccEI)"" by Mark Manson (yeah the subtle art guy before he blew up). This book legitimately changed how I see attraction. Manson breaks down why neediness kills attraction faster than anything else, and how vulnerability (real vulnerability, not trauma dumping) creates genuine connection. He's got this whole framework about polarization, basically stop trying to appeal to everyone and instead be authentically yourself so you attract people who actually vibe with you. Insanely good read if you're tired of playing games.

The key insight: attraction happens when someone feels they're seeing the real you, not a performance. People can smell inauthenticity from a mile away.

**develop actual depth and interests**

This sounds obvious but most people don't do it. You need to be genuinely interesting to be attractive.

For anyone wanting to go deeper without the energy drain of heavy reading, there's this AI learning app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that's been useful. It's built by former Google engineers and pulls from thousands of psychology books, dating research, and expert interviews to create personalized audio content. You can literally tell it something like ""I want to become more magnetic as an introvert"" and it generates a structured learning plan with episodes you can adjust from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive (the smoky one hits different), and you can pause mid-episode to ask questions to this virtual coach thing called Freedia. Way more efficient than trying to piece together insights from multiple books yourself.

**understand the psychology of desire**

""The Art of Seduction"" by Robert Greene gets a bad rap but it's actually a masterclass in human psychology. Not manipulation, understanding. Greene breaks down the 9 seducer archetypes throughout history (Casanova, Cleopatra, etc) and shows how they created desire through mystery, presence, and understanding what people actually want versus what they say they want.

Warning: this book will make you question everything you think you know about attraction. It's dense, it's historical, but Greene is a researcher who spent years studying power dynamics. The audiobook is like 26 hours but worth every minute if you want to actually understand human nature.

**fix your energy before anything else**

Nobody talks about this enough. You can have perfect style and witty lines but if your energy is off, you're cooked.

""[Atomic Habits](https://a.co/d/05ygR2j7)"" by James Clear isn't a dating book but it should be required reading. Clear breaks down how to actually build habits that stick (backed by neuroscience research). The stuff about identity based habits is crucial, you can't fake being attractive, you have to actually become the kind of person who naturally attracts others.

Implement his habit stacking method: after I brush my teeth (existing habit), I do 2 minutes of meditation (new habit). After I pour my morning coffee, I read 10 pages of something substantial. Small changes compound into becoming genuinely more centered and present.

**stop consuming, start creating**

Attractive people create value in the world somehow. Doesn't matter if it's art, helping others, building something, whatever.

The podcast ""The Knowledge Project"" with Shane Parrish has episodes on mental models and decision making that level up how you think. Episode with Naval Ravikant about specific knowledge is gold. You become more attractive when you develop unique skills and perspectives that only you have.

**actually work on your emotional intelligence**

Downloaded Finch (habit building app with a cute bird) to track daily mood and reflection. Sounds dumb but forcing yourself to check in emotionally every day builds self awareness. You can't connect deeply with others if you're disconnected from yourself.

Studied research from Dr. John Gottman (the relationship scientist who can predict divorce with 90% accuracy). His work shows that emotional attunement, the ability to recognize and respond to others' emotional states, is the biggest predictor of relationship success. This isn't some soft skill, it's learnable and it's probably the most attractive quality you can develop.

**fix the basics (but not obsessively)**

Yeah you need to handle hygiene, dress reasonably well, stay in decent shape. But here's the thing, these are baseline requirements, not the main event. Once you clear the threshold of ""not actively repelling people"" through basic self care, the returns diminish fast.

The biggest shift for me was realizing attraction isn't about reaching some perfect form. It's about becoming genuinely comfortable in your own skin and developing real depth as a person.

The guys who seem effortlessly attractive? They're not thinking about attraction at all. They're focused on their mission, their growth, their genuine interests. The magnetism is a byproduct.

Also quick note: if you're struggling with mental health stuff, the app Bloom has solid CBT exercises and the therapist matching actually works (way better than betterhelp imo). Can't be attractive if you're drowning internally. Handle your mental health first.

**the actual formula (if there is one)**

Work on yourself because you genuinely want to be better, not to impress anyone. Develop real skills and knowledge. Understand human psychology and emotional dynamics. Be present and authentic in interactions. Create value somehow. Stay curious about people and the world.

Attraction follows naturally when you become someone who's genuinely engaged with life and growth. Sounds cheesy but after researching this extensively, it's just true.

The system and biology stack things against us in weird ways (attention economy making everyone distracted, dating apps gamifying human connection, cultural messages about what makes men valuable). But these are navigable obstacles, not destiny. The tools exist to develop real magnetism, just gotta use them.

Stop trying to be attractive. Start trying to be genuinely excellent.",1,1770643651.0,Menscomeback,0,1.0,False

Why do I feel like Allah hates me?  
If anyone has ever been through this, please… tell me that I’m not alone. Tell me that this isn’t the end. I need hope, I beg you, tell me that you have lived a similar life, and everything changed for you?

I feel like I have completely failed at life.

I am still in higher education after several repeated years and a chaotic academic path. I am not married, I don’t have children, and I still live with my parents and my siblings. When I look at my life honestly, it feels empty, messy, and without direction.

I barely have any female friends left. Most of them are married, working, living their lives. I’ve become “the nice friend”: the one people talk to when they’re bored, the one they meet for coffee once a year, the one who listens. But not the one they truly include, not the one they build things with. I’ve been abandoned so many times that it has broken me.

I study remotely for medical reasons, so I barely see anyone. I’m always at home. I wear the hijab, and in my country, finding a job while wearing it is extremely difficult. As a result, I’m in deep loneliness. A loneliness that doesn’t elevate me or make me better, but slowly destroys me.

I’ve gained a lot of weight over the past few years. I find myself ugly. I don’t love myself anymore. I don’t attract anyone, and the few people I do attract are absolutely not what I want, mentally or emotionally. It deeply damages my self-esteem.

My parents barely go out. They sleep all day, there is no family life, no movement. We don’t do anything together. I don’t travel. I almost never go out. I feel trapped, physically and mentally.

And in the middle of all this, there is Allah. I ask myself every day: why? Why put me in this situation? Why make me feel such deep loneliness? I sincerely feel punished, hated, trapped in a life that makes no sense. I don’t understand what Allah expects from me. I try to be patient, but I am exhausted.

I had dreams. Many dreams. But they all flew away, they were all destroyed. And my parents raised me in fear: fear of everything, fear of living, fear of daring. I was always told to stay quiet, that my husband would work, that I didn’t need to dream too big. Today, I’m afraid to live. Afraid to make choices. And I feel like all the roads were blocked before I even had the chance to try.

I want to take control of my life again. Truly. Take back my life, my body, my future. But I can’t. I feel paralyzed, as if I’m condemned to this existence: without a job, without marriage, without children, without outings, without projects.

I’m at my limit. I’m afraid that my life will look like this forever. I don’t understand. I truly don’t understand.

Why do I feel like Allah hates me? I don’t want to tell my whole life story here, but I am exhausted. Truly. I have gone through so many difficult trials (the death of loved ones, sexual assaults, harassment, humiliation, illness, only horrible things that didn’t make me stronger at all, but instead left me completely drained). I ask myself every day: what did I do to Allah for Him to hurt me so much? Why so many trials, so many blockages, so much loneliness? I feel destroyed from the inside.

Honestly, I don’t even feel like praying anymore. Not out of arrogance, but out of confusion. I don’t understand the meaning of what Allah is making me live through. I don’t see the wisdom, I don’t see an exit, I only see pain piling up year after year. Will He help me one day? Will He open doors for me? Or am I condemned to this life, to this confinement, to this loneliness?

Ramadan is coming, and I will make du’a. Again. A lot. Like always. I will ask Him to change my life, to take me out of this situation, to finally give me some relief. But deep down, I ask myself a question that scares me: do I still have hope? I don’t even know anymore.

I am tired of being strong. Tired of waiting. Tired of not understanding.  
I should be living like people my age, but instead I feel like I’m just waiting for death.

The weird part? We all know what we should do, drink more water, exercise, stop doom scrolling, but we just don't do it. After reading dozens of books and listening to hundreds of hours of expert content, I realized the gap between who you are and who you want to be isn't about willpower or motivation. It's about understanding how your brain actually works and using that knowledge to rewire yourself. This isn't recycled advice. This is the real shit.

# Step 1: Stop Building Your Identity Around Your Past Self

Here's what most people get wrong, they think their identity is fixed. You tell yourself ""I'm just not a morning person"" or ""I'm not good with people"" and boom, you've locked yourself into a version of you that doesn't serve your future. Dr. Benjamin Hardy talks about this in Personality Isn't Permanent. He's an organizational psychologist who basically flipped traditional personality science on its head. The book destroys the myth that you're stuck with the personality you have. Your brain is ridiculously adaptable, way more than you think.

The trick? Start acting like the person you want to become, even when it feels fake at first. Your brain doesn't know the difference between ""real"" you and ""performing"" you. Neural pathways form based on repeated behavior, not feelings. If you want to be confident, act confident even when you're terrified. Your brain will catch up. Hardy backs this with actual neuroscience, showing how our brains physically restructure based on new experiences and behaviors.

This book will make you question everything you think you know about who you are. Insanely good read if you're tired of feeling trapped by your own story.

# Step 2: Build Systems, Not Goals

Goals are sexy but systems are what actually change you. James Clear breaks this down perfectly in Atomic Habits, which won Book of the Year and sold like 15 million copies for a reason. Clear is a behavior change expert and his whole thing is about tiny improvements that compound over time.

Here's the difference, a goal is ""I want to lose 20 pounds."" A system is ""I'm the type of person who moves their body every day."" Goals have endpoints. Systems are continuous. When you focus on systems, you're building an identity, not chasing a finish line.

Start with what Clear calls ""habit stacking."" Attach new habits to existing ones. Already brush your teeth? Do 10 pushups right after. Already make coffee? Read one page of a book while it brews. These micro habits feel stupid and insignificant but they're literally reshaping who you are at a neurological level.

Also, use an app like Finch to gamify your habit building. It's this cute little app where you take care of a virtual bird by completing real life self care tasks. Sounds childish but the dopamine hit from seeing your bird grow keeps you consistent when motivation dies.

For those who want structured guidance on building these systems, there's BeFreed, a personalized learning app built by Columbia University alumni and AI experts from Google. You can type in specific goals like ""build better daily habits"" or ""become more disciplined,"" and it pulls from psychology research, expert interviews, and books like the ones mentioned here to create a custom learning plan just for you.

What's cool is you can adjust how deep you want to go, from a quick 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with real examples and context. Plus, you get to pick the voice and tone, I went with a smoky, sarcastic narrator that makes even boring habit science feel entertaining. It's basically turned my commute into productive learning time instead of mindless scrolling.

# Step 3: Understand Your Brain Is Working Against You (And How to Fight Back)

Your brain is designed to keep you safe, not help you grow. Dr. Andrew Huberman explains this on his podcast Huberman Lab, he's a Stanford neuroscientist who makes brain science actually understandable. His episodes on dopamine and motivation completely changed how I approach behavior change.

Here's the deal, your brain releases dopamine when you anticipate a reward, not when you get it. That's why scrolling feels good even though it leaves you empty. You're getting tiny dopamine hits from anticipation. But here's the kicker, if you constantly spike your dopamine with easy wins like social media, junk food, porn, whatever, your baseline dopamine drops. Then real meaningful work feels impossible because your brain is like ""where's my hit?""

Huberman recommends ""dopamine fasting"" but not the cringe version where you sit in silence for 48 hours. Just reduce high dopamine activities for a bit. Delete Instagram for a week. Stop watching porn. Your baseline resets and suddenly working on your goals doesn't feel like torture anymore.

# Step 4: Kill Your Victim Mindset (Seriously, It's Poisoning You)

This one's gonna sting. You're probably holding onto stories about why you can't become who you want to be. Maybe it's your childhood, your lack of money, your shitty job, whatever. And look, those things are real. But the second you make them your identity, you're done. You've given yourself permission to stay stuck.

Dr. Edith Eger survived Auschwitz and became a therapist who helps people escape mental prisons. Her book The Choice is devastating and powerful. She talks about how we choose our responses to everything, even the most horrific circumstances. She's not saying ""just think positive,"" she's saying you have more agency than you believe.

You don't have to forgive everything or pretend trauma didn't happen. But you do have to stop letting it define your future. The person you want to become doesn't live in victimhood. They live in agency.

# Step 5: Surround Yourself With People Who Reflect Your Future Self

You become the average of the five people you spend the most time with. Cliche but true. If your friends are negative, unmotivated, or stuck, you will be too. Not because you're weak but because humans are social creatures who unconsciously mirror the people around them.

This doesn't mean dump all your friends. But it does mean you need to actively seek out people who are living the life you want. Join communities, online or IRL, where people are doing the things you want to do. Use apps like Ash, which connects you with relationship and mental health coaching that actually challenges you to grow instead of just validating your feelings.

Your environment shapes you more than your willpower ever will. Change your environment, change yourself.

# Step 6: Get Comfortable With Sucking at Stuff

The person you want to become is good at things you currently suck at. You're going to have to go through an awkward phase where you're bad and everyone can see it. Most people quit here because being bad feels like proof they were never meant to do it anyway.

Carol Dweck's research on growth mindset shows that people who believe skills are learnable outperform people with ""natural talent"" who think ability is fixed. When you suck at something, your brain is literally building new neural connections. Sucking is the process, not a sign you should quit.

Reframe failure. Every time you fail, you're collecting data. You're learning what doesn't work. That's not wasted time, that's the actual path forward.

# Step 7: Stop Waiting for Motivation and Just Start Moving

Motivation is a feeling that comes and goes. The person you want to become doesn't wait for it. They act regardless. Mel Robbins talks about this in her stuff about the 5 Second Rule. You have five seconds between having an idea and your brain talking you out of it. Count down, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and move.

Your brain will resist. It wants comfort. But action creates momentum and momentum creates motivation. Not the other way around. You don't feel like going to the gym, then go. You go to the gym, then feel motivated to keep going.

Start before you're ready. Start when it's uncomfortable. Start when you have no idea what you're doing. The person you want to become doesn't wait for perfect conditions. They create conditions through action.

Becoming the person you've always wanted to be isn't about a magical transformation. It's about making tiny decisions every day that align with who you're trying to become. Your past doesn't define you. Your current habits do. Change the habits, change the identity. It's that simple and that hard. But it works.",1,1770643606.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

We've hung out three times since then, always in group settings but we always end up talking mostly to each other. She texts me first sometimes, replies quickly when we're chatting, and we've had some deeper conversations about life goals and past relationships. She even suggested we grab coffee just the two of us next week.

I truly hope there's a real sense of community here. Because I've completely lost faith and hope that such a thing exists anywhere...



I most sincerely ask the moderation not to reject my post. Give me a chance to express the storm that has engulfed my heart and soul. Thank you!



I feel like John Coffey. Struck by the pain of reality. Overwhelmed by people, by their bad behavior towards each other, by the cruel scenarios they drag everything living into. By the torture of souls and bodies.



Do you know what it's like? I don't just see it. I feel it. I cry. I'm torn apart from within. And there's no one to hear me. There's no one even to talk to, because people are indoctrinated to talk only about mundane things — work, career, entertainment, possessions...



The world I'm forced to exist in, not by choice but by compulsion, is so brutal and burns me so much that it's hard for me to even put this feeling into words, but despite everything, I will try.



Every day is violence. Every hour, moment, second — pain. I ask myself several times a day how it's possible for an entire humanity to function in such an inhumane and primitive way. How?!



I am a man from Bulgaria, almost 37 years old. The fourth decade is approaching since I've been here, on this condemned planet. In this span of time, I've seen so much bitterness, so much sorrow, so much fear... and I still see and endure all of this... in abundance.



I haven't seen a bright day in this messed-up life, which is anything but life.

I am subjected to economic, social, and all kinds of exclusion. Invisible to women, to my state, to everything that exists.



The rare occasions when someone pretends to notice me and establishes some contact with me, not long after, open demonic behavior begins — behavior of superiority, domination, and authoritarianism. Behavior that deeply hurts me, and when I try to explain this — I receive aggression against myself.



From everywhere, I hear that 'it's my fault' and that 'no one owes me anything,' that my human essence has no value in itself, and the only thing that would make me visible to someone is if I am well-positioned in this world. With a profession. With money. With charisma and charm (imposed standards). Otherwise, I am written off and declared insolvent.



Many men around the world experience this. Mostly young. But already desperate. Because no one sees them, no one sees their pains and struggles, nor shows even elementary interest in their needs. The violence is pervasive, deadly, global.



It's no different with women. But there, the specifics are different. For them, unification consists of being turned into trophies to be conquered, and cosmetic and plastic surgery, media, and social networks constantly bombard them with propaganda about how they should look to be 'marketable' in the relationship market.



That's why they become increasingly artificial, but also increasingly arrogant. Because the matrix of materialism and consumerism has made them think they have a vast sea of choices of all kinds of men at any given moment, while at the same time, a not-insignificant percentage of normal and sensitive men (there are already statistics on male loneliness and isolation) literally perish in oblivion and even commit suicide — some do it slowly through depression, addictions, and other ways, while others quickly and directly.



What kind of world is this that constantly reproduces all this darkness of horrors, violence, and exploitation? What else is it but psychotic and cursed?

Governments feed on pain. On human alienation. On divisions and moral collapse in states and among nations.



Institutions, the press, and authorities are in the hands of total psychopaths with openly maniacal and sick ambitions, as the legendary John Lennon says. They create technologies for climate change, gender change (even in children), abortions, green deals, mass surveillance, digital currencies, and all sorts of other absurdities, aiming to disrupt the natural order and appearance of human beings (and communities)...



But no one deals with world hunger, as a result of which millions of people die every year. In some areas of our planet, children look like skeletons, have no access to clean drinking water, and are grateful even for a cup of rice a day. While in other regions (USA, for example), burger-eating contests are held. Food is wasted... What is this, if not madness?



The world spends TRILLIONS on military purposes and armaments. But says it has no resources to feed the hungry and provide for all living organisms?! Do you understand what a horror of horrors this is?!



Not to mention intentional and mass migration, the transformation of white countries into ghettos, the humiliation that indigenous European peoples and cultures endure and are subjected to. For religious extremism and wars... In the name of religion, profit, conquest.



All of this burns me when I see it, feel it, and realize it. No, I don't just state facts... I feel it as wounds on my own body. This is killing me. Systematically. Methodically. Every day... And every night.



As long as I can remember, I've lived on the edge of survival. In a world that talks about abundance and space travel, I am deprived of even the most basic human needs — food, hot water, peace. Even on cold winter days, I have to roam the streets and collect some scraps to survive another messed-up day.



I also collect cigarette butts from street bins and bus stops. So I have something to smoke, because my nerves can't take it otherwise. Every day is a struggle for survival. And I don't know what life in the true sense of the word is.



I lie down and wake up feeling tired, with body aches, my teeth are crumbling, my heart tightens, my head spins. I've experienced panic attacks, phobia of people, fear of persecution, nightmares, intrusive thoughts, and depression since I was 9-10 years old. That's more than 20 years in this horror. Without the possibility of treatment, deliverance, or an exit.



I have repeatedly been at the mercy of the streets... I know what cold, hunger, rain, fear, and a sense of doom are. I've also been to hospitals (psychiatric), where I witnessed another dose of violence, and where I clearly saw that people are not cured. They just get sicker there. No one cares about them. Even less the staff... Everything is upside down.



Currently, I inhabit a small and miserable attic room in a seaside town in Bulgaria. I am grateful to have a roof over my head, but it's as much a roof as it is my personal cell. Because I have no peace from the noise and reckless behavior of the roommates from the other rooms.



Because I don't even have basic conditions to maintain my needs and hygiene normally. And because no one cares what happens to me and how I'm falling apart.

This city is too dangerous, and the streets abound with hooligans who shout, behave aggressively, and create tension. And every time I have to go out, it's a real nightmare for me. When I return to my room, I cross myself before the icon, with gratitude that I survived today. But I don't know how long I can...



I pay for this apartment with partial assistance, and when I pay my rent + electricity and water, almost nothing is left for me, and again I have to survive with whatever I find on the streets, if I find anything at all. From this, my body weakens more and more. It shows me in every way that it cannot and does not want to be tortured in such a way anymore, and I am forced to torment it... and I cannot give it the rest and peace it desperately needs.



Will you tell me to seek help? Do you think I haven't tried? Since the distant years of 2010-2011, I've been alarming about my situation. I write in newspapers, groups, websites. I've been to public organizations. Do you know what happens? No response from anywhere. And the rare cases when there was some... it was very temporary and short-lived. And then I'm told the familiar 'I need to pull myself together' and go work something, otherwise, life is impossible.



No one asks how, with these pains, with this panic, with this anxiety and sense of horror when among people, I could cope? How? No one knows what's happening in my body and psyche. And that as soon as I have an attack, terrible nausea and vomiting begin — sometimes of stomach acid.



As soon as women find out about my situation, they just disappear. There isn't even a girl I can go out with for a walk, or have a coffee. I'm not a person to them. Because they don't see a 'man' in me according to the imposed criteria, but they see a burden they don't want to bother with. They demand the impossible, but don't even give the most basic support, loyalty, and love...



So many lost years already. From my youth. Over 20 years of fruitless searching for the most natural things here — love, support, selflessness, meaning, loyalty. They are gone. The most natural is the hardest to find.



And everything is tied to money. Even the right to love and be loved, the right to create relationships — the virus of money has penetrated there too. People look at each other as market products in catalogs, not as souls, as the great Creator made us.



How can I exist here? Please tell me!

Where is my place? Where are my kindred spirits?

Where is mercy?



I feel that if all this continues... and if I don't find a way and a chance very soon to leave here and start somewhere fresh, anew... I will destroy myself.

I want to find peace and a place that is not a cell, but a home. I want to heal, to create and build. To love and be loved!

I DO NOT want to just exist, to work, to be a cog in the matrix wheel.



My soul is here with a completely different meaning and purpose.



No human being here, nor animal, should live in conditions of deprivation, fear, and humiliation. Not one. Never. Under any circumstances. This is a fundamental principle for me. Because life is before any economy! Before any damned human stereotypical cliché.



And right now, I again have to think about how to get what no living creature should lack — food.



Not to mention that over the years I saw with my own eyes how homeless people are left to die on city benches. While 'law enforcement officers' mock them and consider them a burden.



That's all from me. For now.



While one percent of the super-rich (a parasitic layer) live in glass capsules and bathe with gold dust shampoos, own private islands and planes... at the same time, millions of other creatures perish in loneliness, deprivation, and misery. Because the same authorities only think of themselves and their personal selfishness.

I now have a freshly broken up with ex girlfriend of 3 years in May. We have had many problems in the relationship some stemming from me and some stemming from her own trauma from her life. We started to live together after a couple weeks of our relationship due to circumstances and at first it was great but deteriorated over time. We ended up moving out to our own spaces, I moved in with my family she moved into a small little basement suite. I recently took a very demanding job that is owning a business under a franchise. I mainly took this job for our life because I wanted to repay the debt of our hard time, make her comfortable and treat her well. Into the late middle of January I went to her house as things were seeming to be going well for her to tell me she wanted to break up. I fought this when in reality I know I should have just said okay and let her figure herself out. I convinced her to go on a break but in reality she couldn’t stick to her guns that night and agreed to the break but didn’t really want to try.

Over the course of the “break” we were very nice to each other, coffee, talking and even texting a-lot etc. it felt like normal. I reached out again one day for coffee and she said no she wanted to breakup. I pleaded on the phone saying we were doing well, life was looking upwards etc which was once again the wrong move (i made the wrong move at every turn). I said let’s do no contact for a week and once again she agreed. Over the no contact break she ended up sleeping with my sister’s ex boyfriend. She never told me, I just figured it out on my own and it felt a move to disrespect me enough to just cut her off but sadly my heart was still open to her. The last night of no contact I knocked on his door while she was over, he shoved me away threatened to call the cops and I threw lots of words at him. I still forgive her for some reason and I still firmly believe he just has no morals to try and fuck up siblings that he has now intertwined their relationship grieving. 

We spoke the next day on Saturday, I was very accountable for my mistakes over our relationship, but I broke in the middle of it telling her my heart cannot close to her. Despite feeling cheated on when she doesn’t, despite feeling the sacrifices in my life I made for her, the disrespectful behaviour over our break the love for her still sat with me and I just tried to make her see the light. We drove away from each other leaving it with “I love you, you know” both ways and then promptly after she left I was blocked on every social platform, my sister was blocked by her as well. He blocked me as well after I apologized to him very accountably before even knocking on his door. The first day she went to his home I texted him and said “are you fucking kidding me”. I got guilted into a false narrative of what really happened that night at the time so I wanted to apologize. He blocked me for saying sorry. 

Post breakup I left her a voicemail saying why was I blocked, I cant respect something that feels so counter intuitive to the in person conversation we just had about our past almost 3 years. After 2 days of clarity I used my eSIM to send a massive message saying that constructiveness and reconciliation was still a viable option for our situation and that I don’t respect some of her choices made but the love is still there for her. That I was willing to forgive her. She then blocked the eSIM without reading it (I know I should not have done that)

I feel like my whole life just took a loop, I burned a lot of money on her in the last couple months, took on career hardship and tried so hard to make our lives well but it still ended. Im back at my parents again, without her. She had 2 cats that genuinely felt like my pets as well by that point and now they are gone too. Wouldn’t even give me the respect of seeming them once more. I genuinely feel like death, every waking minute I think of what I should have done, why him?, why couldn’t she see not the “potential” of me and not the active steps being taking to make our lives good, why does she feel like every message I sent her was a bullet instead of a flower gesturing how much I care, it makes me want to stop breathing, this situation has really messed me up. 

I feel like my dignity is gone for pushing to fix that relationship, Its hard to eat, speak to friends, do my job you name it. ",1,1770643193.0,BreakUps,4,1.0,False

I’ve been using mostly hand-me-down furniture (couch, coffee/side tables, game table chairs) while I figured out the layout, but the current setup just isn’t working.

The couch feels too heavy for the room, but I also have a doodle whose favorite activity is couch parkour after a long walk in the rain or snow 🙃. Whatever couch I replace this with needs to be durable, easy to clean, cozy, and still let's her do her thang.

**My goals:**

1. Allow more light flow into the room
2. Maximize seating for when family is over with permanent or moveable seating options
3. Keep it comfortable enough for my fiancé, who loves to fully lay down while watching TV (which makes a sectional feel necessary. I’m not in love with them, but it’s either that, or nowhere for me and the pup to sit while he lays)
4. Maintain a cozy, ambient vibe without making the room dark

**What I’m stuck on:**

1. Best layout for this longish, narrow room to get maximum seating (dims are approx 20L x 13’W with the staircase coming out about 8’ of the room width)
2. Couch shape, size, orientation
3. Ideas for the game table corner which needs equal amounts of love

To think you're important, is to think like a fool.

Dawn comes for us all. Find your breath... or suffocate.



**Prologue**

I enlisted for two years, twenty weeks. It was the shortest enlistment that I could find and it wasn't infantry. I was hoping for a cushy desk job or a quiet gate to skate by for two years of my enlistment. I only needed a job with benefits, and a way to escape from a decaying life at home. I threw a Hail Mary and I was the football being thrown wildly into fate's hands. Was I lucky? You can be the judge.

  


**Part I - The Routine and the Pull**



**Friday** 

Panama, 1991, approximately five miles from Fort Davis.

In a three-story building next to the old hospital at Coco Solo, better known as the Lone Coconut, I jolted awake, bolting to sit upright as if an internal alarm had detonated in my skull. It was always abrupt, like a shot of adrenaline straight to my soul. I sensed the dawn creeping in, and with it, the same relentless cycle. It begins again, as it always does.

I faded into the morning haze with the jungle’s steaminess pressing against the metal-framed windows like an external presence constantly fighting to get inside. The air conditioner hummed and clunked along, fighting a losing battle against the heat and humidity from outside. I shared this two-man room with Scott, the night-shift dispatcher at the Provost Marshal’s Office. I had gotten here first, so I claimed the window. He was stuck near the door, closer to the hallway noise.

For a brief second, I forgot where I was. The peace that sleep afforded me flickered away like a shadow fleeing the light. I rubbed my eyes hard with the heels of my palms, forcing the pressure back into my head. As I did, the details of my reality flooded back into my consciousness. The unattended child back home, the ex-wife, the money hemorrhaging out, and the endless months of this tour stretching ahead like a lifetime sentence when you’re young. The dread settled back in. I could feel the thickness of the weight throughout my body. The drum of my heartbeat pounding in my head, like a daily hangover.

I leaned over to my nightstand, grabbing my wristwatch. Shit, it was 04:53. I woke up later than usual. Luckily, Scott wouldn’t drag in until 06:15, so I wouldn’t have to hear his bitching about my smoking in the room again. I sat up on the edge of my twin bed. I snatched my half-soft pack of Marlboro Reds from the nightstand. I balanced the battered gold-plated Zippo that was lying on top of the pack. I removed a cigarette with my teeth and, with a smooth flick of muscle memory, flicked open my lighter, igniting my cigarette. At that moment, I decided it was going to be a good day. A deep inhale of smoke confirmed it. I took stock of the incoming day. Then I noticed that I had slept in my jeans again and on top of the covers. I hated making my bed, so I rarely covered up. I stared blankly through the double windows. I could see the jungle foliage rustling in the steady breeze outside and made note of the condensation streaking down the glass like vertical tears.

In my daily routine, I made note of my time left here in this place. My quick math in my head spat out six and a half months down, seventeen and a half to go on this tour of duty. It felt eternal, but I gave myself short goals to look forward to. So I declared it was going to be a quiet weekend, a good weekend. I told myself, if I said it, it must be true.

I was twenty-one years old. If I had to describe my looks, I was nondescript: nearly six foot one, brown hair, hazel eyes, pushing two hundred pounds. I was considered fat for the Army, but I carried it well with broad shoulders. I lived in the off-post barracks at Coco Solo, next to the old hospital. Only detachment military police personnel from the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, Law Enforcement Activity—better known as HHC, LEA—from Fort Clayton on the Pacific side lived in the barracks. We did have a few incoming senior NCOs staying with us as geo-bachelors until their housing was ready for them and their families to join. Coco Solo was US-controlled land on the Atlantic side of Panama. No fences, no guards, just a short road off the highway next to the old hospital, with a couple of bilingual warning signs to warn trespassers.

I tended to linger and daydream too much. I sighed and scanned my open wall locker for clothes to wear today. My battle dress uniforms hung in the wall locker inside transparent plastic dry-cleaning bags, mostly untouched. I had only worn them a few times. My daily wardrobe was usually dirty because I had to recycle them fast. I only had a few items. I never hung them up because they seemed to be constantly dirty unless I caught our barracks maid to wash them for me. I sifted through the wadded items on the bottom of the locker. I triaged and decided on a dark green T-shirt and a bright orange-and-yellow Hawaiian shirt. I threaded my brown leather belt through my jean loops, attaching my holster to the center of my back. I tucked my T-shirt in while keeping the Hawaiian shirt hanging open to hide the handgun holster. This was my daily outfit. As I bent over, I felt the pressure in my head pounding harder, and I could feel my face flush. I made another mental note that I needed coffee soon.

I took a slow, deep drag off my cigarette and exhaled it as I leaned down to fish out my worn Nikes out from under the bed. My socks were already tucked inside of them. As I slipped my socks on, I noticed a fresh bruise on my right ankle from my metal footboard again. I was too tall for this twin bed. I had to sleep catty-cornered or poke my feet through the bars of the footboard to fit on the bed. Welcome to my hell.

With my cigarette dangling, I slipped into the pre-tied shoes. I had only ever tied them once. When I first bought them, I tied them tight. Then I slipped them on for the life of the shoe. After a few good coughs and hacks that cleared my head, I stood up. I walked by Scott’s pristine side. It was always dress-right-dress, as usual. Good for him. I cupped my hand around my lit cigarette because smoking in common areas was forbidden. Out into the hallway. Right turn, down to the end into the shared bathroom. It was empty this early in the morning. I took a quick piss before heading out. I noticed it was dark yellow, another reminder why I felt like shit. As I was leaving the bathroom, I took one last cursory look into the mirror. I saw my hair was too long with a light beard coming in, and my general look was disheveled. My judgment was that I was fine and ready for the world. Time to report for duty.

Back into the hallway and down the stairs, I dug into my right front pocket for my car keys. They were entangled with my Balboa coins within my pocket. As I emerged from the building's side door onto the parking lot facing the hospital, I spotted my government-owned vehicle, or GOV. It was a midnight-blue four-door Toyota Corolla with blacked-out tinted windows. I could never remember exactly where I parked it last, so I had a habit of scanning the area. While I walked toward my car, I took a quick inspection of the exterior, then slid in. I immediately took the Ray-Bans down from the visor, followed by snatching up the warm Mountain Dew can in the middle console to enjoy the last swig of soda. I lowered the driver's side window as I pulled out. I flicked the cigarette butt onto the wet morning lawn. At the end of the driveway, I turned right onto the main road toward Colón. Colón was seven miles away. But I was going to Fort Davis, which was four miles away. I did love Colón; it was called the second city because it was the second largest city in Panama. I started to hype myself up for the day. I cranked the radio up and drove with the windows down.

This is a chronicle of a weekend in a life that I had lived, so far from home and on my own.

“There it was—did you hear it?”

I didn’t hear anything other than the dog snoring on the floor.

“No, I don’t hear it.”

She threw the covers back and started up.

“I’m going to see what it is.”

I lay there half-aware of what was happening.

“No, no, I’ll go look.”

The night air hit me as I opened the front door. Its chill sent shivers down my legs. Stepping out onto the porch, I strained my ears.

Standing there in my underwear, the only thing I heard was crickets.

When I was convinced that nothing was screaming, I went back inside.

“There wasn’t any screaming.”

“I know there was,” she said adamantly.

“Well, there wasn’t any when I was outside, so I don’t know what else to say.”

The next day I made a point to ask my neighbor Eric if he had heard anything. Alice was certain that the screaming was coming from the direction of Eric’s house.

Eric had moved in the previous month, another story of divorce. He came by a couple of times to borrow this or that, but for the most part he kept to himself.

I knocked on his door. I was taken aback by the way he looked. Tired was an understatement.

“Hey, you okay?”

“Yeah, just a little cold. I’ll feel better tomorrow. What can I do for you?”

“Well, Alice thought she heard screaming last night. She won’t let it go. Did you hear anything?”

“She probably heard me throwing up. I was up half the night with it.”

He blew his nose. The toilet paper came away red.

“Oh shit, I better go.”

“Yeah, feel better, man.”

I came home after work that afternoon. Alice was sitting in the kitchen reading the paper.

“Hey honey, how was work?”

“It was—Jared was on my ass all day.”

“Oh, that’s not good. Why?”

“The rebranding that I’ve been stressing about, remember?”

Her face pinched in concentration. “Oh yeah. I’m sorry. Just tired, I guess.”

“You couldn’t go back to sleep last night?”

“Not really.”

I was watching her as she continued to browse the sports section. Don’t get me wrong—Alice was a big football fan, but she had never been one for box scores.

“You should’ve taken a nap today.”

“I was going to, but Eric stopped by to apologize. He said he was sick last night and he must’ve been the noise we heard.”

“He didn’t look too good when I saw him this morning.”

“Oh yeah, he looked dreadful, but I invited him in for some lunch and he seemed better when he left.”

Dinner was light that night. I wasn’t in the mood for anything heavy, and Alice said that she was still full from lunch.

Randy, our chocolate lab, usually begged for food no matter what we had, but he didn’t come into the dining room. I held out part of my sandwich and still he only sniffed, then gave me a pitiful look.

“Has Randy been weird all day?” I asked Alice.

“No, he’s been fine. Why?”

“He’s just not in here begging. I wonder if he’s sick.”

“Maybe he needs to go out. I’ll put him out back.”

Alice walked toward Randy. He whimpered, backing away.

“Come on, Randy. Let’s go outside.”

He continued to back away.

Alice grabbed him by the collar and started to lead him, but he snapped out at her hand.

I yelled at him as I jumped up off my chair. He ran back to his bed. I grabbed some paper towels, expecting a mess of blood. There wasn’t—he had got her pretty good, but she was hardly bleeding.

“He didn’t get me that bad,” she laughed.

I gave her the paper towels and put Randy in the backyard. I pulled the first aid kit from the guest bathroom and wrapped Alice’s hand. It had already stopped bleeding, but I figured it was better to be safe.

That night Randy slept in the guest bedroom, because his behavior was still strange toward Alice—the person that had been his number one for six years.

I felt the bed shift. I looked over; it was 3:15 in the morning. Alice wasn’t in bed. I was getting up to go look for her, but I dozed and fell back off.

I heard our faucet turn on. I looked at the clock again—it was 4:30.

“What’re you doing?” I asked, three-quarters still asleep.

“Just had to use the bathroom.”

She kissed me.

I recoiled slightly. Her breath was rank and coppery.

“What’s wrong?” Her face was empty.

“Something smells bad.”

“Randy used the bathroom in the house. That’s probably what you’re smelling.”

I nodded and dropped back off.

Alice was already in the kitchen when I walked in. She was dressed for December in April.

I made some coffee and offered her some; she waved her hand in refusal. Randy was usually laid out by her side in the mornings, but he was missing.

“Where’s Randy?”

“I put him outside,” she said flatly.

“Are you okay?”

She turned and smiled.

“Yeah, I’m fine.”

“You sure?”

“Yeah, I’m fine. Really.”

“Is Randy okay?”

She turned back, staring at the window.

“Yeah, I think he’s going to be just fine now.”

I grabbed my stuff and headed for work. Outside, I did a double take. Eric’s car had gone.

Alice said Randy had escaped while I was at work. She had tried to walk him, but he slipped his leash. Though in the six years we had him, he had only ever been walked a handful of times. We had fenced in our backyard so that he could run around out there.

I spent that evening knocking on doors and canvassing the neighbors. None of them had seen Randy. I put up posters, but after a week he still hadn’t shown up, or even a clue shared about where he was.

Alice also started wearing more perfume as the days passed. The floral notes blended with a sick, sweet odor. Her nails had also become black and earthen.

As the days fed into May, the heat picked up outside. This also brought a new level of stress. Eric’s car hadn’t returned. Alice and I had begun sleeping in separate bedrooms. I begged her to let me understand what was happening with her. She would always smile and say nothing was wrong, and by the last week of April I couldn’t stand the smell of her. There was also a new smell that kept sweeping through the house whenever the air conditioning came on.

It smelled of hamburger left in the sun. I couldn’t take it anymore. I made plans to go camping with a couple of my friends that weekend.

I needed my tent from the attic. When I pulled the rope, the smell fell on me with putrid weight. I climbed the ladder, choking with each step. As I reached the top, I heard a squelch coming from the corner. A dry heave wracked my body. The sound stopped. There was a shuffle.",3,1770641756.0,scarystories,0,0.81,False

when the brain gets a win.

Not later.  
Not someday.  
Immediately.

The mistake most people make  
is delaying the reward.  
They expect motivation to come first  
and satisfaction to follow.

The disciplined reverse it.

Right after the habit,  
they give themselves something small.

A checkmark on a tracker.  
A deep breath and a smile.  
A sip of coffee.  
A favorite song.

Nothing big.  
Just enough to signal:  
“That mattered.”

The reward doesn’t need to be external.  
It needs to be instant.

Your brain learns through timing.  
Action. Reward. Repeat.

When the reward is immediate,  
the habit wires faster.  
When it’s delayed,  
the habit stays optional.

So finish the habit  
and immediately mark it as a win.

Acknowledge it.  
Enjoy it.  
Lock it in.

You’re not bribing yourself.  
You’re training your brain.

And trained brains repeat behaviors  
without negotiation.

Do the habit.  
Reward it instantly.  
Let repetition do the rest.

1r03g43,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1r03g43/issues_with_preground_passalacqua_harem/,Issues with preground Passalacqua Harem,"I'm having issues with getting a proper flow with preground Passalacqua Harem. Instead of a normal slow and steady flow, it feels like it's trying really hard to push out and it only flows in one side, and even if I leave it on the heat the whole time, it won't gush, which it would've done using the other coffee grounds I've used.

I'm fairly new to moka pot brewing and have so far been highly successful with a preground Lavazza Qualita Rossa and another preground from a local Italian café. I always fill the gasket to the top, tapping but not tamping. Both were fairly coarse compared to the Passalacqua Harem. I don't know what an espresso grind should be like so I can't tell if this is how fine it is, but the resellers say it's suitable for moka pot.

So, based on that information, **I've concluded the issue must be because of the finer ground of the Harem, but I've also learned that the Harem is a very oily coffee, so that could also be the reason**. I've read about people having no issues using even espresso grinds in a moka pot.

What I've tried so far is to fill the gasket to 70-80% instead of full, but no success. The reason was that I was told it could be that a finer grounds will expand more when it absorbs water and become too hard.

I've read that it can help using filters to avoid clogging, but I don't really want to use filters, as it will impact the flavor/body of the coffee. I've been thinking of trying to put another coarser coffee in the bottom to avoid it getting clogged and maybe at the top too, but don't know if it will solve anything. And I'm not sure if a WDT would be helpful, it's also been recommended in order to create air pockets to give the water paths to flow, but I don't want to invest in things that I may not need.

Does anyone have experience with this particular bean, or have you also had the same issue and solved it somehow?

Please don't tell me ""it's too fine"", that's already understood. I want a solution to work around it!

1r03f6d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r03f6d,"Launching IOS version of my journaling app today, privacy first approach","just released jourlo on ios testflight today

been working on this for a few months. it's a journaling app but built around privacy everything stays on your device, nothing gets uploaded anywhere  


**how it works**

instead of blank pages, you start with quick mood check

then add whatever context you want text, photos, voice notes, location  
over time it shows you patterns about yourself

like realizing you're stressed every sunday, or productive at coffee shops but not home, or happy on specific days for reasons you didn't notice before



**what's in it**

*  mood tracking
*  journaling books to organize different parts of life (work, personal, travel, etc)
*  voice journaling for when typing feels like too much
*  location tracking optional
*  pattern analytics
*  everything stored locally

**why mobile matters**

had a web version running but let's be real, journaling happens on phones

so rebuilt it native for ios

testflight went live today search ""**Jourlo**"" if you want to check it out (if you didn't find it let know i'll help yoou) 

still ironing out some rough edges before full launch but it's functional

android coming after ios is stable

1r03eda,https://i.redd.it/bo5o7ke6ugig1.jpeg,Never Miss a Beat: Setting Up Sound & Desktop Notifications for Claude Code on Linux,"If you've been using Anthropic's Claude Code — the AI-powered agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal — you've probably run into one frustrating problem: **you walk away while Claude is working, come back ten minutes later, and realize it's been sitting there waiting for your input the whole time.**

I decided to fix this once and for all. Here's exactly how I set up audio alerts and desktop notifications on my Linux machine so Claude Code beeps and pops up a notification the moment it needs me.

# The Problem: Staring at a Terminal

Claude Code is incredibly capable. It reads your codebase, plans multi-step tasks, writes code, runs commands, and self-corrects — all autonomously. A single prompt can keep it busy for several minutes.

That's great for productivity, but it creates a new problem: **when do you check back?**

My first instinct was to write a hacky shell loop:

    while true; do
      afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Ping.aiff
      sleep 300
    done

This is the wrong approach. It beeps every 5 minutes regardless of what Claude is doing — whether it's busy working or already done. It's noise, not signal.

What I actually wanted was **event-driven notifications** — a sound that plays *only* when Claude finishes a task or is waiting for my input.

# The Solution: Claude Code Hooks

Turns out, Claude Code has a built-in **hooks system** — a way to run shell commands at specific lifecycle events. Two events are particularly useful:

* `Notification` — Fires when Claude is waiting for user input or needs permission to continue.
* `Stop` — Fires when Claude finishes responding.

These are exactly the two moments I care about. No polling. No timers. Just a clean event-driven alert.

# Step-by-Step Setup on Linux

# Step 1: Verify Your System Has the Right Tools

Before configuring anything, I checked whether my system could play sounds and show desktop notifications:

    # Test desktop notifications
    notify-send ""Test"" ""Hello""
    
    # Test audio playback
    paplay /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/bell.oga
    
    # Find available system sounds
    find /usr/share/sounds/ -type f 2>/dev/null | head -10

On my Ubuntu system, both `notify-send` and `paplay` were available out of the box. The system had several `.oga` sound files in `/usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/`, including `bell.oga` and `complete.oga` — perfect for distinguishing between ""needs input"" and ""task done.""

If `notify-send` isn't installed on your system:

    sudo apt install libnotify-bin

# Step 2: Create the Settings File

Claude Code reads its configuration from `~/.claude/settings.json`. I created the directory and file:

    mkdir -p ~/.claude
    nano ~/.claude/settings.json

# Step 3: Add the Hook Configuration

Here's the configuration I used:

    {
      ""preferredNotifChannel"": ""terminal_bell"",
      ""hooks"": {
        ""Notification"": [
          {
            ""matcher"": """",
            ""hooks"": [
              {
                ""type"": ""command"",
                ""command"": ""paplay /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/bell.oga & notify-send 'Claude Code' 'Waiting for your input'""
              }
            ]
          }
        ],
        ""Stop"": [
          {
            ""matcher"": """",
            ""hooks"": [
              {
                ""type"": ""command"",
                ""command"": ""paplay /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/complete.oga & notify-send 'Claude Code' 'Task completed'""
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }

A few things to note:

* The `matcher"": """"` (empty string) means the hook fires on all events of that type. You could narrow it down to specific events like `idle_prompt` or `permission_prompt` if you want finer control.
* I used **different sounds** for each event — `bell.oga` for ""needs input"" and `complete.oga` for ""task done"" — so I can tell them apart without looking at my screen.
* The `&` after `paplay` runs the sound in the background so it doesn't block the notification.
* The `preferredNotifChannel: ""terminal_bell""` is a bonus — it also enables the terminal's built-in bell character as a fallback.

# Step 4: Restart Claude Code

After saving the file, I closed and reopened Claude Code. The hooks loaded automatically.

# Step 5: Test It

I gave Claude a simple task (`echo a`) and waited. The moment Claude finished and was ready for my next prompt — **a desktop notification popped up saying ""Task completed""** along with the completion sound.

No more staring at the terminal. No more wasted minutes.

# Troubleshooting: When Audio Doesn't Play from Hooks

During my setup, I hit a snag: `notify-send` worked fine from the hook, but `paplay` didn't produce any sound. The notification appeared, but no audio.

This happens because hooks run in a subprocess that may not inherit your PulseAudio session. The fix is to explicitly set the PulseAudio socket:

    ""command"": ""PULSE_SERVER=unix:/run/user/$(id -u)/pulse/native paplay /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/bell.oga & notify-send 'Claude Code' 'Waiting for your input'""

If PulseAudio still doesn't cooperate, here are alternative sound commands:

|Method|Command|
|:-|:-|
|**ALSA directly**|`aplay /usr/share/sounds/speech-dispatcher/test.wav`|
|**SOX**|`play /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/bell.oga`|
|**Speaker beep**|`beep` (install with `sudo apt install beep`)|
|**Sine tone**|`speaker-test -t sine -f 1000 -l 1 -p 200`|

Test each one directly in your terminal, then plug the one that works into your hook config.

# Alternative: The /hooks Interactive Menu

If editing JSON feels tedious, Claude Code also has an interactive hook setup. Just type `/hooks` inside a Claude Code session, and it walks you through:

1. Selecting the event type (Notification, Stop, etc.)
2. Setting a matcher pattern
3. Entering your shell command

It's a nice way to get started quickly and then fine-tune the JSON later.

# Going Further: Ideas for Power Users

Once you have the basics working, you can extend this pattern in several ways:

**Different sounds per event type:** Use the `matcher` field to play a distinct sound for permission prompts vs. idle prompts:

    {
      ""matcher"": ""permission_prompt"",
      ""hooks"": [{ ""type"": ""command"", ""command"": ""paplay /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/dialog-warning.oga & notify-send 'Claude Code' 'Permission needed'"" }]
    },
    {
      ""matcher"": ""idle_prompt"",
      ""hooks"": [{ ""type"": ""command"", ""command"": ""paplay /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/complete.oga & notify-send 'Claude Code' 'Ready for input'"" }]
    }

**Voice announcements:** If you have `espeak` or `festival` installed:

    espeak ""Claude Code is waiting"" &

**Log notifications for review:** Append every notification to a log file so you can see how long tasks took:

    echo ""$(date '+%H:%M:%S') - Task completed"" >> ~/.claude/notification.log && notify-send 'Claude Code' 'Task completed'

**Webhook to your phone:** For truly long-running tasks, use a service like ntfy.sh to push notifications to your mobile:

    curl -s -d ""Claude Code finished a task"" ntfy.sh/your-topic &

# The Bigger Picture

This is a small quality-of-life improvement, but it fundamentally changes how you interact with Claude Code. Instead of **you watching Claude**, Claude now **watches for you**.

You fire off a complex task — refactoring a module, writing tests, debugging a pipeline — and go do something else. Read documentation. Review a PR. Grab a coffee. When Claude needs you, it reaches out.

That's the real promise of agentic AI tools. Not just that they do the work, but that they integrate into your flow without demanding constant attention.

A five-minute setup. A permanent productivity upgrade.

# Quick Reference

**Minimal setup (just edit this file):**

File: `~/.claude/settings.json`

    {
      ""hooks"": {
        ""Notification"": [
          {
            ""matcher"": """",
            ""hooks"": [
              {
                ""type"": ""command"",
                ""command"": ""notify-send 'Claude Code' 'Needs your input'""
              }
            ]
          }
        ],
        ""Stop"": [
          {
            ""matcher"": """",
            ""hooks"": [
              {
                ""type"": ""command"",
                ""command"": ""notify-send 'Claude Code' 'Task completed'""
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }

**Prerequisites:** `sudo apt install libnotify-bin` (if not already installed)

**Test it:** Run Claude Code, give it any task, and wait for the notification to appear.

We produce very small batches of RTD coffee, which we filter and can. We’ve been asked hundreds of times by coffee shops and other small supermarkets (there’s no other RTD coffee in our country) if we could sell it outside of our brewery.

So we are checking if there is somehow a way we can get this done without doing a million dollar investment. (We live in a very small country and would never pay off) 

I know best and only 100% secure way would be a rotart, that having said what could be another way? 

The idea would be to achieve a 60 day refrigerated product. (we have cold distribution and would only sell to few clients that we know would keep it refrigerated too.) 

Option 1: Could an autoclave do the job of a retort ? 

 Option 2: tunnel-pasteurize the cans and then send samples to the lab to check for bacteria, yeast, mold, etc. This would give us a general idea (since we would just get some random cans out of the line to check) 

Option 3: Preservatives: Is there even any preservatives that could do the work ? We are at such high PH (4.8-5.0) that im not sure anything would work. 

If not, does anyone know of a small retort we quote — something that can handle a couple hundred cans per day?

1r03dt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1r03dt9/if_anyone_has_seen_an_elderly_woman_about_16/,"if anyone has seen an elderly woman about 1.6 meters tall, with a gray bob haircut pls massage me","It all started four weeks ago when my mother-in-law had a heart attack.

It was a Tuesday evening. We received a call from the hospital around seven o'clock. They said her condition was moderate. She needed close monitoring, lifestyle changes, stress reduction, and someone to help with housework during her recovery. My husband was devastated. He's an only child; his father died six years ago, so his mother was his only family. Before the doctor even finished explaining the treatment plan, my husband was already making arrangements for what would happen next.

""She’ll be staying with us,"" he announced in the hospital corridor, his tone more like a statement than a question.

I didn’t say no. How could I? She was his mother. She had  a heart attack. She was sixty-three, lived alone in a two-story house, and her doctor had told her to ""rest,"" not climb stairs,"" and ""have someone with her."" I’m not heartless. I have a conscience, even if her heart is broken at this moment.

""Of course,"" I said. ""She should stay with us until she needs to.""

That was my first mistake.

Let me introduce my mother-in-law. Her name was Barbara, but she insisted everyone call her Barb. She wasn't tall, probably only about 1.6 meters even with orthotic shoes, with a neat bob haircut of gray hair and a pair of reading glasses strung on a beaded chain around her neck. Before retiring, she had worked as a school librarian for thirty-three years. Every Wednesday, she volunteered at an animal shelter. She also knitted blankets for premature babies at the hospital. In every way, she was a saint.

On Thursday, she moved in, carrying a small wheeled suitcase and a canvas bag full of medicine. She was pale, walked with a limp, and pressed one hand tightly to her chest, as if protecting her heart. She thanked us repeatedly, her eyes welling up as she hugged our son, saying she didn't want to be a burden.

For the first five days, she behaved perfectly. Quiet, grateful, almost unnoticed. She spent most of her time in the guest room, either reading or taking naps. Occasionally, when she came out, she would sit in the kitchen, a cup of herbal tea in hand, softly asking if we needed any help, insisting she felt fine and could fold clothes or chop vegetables. My husband looked at her with that tender, concerned gaze, making me feel guilty for all the negative thoughts I had ever had about her.

I was actually quite satisfied with this arrangement. See, I told myself, you can do it. You can be a good daughter-in-law. That's how family should be.

Then, Monday came.

I'm a medical consultant, working from home three days a week. The job is very stressful and demanding. I have to talk to executives on the phone, report data to the board, and manage the logistics of clinical trials. That day was Monday, and I had three consecutive video conferences starting at nine in the morning, one of which was with a notoriously difficult client who had already canceled my meetings twice.

I was late. I overslept, the coffee machine broke, and I spilled toothpaste on my only clean shirt. I was running around , my hair still wet, frantically searching for notes, when it suddenly dawned on me that I'd completely forgotten to prepare lunch for my son. I felt utterly terrible.

My son, Sam, is seven years old. He has a severe, life-threatening allergy to peanuts and nuts. Not the kind that just causes rashes or a slight itch, but the kind that makes his throat swell and stops him from breathing. We keep EpiPen everywhere: in the kitchen, in the car, in his classroom, the school nurse's office, in my bag. We've repeatedly told every teacher, his friends' parents, every babysitter, and practically everyone within ten feet of him: no peanuts, no nuts, read the labels carefully, check every ingredient—there's no room for negotiation.

The school knows too. His lunchbox has a medical warning label. He doesn't eat in the cafeteria, he eats in the library, because that's the nut-free section. His friends know not to share food with him. We've built a whole system of safeguards around his safety.

At 8:47, I stood in the kitchen, staring at the empty lunchbox on the counter, listening to the beeping of my laptop upstairs. My first meeting was about to start in three minutes.

Barbara sat at the kitchen table, slowly spreading butter on a slice of toast, her pill bottles neatly arranged in front of her like rows of orange soldiers.

""I’m so embarrassed to ask,"" I said, grabbing my laptop bag, ""but I’m about to collapse. Could you prepare lunch for Sam? There’s turkey in the fridge, bread in the pantry, and some baby carrots, cheese sticks, and apple slices. His lunchbox is over there.""

She looked up at me with those kind, grandmotherly eyes. ""Of course, dear. I’d love to.""

""Thank you so much, you’re a lifesaver."" I was about to go upstairs when I stopped and turned back. This was important;  ""Oh, and Barb, this is really, really important. Sam has a severe peanut allergy, the kind that requires an adrenaline injector, the kind that requires hospitalization. So, please, please, don't put peanuts in his lunch, anything containing peanuts, anything that might have come into contact with peanuts. Just turkey and other safe foods, okay?""

She gave him a warm, reassuring smile. ""I completely understand, darling. Don't worry, don't put peanuts in.""

""Thank you.""

I should have stayed. I should have watched her do it. I should have checked Sam's lunchbox before he left for school. But I was already four minutes late, and I could hear the phone ringing upstairs; the boss was on the phone, so I had to run over.

The school was calling at 11:41.

I was giving a presentation on the results of a phase 3 clinical trial when my phone started vibrating on the table. The first time I ignored it. The second time, I looked down and saw it was Sam's school calling. My heart sank.

I muted the microphone halfway through my sentence, mumbled an apology, said it was urgent, and answered the phone.

""Mrs. Carter, this is Diane from the school nurse’s office."" Her voice carried that quality every parent fears—that cautious, restrained calm that implies something terrible has happened, yet they try not to panic. ""Sam is fine, but we need you to come pick him up right away. He’s having an allergic reaction.""

The room tilted.

""What?"" My voice sounded unlike my own. ""What do you mean? What happened?""

""He ate something with peanuts in his lunch. He immediately vomited it up, and then the symptoms started. We gave him diphenhydramine and put him on an inhaler. He’s stable now, but according to our procedure, he needs to go home for observation. Thank goodness we didn’t have to use an adrenaline injector, but it was a close call.""

I don’t remember how I hung up. I don’t remember telling my colleague I had to go. I only remember grabbing my keys and running to the car, my hands shaking so badly I could barely insert the ignition switch.

On the drive, I called my husband six times. Each time, it went to voicemail. I remembered he'd been in meetings all day, giving an important report. His phone was off.

When I arrived at school, I was wearing slippers—I'd forgotten to change—and ran through the hallway to the school infirmary.

Sam sat on the examination table, looking small and frightened, his face red and swollen, his eyes bloodshot, his hands clutching the inhaler tightly. He burst into tears the moment he saw me.

I held him for a long time, feeling his rapid heartbeat, breathing in the scent of his hair, thinking about how we'd almost lost him.

Diana waited patiently for a while, then showed him his lunchbox.

Inside was a thick piece of homemade peanut brittle, carefully wrapped in wax paper, as if someone had meticulously prepared it.

I stared at it, feeling like the whole world was so far away.

""We don’t have peanut brittle at home,"" I heard myself say. ""We’ve never had it, and we never will.""

""Did he get it from another student?"" Diana asked softly.

Sam shook his head and wiped his nose. ""It was in my lunch. I thought it was some kind of butterscotch. I was starving, and Mrs. Paterson was sick today and couldn't check my food, so I just took a bite without looking.

I looked at the peanut brittle again. It was obviously homemade. Someone had made it from scratch. A lot of work—cooking the sugar, corn syrup, butter, and peanuts together, letting it cool and solidify, cutting it into neat little squares, and wrapping it up.

Only Barbara had packed him lunch.

I drove Sam home silently, my mind a jumble. Once in the driveway, I told him to come upstairs and rest, that he could watch whatever he wanted, and I'd get him ice cream in a bit. He nodded, still looking distracted, and dragged his heavy steps upstairs.

I found Barbara in the living room, sitting in an armchair by the window doing crosswords.

""Did you put the peanut brittle in Sam's lunchbox?"" I asked.

She looked up and blinked gently. ""Oh, yes."" ""I made it last night. I thought he might like a special lunch.""

I waited. I waited for her to realize, for a look of horror to cross her face, for an apology, for any sign that she understood what she had done.

Nothing.

""He's allergic to peanuts,"" I said slowly, carefully, as if explaining something to a very young child. ""I told you this morning. I made it very clear. I said please don't put peanuts in his lunch because he has a severe allergy.""

She frowned slightly and tilted her head. ""You said that? I don't remember.""

""Of course I did. I made it very clear. I said he has a severe allergy, needs an adrenaline injector, and might even need to be hospitalized.""

""Hmm."" She tapped her crossword puzzle with her pen. ""I must not have heard you properly.""

""He almost stopped breathing. The school had to give him medication. I had to take time off to pick him up.""

""Oh, my goodness."" She pressed her hand to her chest. ""That was terrible. Is he alright now?""

""He’s upstairs. He was terrified.""

""Yeah, I’m sure he was scared. Kids are so sensitive.""

I stood there, waiting for her to apologize, but she didn’t.

""These things happen,"" she finally said, then looked down and continued doing her crossword puzzle. ""I believe he’ll be alright."" ""

These things happen.

My son almost had an anaphylactic shock, and these things do happen.

I went upstairs, locked myself in the bathroom, and cried for twenty minutes.

When my husband came home at 6:30, I had been waiting for him. I spent hours preparing what to say, organizing my thoughts, and constructing my arguments.

I told him everything. I showed him the peanut candy, still lying quietly in Sam's lunchbox like evidence at a crime scene. I explained what the nurse had said, how dangerous the situation was, how terrified our son was, and how he almost died.

He listened, his expression growing increasingly tense and weary.

""She said she forgot,"" I continued, ""she said she didn't remember me telling her the child was allergic to peanut candy, but I specifically told her before I left, I made it very clear.""

He rubbed his eyes. ""She probably just forgot.""

I stared at him.

""She's sixty-three, just had a heart attack, and is now taking some new medication that might affect her memory."" ""She probably just meant well, wanted to make something nice for the child, and then forgot.""

""I told her this morning.""

""She's probably very upset about it.""

""She isn't. I talked to her. She didn't apologize. She said, 'These things happen,' and then went back to her crossword puzzle.""

He sighed, the kind of sigh he only made when he felt I was being unreasonable. ""I believe she'll process this in her own way. People her age, especially after a serious illness, sometimes have a hard time expressing their emotions.""

""She almost killed your son.""

""It was an accident.""

""Really?""

He looked at me sharply. ""What do you mean by that?""

""Nothing, don't worry about it.""

""No, be clear. Are you implying my mother intentionally hurt Sam?""

""I mean, I gave her a very simple, very important instruction, and she completely did the opposite, which is strange."" ""She forgot. This isn’t the same as deliberately doing the opposite.""

""Okay.""

""We’ll talk to her. We’ll make sure she understands the seriousness of this and that it won’t happen again.""

He went to talk to her. I could hear them speaking quietly in the living room; his voice was patient and gentle, hers soft and apologetic. He came back saying she was very upset about the whole thing and promised to be more careful next time.

I didn’t believe him, but I was too tired to argue.

The next few days passed in a suffocating silence. I made lunch for Sam myself. I avoided Barbara as much as possible. She was still kind and helpful, but annoyingly kind.

Wednesday was normal. Thursday was normal too. I started to think maybe I was overreacting, maybe it really was a side effect of the medication, maybe… The problem was with me.

Then Friday came.

I had a meeting at home that afternoon. This happens occasionally; I work with some executives who prefer face-to-face discussions of sensitive topics, and sometimes it's more convenient for them to come to me than for me to go downtown. I'd set up a decent office in my converted attic space—bright, professionally set up, with a lockable door. Everything was going smoothly.

On Tuesday, I told Barbara about the meeting. I explained it very clearly. I said, ""From 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. on Friday, I have a very important meeting with a senior vice president from one of our biggest clients. The meeting is in my office upstairs. Please don't disturb me during that time. Don't knock, don't come in, just pretend I'm not home. This is really, really important for my work."" She nodded, smiled, and said she completely understood; she'd probably take a nap anyway.

The meeting started promptly at two. Vice President Margaret appeared on my screen, as serious as ever, dressed in a well-tailored suit. Margaret both intimidated and excited me; she was incredibly talented, demanding, and capable of making or breaking my career. We began reviewing quarterly forecasts, discussing drug trials, FDA approval timelines, and market strategy.

At 2:37, there was a knock at the door.

I froze, halfway through my sentence. Margaret's meticulously groomed eyebrows arched slightly.

""Excuse me,"" I said, forcing a smile, ""just a moment.""

I lowered my voice, stood up, and opened the door a crack.

Barbara stood there, holding a plate with a large, steaming apple pie topped with a small spoonful of melting vanilla ice cream.

""I made you a snack,"" she said cheerfully. ""I thought you might be hungry."" ""I’m in a meeting,"" I said urgently in a low voice. ""Didn’t I tell you not to disturb me?""

""Oh, but you’ve been here so long. You need to conserve your energy. Working without eating isn’t good for your health.""

""I’ll be there in a bit.""Eat some more. I'm dealing with something very important.""

""Just a moment. Let me bring it in for you.""

""No need. Please. Just leave it outside.""

""But the ice cream will melt.""

""It's okay. Just leave it outside.""

""Don't be silly, just a moment.""

She was already moving forward, with astonishing strength, not at all like someone who had just had a heart attack. She dragged herself into my office, carrying the plate, like she was offering a sacrifice to an angry god.

I watched in horror, as if in slow motion, as she walked into my frame, as a hint of surprise crossed Margaret's face, as Barbara turned and smiled at the screen.

""Hello,"" she said cheerfully, ""I'm bringing some pie for my daughter-in-law."" ""

Then she tripped.

I still don't know what she tripped over. The carpet was flat, there were no wires, nothing on the road. But she stumbled forward, her arms flailing wildly, and the whole plate of apple pie flew through the air in a perfect parabolic trajectory, landing squarely on me.

The pie was hot. The filling was still bubbling. It splattered all over my chest, face, hair, keyboard, notes. Apple chunks and crust slid down my shirt. Ice cream dripped onto my legs.

I sat there, covered in pie, Barbara frantically apologizing, while Margaret on the screen maintained a professionally neutral expression—an expression undoubtedly honed through years of corporate training.

""I'm so sorry,"" I said to Margaret, trying to wipe the apple filling from my chin, maintaining as much dignity as possible for someone covered in dessert. ""Something unexpected happened. Can we reschedule?""

""Of course,"" Margaret said calmly. ""Take care."" The screen went black.

I sat there, the pie still melting, Barbara futilely wiping my shoulder with a napkin.

""Honey, I’m so sorry,"" she said. ""The plate was slippery. These things happen.""

These things happen.

It happened again.

I slowly stood up, the pie sliding off me onto the floor, and walked past her without a word. I went into the bathroom, took off my soiled clothes, and stood in the shower for thirty minutes, trying not to scream.

Finally, I came out in a bathrobe and called my husband.

""Your mother has to leave,"" I said after he answered. ""Today, right now.""

""What happened?""

I told him everything: the pie, the meeting, Margaret’s expression, and the utter humiliation I had suffered.

""It was an accident,"" he said.

""In an important meeting, I specifically told her not to interrupt, but she walked into my office anyway.""

""She wanted to help."" ""She threw the pie at me.""

""She tripped. Everyone trips.""

""Your mother seems to trip quite often.""

""What do you mean?""

""It means that even though I explicitly told her not to come to my office, she still came. Just like last time with Peanut, just like she always does everything I tell her not to do.""

""You’re delusional.""

""Really? Because to me, there’s a very obvious pattern.""

""There’s no pattern at all. It’s just a series of unfortunate coincidences, all related to a woman who just had a heart attack and is taking medication that affects her balance and memory.""

""I want her to move out.""

""She has nowhere to go.""

""She has her own house.""

""The doctor said she can’t live alone right now, it’s too dangerous.""

""Then we’ll hire a home caregiver. Buy her a medical warning necklace. We’ll figure something out. But I can’t live with her anymore."" A long silence followed.

""If you force me to choose,"" he said softly, ""you definitely won't like the answer.""

A chill ran down my spine.

""Are you serious?""

""She's my mother. She almost died. She needs help. We'll help her."" ""

I hung up the phone.

I sat on the edge of the bed in my bathrobe, still smelling of cinnamon and apple, and realized I was trapped.

That evening at dinner, we ate in silence. Barbara, with a kind smile, asked how everyone's day was. My husband pretended nothing was wrong. Sam sensed the tension and kept fidgeting with the food on his plate.

I decided then and there that I wanted to get a little revenge.

My husband's boss, Linda, had been planning to come to our house for dinner for weeks. This dinner was arranged before Barbara's heart attack, before our lives completely collapsed. Linda was crucial to my husband's career; she was his mentor, his supporter, and the key figure in his two recent promotions. He spoke of her with an awe that he would never show when talking about himself.

Linda had a peculiar hobby: she raised chickens. Six drifting chickens.Bright's traditional breed chickens, kept in a quaint coop in her backyard, each with a different name，Ruth, Sonia, and Sandra. She frequently shares photos of her chickens on social media and talks about them at every company event.

The key point: Linda doesn't eat chicken. She says that since getting to know her chickens and their personalities and intelligence, she can't eat chicken; eating chicken is like eating a friend.

Everyone in my husband's office knows this. It's become an unwritten joke, something everyone brings up subtly.

We're planning a barbecue in the backyard. It'll be relaxed and friendly, and it'll give my husband a chance to network with his boss outside of work, preparing for the senior director position that will be vacant next quarter.

That Friday morning, my husband reminded me about it before he went to work.

""Linda's at six tonight,"" he said, straightening his tie in front of the mirror. ""I had my mom go to the butcher this morning. Probably steak, maybe some ribs too."" ""Sounds good,"" I replied absentmindedly. ""Go tell her yourself, and remember to tell her absolutely not to buy chicken."" I didn’t have to mention chicken; I brought it up partly for revenge and partly as an experiment.

Half an hour later, he told me, ""I made it very clear to her this morning: beef, pork, lamb, anything is fine, just absolutely no chicken. I made it very clear to her. I also explained to her about Linda’s chickens.""

""I believe she understood.""

""Hmm, she seems to have understood. She said she’ll go to the butcher shop downtown and buy some good stuff."" He kissed my cheek and went to work.

I had my own work to do，phone calls, emails, reports. Barbara said goodbye around ten o'clock and went out to run errands. I barely noticed. I was buried in a spreadsheet when my phone suddenly beeped—a new notification.

It was a family location tracking app that we'd installed after Barbara's heart attack, so we could keep track of her location in case of an emergency.

Barbara's location had been updated. I glanced at it absentmindedly. She should be downtown, probably at the butcher shop, like she said.

I continued working.

An hour later, again… A notification. I checked my phone.

Barbara's location had changed. She wasn't downtown anymore. She was driving east along the highway, out of town, completely far from our area.

I frowned. Maybe she decided to go to another butcher shop. Maybe the one downtown didn't have any good cuts of meat today.

I Googled ""nearby butcher shops"" and checked the map. In the direction she was heading, there was nothing but residential areas, and further on, some farmland.

A chill ran down my spine.

I Googled ""nearby farms.""

The nearest farm was twelve kilometers away, small and... The notice said they were selling fresh eggs, seasonal vegetables, and live poultry.

Live poultry?

No, I thought. No. This is too crazy; she won't go.

But I watched helplessly as her location stopped at that farm. I watched it remain there for twenty-seven minutes.

My hands began to tremble.

At 11:43, her location started moving towards our house.

I sat at my desk, unable to move, watching her location update every few minutes, watching her get closer and closer to home.

At 12:19, I heard a car in the driveway.

I went to the window, my heart pounding.

It was a car I didn't recognize. It was a pickup truck, with a large cargo bed. The driver got out, went around to the back, and helped Barbara out of the passenger seat.

Then he went to the back of the truck and unloaded a large wire cage.

The cage contained six chickens. Big and plump, their squawking deafening.

I stood frozen by the window, watching the driver carry the cage into the backyard, Barbara following behind, directing him where to put it. She paid in cash. He took off his hat in a gesture of greeting and drove off.

I went downstairs, feeling like I was waking from a dream. A nightmare.

I went to the backyard.

Barbara stood beside the cage, a smug look on her face, watching the chickens peck at the wire mesh.

""What?"" I asked almost in a whisper, ""What’s that?""

She turned around, flashing me a bright smile. ""Roast chicken. I wanted to buy some fresh.""

""My husband told you not to buy chicken.""

""Did he really say that?"" She tilted her head. ""I don’t think he said that.""

""He did. This morning. He specifically said you could buy beef, pork, lamb, anything, just don’t buy chicken. Because Linda doesn’t eat chicken.""

""That’s strange. I have no recollection of it.""

""Barb. These are live chickens. You drove twelve kilometers to the farm to buy live chickens.""

""Well, nothing looked good at the butcher shop, so I thought I’d look elsewhere. And these chickens are beautiful. The farmer said they’re a traditional breed, Pavlo Pintons. Linda’s pet chickens seem to be this breed too, isn’t that nice? I think she’ll like them.""

I stared at her. She stared back at me, looking innocent.

I called my husband. It went to voicemail. I remembered he’d been in meetings all afternoon.

No reply.

I sent another text: ""Your mother bought live chickens, for dinner tonight."" Three dots appeared on the screen, then disappeared. Then they reappeared.

Then my phone rang.

""What does this mean? She bought live chickens?"" he asked bluntly.

""I mean, there are six live chickens in a cage in our backyard. She drove twelve kilometers to a farm to buy them.""

Silence.

""Didn’t I tell her not to buy chicken?"" he finally spoke, his tone somewhat strange.

""I know.""

""I made myself clear.""

""I know.""

""Then why did she buy live chickens?""

""I’ve been thinking about that too.""

Another silence.

""I have to go,"" he said. ""I’ll figure something out when I get home."" He hung up the phone.

All afternoon, I was numb, listening to the clucking of the chickens in the backyard.

He arrived at 5:30, half an hour earlier than Linda expected.

I heard him walk through the front door and go straight to the backyard. Then, I heard him let out a sound somewhere between a groan and a sob.

I went outside.

He stood in front of the chicken coop, his face ashen, his hands clutching his hair.

""This can’t be,"" he said. ""This absolutely can’t be.""

""It just happened.""

""Linda will be here in half an hour.""

""I know.""

He turned sharply and strode toward the house. ""Mom!"" he called. ""Mom, can you come out for a second?""

Barbara appeared a moment later, walking cautiously, still slightly clutching her chest.

""What’s wrong, dear?""

""What are these?"" he asked, pointing to the chickens.

""The chicken for dinner.""

""Why did you buy chicken?"" ""For barbecuing.""

""I told you this morning not to buy chicken. I specifically said you could buy beef, pork, or lamb, but not chicken. I explained Linda's situation to you. I made myself clear.""

She frowned, thinking for a moment. ""You know what, I really don’t remember us saying that.""

""We did. I made it very clear at breakfast.""

""That’s strange. I remember you saying you wanted to buy some good barbecue ingredients, but I have absolutely no recollection of you saying not to buy chicken.""

""Mom."" His voice began to tremble. ""I told you. I know I told you.""

""Okay, since you say so, darling. But I really don’t remember."" ""Maybe I haven’t recovered from the effects of the medication yet.""

""So you decided to buy a live chicken?""

""The chickens at the butcher shop didn’t look very fresh, so I asked around, and someone mentioned a farm with really good chickens. I thought it should be good."" He turned to me, his eyes wide with terror. ""Did I tell her not to buy the chickens?""

""Yes,"" I said. ""I heard her. This morning at breakfast.""

He looked at Barbara again. She was looking at him too, her expression calm and unchanging.

""We have to get rid of them,"" he said. ""Can you call the farm?"" ""Have them come and pick them up?""

""I can try,"" Barbara said hesitantly, ""but I paid in cash, and I don’t know if they accept returns.""

He pulled out his phone, his hands trembling, and dialed the farm himself. I watched as he listened to the explanation that their truck was on its way and wouldn’t be back until Monday, and that they usually didn’t accept returns, and that the chickens were sold as is. His face fell.

He hung up, looking at the chickens with despair.

""We have to hide them,"" he said.

""Hide them where?"" I asked.

""I don’t know! The garage, I guess.""

""Linda will hear them; they’re squawking loudly."" ""Then we’ll put them in the car.""

""Three hours? They’ll die.""

""Okay, we’ll go put the chickens in the yard, and don’t say a word, Mom, you understand?""

At six o’clock sharp, Linda’s car pulled into the driveway.

My husband, whimpering like a wounded animal, ran to block her from seeing the chickens in the backyard.

Then, Barbara, with astonishing speed and unwavering determination, circled around to the side of the house.

""Linda!"" she called excitedly, ""Come see what we’re having for dinner!""

Caught between my anxious husband and my smiling mother-in-law, Linda chose politeness. She followed Barbara into the backyard. My husband followed behind Linda, looking like he was about to vomit.

I went outside and watched it all unfold.

Linda stopped when she saw the crate, her smile vanishing.

""What’s that?"" she asked softly. ""Chickens!"" ""Barbara proudly announced, ‘These are for roasting chicken, very fresh.’""

Linda slowly approached, as if approaching something sacred. She crouched down, examining the chickens closely.

""These are Buffalo Pington chickens,"" she said, ""a traditional breed. Just like the chickens I raise.""

""That’s right!"" Barbara beamed. ""The farmer said they’re the same. I think you’ll appreciate their quality.""

""Are these for dinner?""

""Yes, for dinner.""

Linda slowly stood up, her expression completely frozen.

""You invited me to dinner,"" she said to my husband, ""knowing I don’t eat chicken, knowing I only keep chickens as pets, yet you bought the exact same breed as my chickens to slaughter and cook?""

""No,"" my husband said desperately, ""no, there must be a misunderstanding. I told My mother said anything but chickens. I made myself clear.""

Linda looked at Barbara. ""Really? Did he really tell you not to buy chickens?""

Barbara smiled kindly. ""I’m afraid I don’t remember. Maybe my memory isn’t what it used to be.""

""So you decided to buy live chickens yourself?""

""I thought it was fine. Fresh.""

Linda looked at the chickens again, then at Barbara, and finally at my husband. Her expression changed, becoming cold and resolute.

""I’m taking these chickens with me,"" she said. ""I have room in my coop; they deserve better.""

""Please,"" my husband began, but she raised a hand to stop him.

""We’ll talk about it at work on Monday,"" she said flatly. ""I think I’d better leave now."" She loaded the chickens one by one into the car, and we all stood there in silence. She drove off, taking the chickens with her, and my husband turned to his mother and asked.

""Why?"" he choked out. ""Why did you do this?""

""I didn’t do anything wrong, honey. I bought dinner.""

""I told you not to buy chicken.""

""I don’t remember.""

""Mom,"" he almost cried, ""I told you, you know I told you.""

She gently patted his arm. ""You’re under a lot of pressure, baby. Maybe you’re mistaken.""

He looked at me, his face full of pain. ""I told her. Didn’t I? I’m not crazy.""

""You told her,"" I said, ""very clearly，At breakfast.We went inside. The house felt different; a dark and unsettling atmosphere permeated it.

My husband was trembling. I saw him pour himself a glass of water, put it down, but not drink it; his hands were shaking.

Barbara followed us in, still cheerful, still amiable, as if nothing had happened, and went straight to her usual chair in the living room.

My husband and I stood in the kitchen, staring at each other.

We stood there in silence for a moment, then he seemed to have made up his mind. He went into the living room, where Barbara was sitting reading a magazine.

""Mom,""he said, his voice tense, ""why did you buy chicken?""

She looked up and blinked. ""Honey,yes for a barbecue.""

""I told you not to buy chicken.""

""Did you? I really don’t remember.""

""No."" His voice rose. ""No, that’s not how it is. I told you very clearly not to buy chicken. And you went and bought as many chickens as possible."" ""A live chicken. The same breed as Linda's pet.""

""What a coincidence.""

""Stop talking."" He almost yelled. ""Stop pretending. Stop lying. Tell me the truth. Did you do it on purpose?""

She put down her magazine, looking hurt. ""I would never intentionally hurt you.""

""Then what's wrong with you? Is it a side effect of the medication? Or brain damage from a heart attack? Because something serious must be wrong with you.""

""I don't think you can talk to your mother like that.""

I stood in the doorway, watching Barbara's expression change. Not guilt, not shame, but something else. Something I couldn't quite put my finger on.

""You're angry,"" she said calmly. ""Your mind is a mess.""

""My mind is clear. For the first time in weeks, I see you clearly.""

""What do you mean by that?"" He stared at her, and I could tell he was struggling to find the right words to describe what he was seeing.

""I think,""he said slowly, ""you do it every time someone tells you not to do something."" I don’t know if it’s conscious or unconscious, the effect of drugs or something else, but there’s definitely a pattern. A very obvious pattern.""

Barbara tilted her head, thinking. ""That’s a strange thought.""

""Really? Because the evidence is very conclusive.""

""So you mean? I’m some kind of reverse psychology monster? Deliberately doing the opposite?""

""I don’t know what kind of person you are. But I know something’s definitely wrong.""

She slowly stood up and picked up a magazine. ""I think I should go rest. This conversation is really bothering me.""

""Don't!""

""I’m tired. I had a heart attack, you remember? I need to rest.""

She headed for the stairs, and I think something snapped in my husband’s heart.

""Do you want to know what I think?"" he shouted at her retreating back. ""I think even if I told you not to do the truly insane things, the things no normal person would ever do, you'd still do them. I think even if I told you right now not to hunt down all the dangerous criminals in this country, not to track down all the fugitives, murderers, and pedophiles, you'd rush out the door to find them.""

Barbara stopped on the stairs.

The room fell silent.

She slowly turned around, looking at him with her bright eyes.

""What did you just say?"" she asked softly.

""I said—"" he gasped, his face flushed, the words escaping his lips in anger and despair, ""I think even if someone told you not to do it, you'd do it. I think if I said, ‘Mom, please don't hunt down all the drug dealers, hardened criminals, and pedophiles on the run in America,’ you'd probably do it too.""

For a moment, nothing happened.

Barbara stood motionless on the stairs, her hand gripping the railing.

Then her expression changed. Her eyes sharpened, and she straightened up. She suddenly looked younger and stronger, more alert than I'd seen her at any time since she arrived.

""No,"" she said, her tone hardening, ""tell me what I can't do.""

Then she moved.

I don't know how to describe it. One second she was on the stairs, like an old woman with a heart condition. The next she was at the front door, incredibly fast, a blurry figure.

""Mom?"" my husband called out, puzzled. ""Mom, wait!""

But she was already outside. I ran to the window and saw her standing in the driveway, moving with incredible speed. It was practically a law of physics; it hurt my eyes. She wasn't running; she was moving back and forth between two points, seemingly without even crossing the gap.

""What—"" I began, but my husband rushed to the door. ""Mom! Stop! I didn’t mean it!""

We both ran out, but she was already at the end of the driveway, and faster, incredibly fast.

""Mom!"" he shouted, ""Come back! I just said something stupid! I didn’t mean it!""

She turned around, and for a fleeting moment, I saw her face. She was smiling. Not the kind of gentle grandmotherly smile. Something else. An urgent, sharp, inhuman smile.

Then she vanished.

Just like that. She moved so fast, as if she had disappeared from existence in an instant, leaving only a faint trace where she had just stood.

My husband and I stood in the driveway, staring at the empty street.

""What just happened?""I asked in a low voice.

He didn't answer. He had already run to his car, frantically fumbling for his keys. I followed and jumped into the passenger seat.

He slammed on the start and sped off in the direction she had disappeared.

We drove for five minutes, ten minutes, scanning every street, every sidewalk. Nothing. No trace of her.

""Where could she have go?"" I asked.

""I don’t know. The police station? The FBI headquarters? How am I supposed to know where to catch a criminal?""

He pulled over, grabbed his phone, and opened the family location app.

Barbara’s location appeared on the screen.

It was moving. Faster. Faster than any car, certainly faster than any sixty-three-year-old woman should be.

We stared in disbelief as her location jumped across the city, traversing blocks in seconds, its movement almost methodical. As if she were searching for something.

""This can’t be,""my husband said.

""What is she doing? ""

Her location suddenly stopped, stopping in an area known for drugs, prostitution, and crime.

Then it started moving again, faster, jumping from one location to another.

We couldn't catch her at all. We tried chasing her in cars, but she was too fast. Her cell phone tracking showed she was traversing the entire city, jumping from one crime scene to another.

The latest tracking information shows she has left the state.

So now I'm sitting here, writing divorce papers and asking if anyone has seen an elderly woman about 1.6 meters tall, with a gray bob haircut, wearing a chain and reading glasses, who moves incredibly fast and apprehends wanted criminals, please contact me",6,1770641494.0,nosleep,1,0.75,False

Now I've always seen my business eventually go into a cafe concept where by we can run the cafe as an ongoing business under my main Ltd company and utilise the kitchen and storage within said café for the private dining and catering side of things​ ​aswell, with the cafe operating under the catering business. ​

  
Now, here comes the rant part, we've found the absolute perfect premises, big enough to operate a decent sized cafe and build on that, a fairly new building that's in dependant of itself, plenty of parking as this was a big one for us. We've viewed and been in discussions over the last two years​ with 3 other people about other venues, but ended up just being messed around with the financial side of stuff when it came to numbers and pricing. 

This venue, prior to viewing I even showed on paper all my branding, a business plan of where I saw any concept going, how we would push and build the business but the bloke didn't really seem arsed.... Think a guy in his late 60s, a farmer with lots of land. Now bearing in mind this place is sat empty right now and we can get in there sharpish, start paying rent and even offered 3 months rent up front, my problem is that he's so blasé baout it like he's not even bothered, yet was bothered enough to meet us and how us around. He didn't seem arsed about my experience in the industry and how keen I am to make any business succeed, he didn't even seem bothered by the fact I was willing to invest money into the business on things like ​ new flooring, a new coffee machine and brining all my own kitchen equipment..... An issue he said he'd had with precious tenants who had only been there 5 months, weren't paying rent on time , were opening and closing when they felt like it and invested nothing to try to make it work. 

It's so frustrating as we have everything ready to go but a venue. A call this morning asking him had he had a chnace to think about things and his actual response was ""it's all up in the air"" and hadn't really had thoughts on it just yet.

The lights fluctuated.

It was only a blink, a stutter, but it was visible to all. It was felt by all. For a brief moment, the shadows in the corners appeared deeper than they should have been, and the faint hum of the fluorescents changed pitch.

Then everything returned to normal as the lights stabilised.

Slowly, the door closed.

I could see nothing through the glass. Nothing but darkness. Not a field, not a parking lot, not a corridor. It's completely black, as though the world has been painted over.

Kaylee? Diana gave a call. She just raised her voice above a whisper.

No response.

A shape stirred in the dark behind the door. It shifted slowly, as if a great weight pressed forward. Glass separated it, yet movement showed - something large on the other side.

With a quick motion, I locked the door.

My hands started to tremble.

""Nobody else goes outside,"" I said. ""Nobody.""

No one argued.

Time showed three seventeen in the morning.

Three seventeen, unchanged through the hours. Time sat still, marked only by that number refusing to shift.

After a while I just gave up counting. Maybe it was sixty minutes, maybe not - no clock around, no phone signal, nothing from beyond these walls, so time turned loose and wobbly. It could have been minutes, it could have been days. Could be longer. Hard to tell when everything feels stretched.

Gerald stayed put, eyes fixed on the wood grain, words slipping out now and then under his breath. Not far off, Diana moved between others, quiet but steady - seeing who needed what, staying near those trembling, holding back tears herself while shielding them from worse fear. Resting by a glass window, Ruth hung limp, maybe dreaming, maybe not, chin dipped toward her chest. Beside her, the child curled close, small hand gripping fur, gaze locked on the rise and fall of her coat, as if she was making sure she didn’t stop.

Back by the counter is where I stood. It felt safer, somehow, being there. Separated from what unfolded - by nothing much, really, just floor space and a cash register which didn’t work.

""The fryer's off,"" Dave said.

Up I glanced. There he stood near the kitchen entrance, a frown on his face.

""What?""

""The fryer. I can still smell it, but it's not on. Nothing back there is on. No heat, no power, nothing.""

""The lights are still working.""

""Yeah."" He looked up at the fluorescents. ""But nothing else. I checked the walk-in freezer too. Door's stuck. Won't budge.""

""What about the back exit?""

""Same. Won't open."" He walked back toward the lobby, his boots heavy on the tile. ""It's like the whole place is sealed up. Like it's... holding us.""

That thought sat heavy, though. As if this Wendy’s wasn’t just a building - like it was watchful, almost patient, like it had plans we weren’t meant to understand. Staying there seemed less accidental each minute.

Yet my mind kept circling back to Kaylee.

Into the dark she went when the door closed behind her. Waiting followed, then voices shouting her name filled the air. Our noses touched cold glass, straining to catch a shape, a shadow, any sign. Blackness stayed - thick, unbroken. Not even a flicker showed itself. Time passed like that. Calling faded first. Looking slipped away next. Silence grew between us, heavy with what we knew but never said: she wasn’t coming back.

Gone where?

It came as a surprise. Wanting to understand never crossed my mind.

Out of nowhere, Mia whispered, ""Does anybody else see it?"" Slumped across from Jason in the booth, their faces drained, the argument between them dissolving like smoke when faced with what just showed up. ""The menu.""

""What about it?""

""Look at it.""

Up above, the menu caught my eye. There it was again, Wendy's usual spread - burgers first, then chicken, fries always near the bottom, Frostys waiting at the end like they do every time. Photos showing meals too perfect to match what actually lands on your tray. Prices, combos, limited-time offers.

Except.

The words were wrong.

It wasn’t something that jumped out at first glance - only if you slowed down, really looked past the usual shapes. Yet the moment it caught your eye, everything shifted. From then on, there was no looking back at it in the same way.

BACONATOR turned into BACONEATER.

DAVE'S SINGLE was now DAVE'S SIGNAL.

The image of what looked just like a Frosty - same cup, same creamy twist inside - but the name below said FROSTBITE instead. A chill ran through the air when eyes landed on that sign.

""That's not right,"" I said. ""That's not - ""

""It wasn't like that before,"" Mia said. ""I looked at it when I first got here. It was normal. It changed.""

""Things don't just change.""

Change is everywhere. Her hand swept across the room. See it

I looked.

The same booths. Tables just like always. Floor, walls, windows - identical. Yet something felt off. Not obvious, but there, a quiet imbalance. Higher than remembered, the ceiling loomed. A step toward the doorway stretched further. Shadows deepened at each edge of the space, although nothing had changed with the lighting.

Outside the glass - where Ruth rested her head - the view had gone. Not a trace of the parking lot remained. The field vanished. The hall disappeared. Even night pulled away. What stayed was empty. Colourless. Like static on an unplugged TV.

""This is not a real place,"" Diana said. Listening she had been from far off in the room, arms holding tight around her own body. ""Is it? This Wendy's. It's not real.""

""It feels real,"" Dave said.

""So do dreams.""

""This isn't a dream.""

""Then what is it?""

Nobody answered.

That idea stuck with me - thresholds. The gap where sleep fades into being awake, that blink when your mind floats between worlds, when what's real starts to fray at the edges and oddness sneaks in. Each one of us had known it. Every single person. Somehow every path led here - inside walls pretending to be a Wendy’s, air thick with the smell of burgers, yet nothing fitting just so.

A fold in reality. A glitch in the system. A place that shouldn't exist, filled with people who shouldn't be here.

""Someone will come,"" Ruth whispered. Awake now - or perhaps she hadn’t drifted off at all - her tone carried a quiet sureness unique to those who’ve seen decades pass. ""Someone always shows up,"" she believed. ""Patience is all it takes.""

""Who's going to come?"" Jason asked. ""No one knows we're here. No one's looking for us.""

""When people go missing, they look for them.""

""We didn't go missing. We went - somewhere else."" He ran his hands through his hair. ""My body's probably still in that waiting room. Mia's is probably still in the dentist's chair. We didn't disappear. We just... left. And no one's going to find us because there's nothing to find.""

""That  isn’t right,"" Ruth replied, though her words carried less sureness than before.

""Isn't it?"" Jason stood up, agitated, pacing the same way the business woman had been pacing earlier. ""Think about it. We all fell asleep, or passed out, or went under. We're not here. Not really. We're in a coma somewhere, or dead, or -""

Firmness filled Diana's voice. ""Not dead yet"" she stated.

""How do you know?""

""Because I'm a nurse, and this doesn't feel like dying.""

""How would you know what dying feels like?""

""I've watched enough people do it.""

Quiet took hold after that. He stopped talking.

Leaning on the counter, I let my thoughts drift. Over in the corner, the man in the hospital gown held my attention - his eyes fixed ahead, unblinking, yet his mouth formed quiet words. Though silent to me, they slipped out like secrets meant for someone else.
