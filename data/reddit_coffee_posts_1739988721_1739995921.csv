1itf8di,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1itf8di/baby_coffee/,Baby coffee‚Ä¶,"So my sister comes over today to help out with stuff around the house. She has no baby experience so she kindly did some laundry, chores yadda yadda.

One thing she did was make me a cup of coffee. I appreciated it so much because I didn‚Äôt ask for it. When I tell you it was the TASTIEST damn cup of coffee I‚Äôve ever laid lips upon. I dunno if it was cos it was made for me for once but DAMN it was smooth but strong, silky in the mouth-feel, a little sweet without being syrupy. It just hit my caffeine g-spot right in the bullseye.

Anyway, I was raving so much about this cup coffee that my sister eventually guiltily admitted that ‚Ä¶ because we had no fresh milk in the fridge or creamer she added‚Ä¶ a scoop of baby formula‚Ä¶

So now I have to decide if I resign myself to a life of never TRULY tasting coffee again or if I‚Äôm a person who drinks their coffee with baby formula from now on. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

1itf78v,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1itf78v/parents_oblivious_to_their_role/,Parents oblivious to their role,"My parents have never maliciously made me feel unimportant and like I‚Äôm a burden. I know that they didn‚Äôt realize the lifelong implications of telling an 8 year old to ‚Äúcut them some slack‚Äù when in my eight-year-old way of expressing that I needed them I told my mom that she‚Äôs a bad mom because she‚Äôs not involved in our life. I got told I was tattling when I tried to tell them my sister would say things like she wants me to die and hoped somebody kills Mr in my sleep. I got the classic ‚Äútalk to the palm‚Äù with an annoyed expression. I understand that my dad is equally if not more culpable because he willfully chose to ignore problems and be emotionally absent, choosing everybody that wanted him to do something over his family. My mom has always had depression and anxiety so I understand why she slept away my childhood. What pisses me off is that no matter what I say to her, she has nothing to say. She has this Rolodex of standard surface level phrases she will say back but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had a conversation of substance or real meaning with my mom ever. If I tell her about something that‚Äôs bothering me, she just comes up with reasons as to why it shouldn‚Äôt bother me or why I should feel sympathy towards the person bothering me because they‚Äôre probably not doing it on purpose even if they blatantly are. For fucks sake can you just have my back for once?! I had this epiphany a few years ago whenever I had a conversation with them about plans for the future or idea their response is a reluctant ‚Äúokay‚Äù most of the time or tell me everything that could go wrong with no suggestions for an alternative or to problem solve. They really don‚Äôt understand the impact this is had on me. As an adult, I ruminate on things that bother me and it consumes me because I feel like I‚Äôm in the wrong when I‚Äôm overreacting so it just festers inside of me and I feel like a bad person. I feel so many negative emotions when I feel like expressing a need or if somebody did something to hurt me. It causes me so much distress that it sends me into depressions for days and makes me sick to my stomach. I feel like I don‚Äôt have a right to feel that way, as if it‚Äôs my fault for needing something. I was telling her about a situation in my apartment about a guy who, for the entire three years that I‚Äôve lived there, sits in front of the building all day smoking cigarettes and weed, which is fine. The issue is his scream coughing and gagging for accumulative several hours a day. I smoke weed so I know it‚Äôs the classic weed cough with the signature gag at the end. It‚Äôs not from having some respiratory illness. It is the loudest coughing you could ever hear every single hit. You can literally hear him a block away. It‚Äôs objectively obnoxious, and I refuse to back down from that standpoint. I told my mom that I was gonna get him some edibles that might help the situation and she was so staunchly opposed to this because ‚Äú he wouldn‚Äôt know where it came from and it might interact with medication he‚Äôs on‚Äù Assuming he‚Äôs even on medication?!?!?! He smokes weed all day every day and his coughing is hard enough to give himself a heart attack. Edibles come in sealed packages with all the ingredients and potency on them and regulated by the state. I didn‚Äôt end up doing it and complained to the building manager and sent her like six videos, documenting his gagging and wretching instead. Listening to it has dramatically lowered my quality of life because I get a pang of anxiety in my stomach and my chest when I hear it because I don‚Äôt know how long it‚Äôs gonna last and I don‚Äôt know when it will end. He starts between 7-8 AM so I can‚Äôt even enjoy my coffee on my balcony in my expensive apartment. It‚Äôs very hard to drown out because it‚Äôs so loud. My building manager obviously thought it was valid because she said she would talk to him. I told my mom and she said that the coughing probably bothers him too, but addictions are hard to quit. There‚Äôs no winning with her. It‚Äôs always all the reasons why I‚Äôm wrong about the way I feel. She thinks that she is giving me a nice to change my mind and just not be bothered by things. In reality, she‚Äôs invalidating me and giving absolutely no support or suggesting anything to help the situation. Long story, I know, but I was enraged after this conversation. I‚Äôm so over feeling like it‚Äôs my fault for having negative feelings. I tried to include her in my daily life and I know she wants to be included, but it‚Äôs like pulling teeth with her.

Took a walk around Hampstead and realized I had been missing out on SOOO many parts in London. When searching, it was option overload.

So I made a solution!¬†[https://london-day-planner-flareondon.replit.app/](https://london-day-planner-flareondon.replit.app/)

This tool allows you to give a few details about your day -- then gives you an itinerary of perfect places to go around London -- you can then download it with adresses and times straight to your phone or laptop.

Testing just in London, but looking to turn this into a tool for digital nomads all around the globe. I know I often spend over half an hour looking for the perfect coffee shop or workspace in the perfect area.

1itf4fx,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1itf4fx/i_54m_dont_know_if_i_should_reconcile_with_my/,I (54m)  don't know if I should reconcile with my ex-wife (55f) after two aborted attempts,"TL;DR: My ex-wife left me in 2008. We have tried to reconcile twice, and she sabotaged the effort each time. She got remarried, and her husband died. She has asked me to reconcile again. I am not convinced that she has changed. I would need her to apologize for her previous actions, own up to her behavior, and demonstrate that she can be trusted, but I don't know how. What can I have her do beyond us going to couple's therapy to see if we could make things work? Is it crazy to consider reconciling at all?  
  
I met my wife in the military in 1991. We dated for two years and got married in 1993. We had three wonderful, happy years together, traveling and just having a blast being best friends. When I got out of the military in 1996, we moved to a big city in her home state. She went back to the Catholic Church, and we started having kids. I finished my degree, got a job downtown, and bought a lovely house in the suburbs. We were deeply in love and had a wonderful life.  
  
In 2008, now with five children, I got sick and ended up getting rushed to the hospital. I was admitted to the ICU, and they told my wife I had less than a 20% chance of surviving and recovering. I ended up being in the ICU for just over four months before I finally recovered. I spent two additional weeks in the ""regular hospital"" after being released from the ICU and came home to start a long recovery of physical and occupational therapy. The doctors told us that I would likely have additional ""flare-ups"" of the auto-immune disease that caused my hospitalization.

My wife told me that this was all too much, she couldn't raise five kids alone, and she wanted to move three hours away to a small rural town by her family. I told her this didn't make sense, I needed to be close to the hospital in the big city where we lived, and it would be even more disruption for the kids. Two weeks later, I came home from an overnight stay in the hospital for a procedure to find the house empty. She had used our savings to do a lease-purchase on a house by her parents and moved herself and the kids there. 

I decided that I would sell the house, stop trying to go back to work, and move to be with her and the kids. While I was in our house getting it ready to sell, she had an affair. She told me about it the next day. She said she ran into her boyfriend from high school, the went out for coffee to catch-up, and it just happened. I was devastated and filed for divorce.   
  
We officially separated. I staying in the old house and she lived in the new lease-purchase 3 hours away. I would drive up Friday night, spend the night, pickup the kids early Saturday, drive them back home late morning, and then have to drive them home Sunday night. 

Three months into separation, I met a woman at physical therapy. We dated for nine weeks before she asked if she could move in. When I wouldn't let her move in, we broke up. 

After eight months of separation, my wife asked me if we could reconcile. I had returned to work but it wasn't working out. I was going back onto STD with the intention that I would probably go on LTD. Since I wasn't going to be able to work anyway and my medical situation was stable, I considered selling the house and making the three-hour move. 

I started visiting the kids at her house and that led to her and I going out for dinner. She invited me to move in with her. I told her I would but that she needed to know that I had slept with someone while we were separated. She became angry, said I had betrayed her, and withdrew the offer to move in. Instead, she had me served with divorce papers. I sold the house as part of the divorce and downsized to a smaller house about 40 minutes closer to her. 

Fast forward 11 years. I have been on disability this entire time and have been in and out of the hospital and the ICU over the years. I have dated four women in those 11 years but never got to the ""live together"" phase. She got remarried, and it was a tumultuous relationship. The two of the middle children came to live with me. Her Dad died of cancer, and her Mom had just died of COVID. She and her husband separated when she caught him cheating, and she responded by cheating back on him.   
  
With her and her husband discussing divorce, she approached me about considering moving in together platonically. We had a date picked out, and her house packed up. As the weeks went on, we progressed from her moving in as a roommate to her asking if I would consider going to couples counseling to discuss a possible reconciliation. I was thrilled that we could be back together. The night before the move, she told me that our oldest was refusing to move into the dorms and wanted to stay in the house, so she and my oldest would be staying in her home, but the other four kids would move in with me.   


She and her husband ended up working things out. He moved back in a few months later. A year and a half ago, my youngest asked to move back in with her Mom, so we got her moved back 3 hours away so she could start high school there.   
  
Fast forward to last month when her husband was injured in a freak worksite accident -- he suffered a head injury on the job and died in the hospital the next day. Now, four weeks after his funeral, she called me last night. She said she is considering returning to the city when our daughter graduates next year. She said she isn't ready to date yet but that when she is prepared, she would like to go out on a date with me and see if we think we could make things work like they did before we had kids. 

I told her that while those were the happiest years of my life, I didn't know if we could be that way together again. She had crushed me when we didn't reconcile the last two times, and she never apologized for cheating on me in the first place. I don't want to get hurt again, and I don't know if I can trust her. I would love for us to work things out and ""have a happy ending together,"" but I don't know how to get from where we are to ""happily ever after."" 

I don't know what to do from here. I am willing to give her a chance, but at the same time, I am highly skeptical that she will keep her word and reconcile. She knows I never stopped loving her, and she may feel that she has no other good options besides getting back with me or living alone. I told her that we would need to go to couples therapy before I would go out with her on a date or move in together, even as roommates. She is saying that she would be willing to go to couples counseling, but she needs more time to grieve first. 

Which do I listen to - my heart or my gut? If I do decide to give her a chance, how do I go about it?",1,1739995527.0,relationship_advice,3,0.67,False

Not really asking a question, more posting as a discussion. I feel like its going to be impossible to find a project right now during the chaos (whether its good or bad).

My Coach messaged me stating that he's nervous for all GPS people on the bench right now (great!). I've applied to so many ProFinda postings and haven't heard anything back. Dozens of coffee chats with leaders and networking events. It's rough out there.

I came across the Gina pour over and Flair Neo Flex on FB marketplace for $100 us. I then bought a k6 and kettle to round out the combo and have been loving the various workflows and the coffee/espresso they produce. Eventually I‚Äôll upgrade the flair to a pro/58 but so far, other than build quality, the Neo Flex is a solid little machine.

1itf17m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1itf17m/my_daughter_considers_herself_an_equal/,My daughter considers herself an equal,"My husband and I have 2 kids. The younger one is 16. She has a lot of varying diagnosis and doesn't leave the house, unless she is with me to go to community groups. I've always tried hard to make sure that everyone at home feels that it is their home- not just mum and dad's home. I don't like the whole idea of making kids feel as though they are visitors in their own home. So we have our shared spaces. Everything is a shared space except our bedrooms. 

I've gone too far. My daughter can be quite rude with her opinions- as an example- decorating. She'll say something looks trashy and demand that I don't buy it anymore eg coasters that are AI generated. I'll tell her I'm sorry you don't like it, I do and she shouldn't tell me what I can or can't buy/like. She'll retort that it's a shared space so she gets a say.
She'll also insist that my husband or I don't buy something- to the point where she gets really angry if we don't agree. Eg too much coffee etc. I'll explain its our money and we can spend it how we want. As long as her needs are taken care of and we provide everything she needs then how we spend is not up to her. She says it's the family money and she should have a say. It's not the family money, it's our hard earned wages. It's frustrating.
I wanted to raise her as an active member  of the family. But instead she now sees her role not as a child but as an equal. An equal who can dictate to her parents how money is spent, how the house should be decorated etc. 

How do I highlight the difference between it being our house/our finances and not the families finances etc",4,1739995309.0,Parenting,1,1.0,False
1itf16j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1itf16j,"I asked chatgpt to describe with a lot of detail a photo of me, and then preceeded to generate an image out of the detailed description","*Description chatgpt gave me:*


Facial Features & Expression:

The person has fair skin with a smooth texture, a few barely noticeable blemishes or uneven tones, giving a natural and youthful appearance.

Their forehead is partially covered by their wavy hair, but the visible skin appears unmarked and of an even tone.

Their eyebrows are dark brown, naturally shaped with a slight arch, and neither overly thick nor too thin. A few stray hairs are visible, indicating a natural, untrimmed look.

Their deep-set eyes have a sharp focus directed at the camera. The irises are a shade of brown, though the exact tone is slightly obscured by the reflection in their glasses. Their eyelashes are of average length, naturally curved, and dark.

They wear black-framed glasses with a slightly curved rectangular design. The lenses reflect some light, causing a subtle glare in the upper portion. The arms of the glasses disappear behind their thick hair, and the nose pads rest gently on their slightly upturned nose.

Their nose is well-proportioned, with a narrow bridge that widens slightly at the nostrils. The tip has a soft, rounded shape. The skin on the nose is smooth, with a natural shine from the lighting.

Their lips are a natural pinkish hue, closed in a neutral expression. The upper lip is slightly thinner than the lower lip, which has a subtle pout due to its fullness. The corners of the mouth are relaxed, giving an overall calm, composed look.

Their jawline is soft and rounded, leading to a slightly pointed chin that complements their oval face shape. The cheeks are slightly full, adding to a youthful appearance.

Their overall expression conveys quiet confidence, introspection, or mild curiosity as they look directly into the camera lens.



---

Hair:

Their hair is a rich, medium-to-dark brown with hints of natural highlights that catch the light.

It is voluminous, thick, and slightly unkempt, suggesting either natural waves or a lack of recent styling.

The hair on top has more lift, creating a soft, tousled effect.

The sides are slightly shorter, framing the face and curling outward at the ends.

The back appears to reach just past the nape of the neck, blending into the layers on the sides.

The hair texture is soft with a slightly frizzy quality, especially around the edges where stray hairs are visible.

There is no visible parting; instead, the hair naturally falls across the forehead and to the sides.



---

Clothing:

The hoodie is a bold, bright red with a zip-up front.

The material is thick and plush, likely fleece or a cotton-polyester blend, designed for warmth and comfort.

The zipper is fully closed, reaching the base of their neck, and has a small metal pull-tab.

The sleeves are slightly oversized, extending just beyond the wrists. The cuffs are ribbed and snug around the wrists.

The fabric has tiny white specks, possibly lint or dust, giving a slightly worn-in look.

There are faint creases on the shoulders and sleeves, suggesting the hoodie has been worn for a while.

The seams are well-stitched, with no loose threads visible.



---

Posture & Pose:

They are holding the camera at a high angle, extending one arm outward and slightly above eye level.

Their head is tilted slightly forward, creating a perspective that makes the face appear more prominent in the frame.

Their shoulders are relaxed but slightly raised due to the angle of the arm taking the photo.

Their body is partially turned to the side, with only the upper torso visible.

Their neck is partially obscured by the hoodie, but the natural curve is still visible.

Background & Environment:

Desk & Study Area:

A white study desk is positioned against the wall, cluttered with various objects.

An open notebook with red and blue margins lies near the edge, containing handwritten notes in black or blue ink.

A blue scientific calculator rests atop the notebook, partially covering a page.

A green and yellow folder sits nearby, slightly overlapping the notebook.

A plastic water bottle with a blue cap is near the corner of the desk, partially filled.

A white ceramic cup or mug, possibly for coffee or tea, is beside the bottle, though the contents are not visible.

Small stationery items such as pens, pencils, and an eraser are scattered across the desk.

A power strip with multiple cords plugged in is on the floor beneath the desk, with some cords extending toward the desktop.


Shelving Unit Above Desk:

White shelves are mounted on the wall, neatly organized with books, files, and small storage boxes.

A brown wooden box with intricate carvings is placed on one shelf, possibly used for storing jewelry or keepsakes.

A stack of colorful books and binders stands upright, supported by bookends.

A green plastic organizer with compartments holds various stationery supplies.


Room & Lighting:

The walls are painted a soft lavender or pastel lilac shade, creating a calming atmosphere.

A window with closed white blinds is visible to the left, partially covered by a sheer white curtain that is slightly pulled to the side.

Artificial lighting casts a warm, yellowish glow, likely from a ceiling light or desk lamp.

The floor is wooden with a honey-toned finish.

A purple-cushioned office chair with a black frame is tucked under the desk, with its wheels slightly visible.

A black chair with a simple design is partially obscured behind the person.



---

Overall Mood & Atmosphere:

The setting feels personal, cozy, and well-used, suggesting a space frequently occupied for studying or working.

The person's direct gaze and slightly tousled appearance convey a sense of casual confidence.

The color palette is warm and inviting, with the red hoodie providing a strong contrast against the softer lavender walls and neutral furniture tones.

The lighting and angle add depth to the image, emphasizing the facial features and surroundings with a natural, candid feel.

I smoke a lot and have usually have sugary chewing gums, maybe one or two in a day, and two to three cups of tea or coffee in a day, with sugar. My gums used to bleed before but that problem is slowly going away but I really need help with my foul breath. I feel anxious to talk in front of people. What should I do?

1itevxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1itevxr/problems_never_go_away/,Problems never go away.,"If you're finding great success with SR it's important to not forget where you started from. Just now I was getting down in spirits, all these problems in my life, but then I remembered the state I was in 4 months ago. Truly a shadow of what I am now, then I literally just couldn't get off my phone scrolling bullshit, lying in bed, cumming in socks, and all round just rotting. Now what I'm struggling with is to work consistently on my goals, to remember God and virtue, to take more care of my health. In a sense problems never go away, or rather it's that The Problem never goes away. The fact that life has challenges in it for you to meet. But as you elevate and conquer life you not only move along by tackling all these little problems, like ticking them off on a to do list, but you also start to change your stance to problems in general.

Paraphrasing Marcus Aurelius - Everything in nature moves in cycles, always repeating itself, but the path of virtue follows a stranger and more mysterious path.

Virtue, godliness, love. They don't have their origin from this world, they're from God. This is the path out of the labyrinth of pleasure and pain. As you wind through life remember to look up, grow your wings, realize the higher calling, and fly out of the maze.  Eventually.

So find a touchstone, something to remind you of the highest possible calling, a North Star, something to steer by through every storm. The skeleton key.

Saint Anselm of Canterbury defined God simply as ""being than which no greater can be conceived"". Whatever this is for you, it's your conception of God.

This might all seem like too much for you, the language of heaven is beautiful but daunting. Do we even want to be there ? in the vast perfection of God. Looking down you might miss the little things of life that seem out of place in heaven, a cheesy comedy, a cup of coffee, beers with friends, girls in bikinis'. But here's the secret to religion which they don't tell you, by forcing you to try to achieve the impossible, only then will you achieve what's possible. You will not become God, but a god.

Too high for earth, too low for heaven, I built my castle in the clouds.

Good luck out there my cum absorbing brothers, lets make the world a better place and have some fun while we're at it.",6,1739994966.0,Semenretention,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve also noticed more industrial and commercial units popping up in the area between the highway and Woodbine, including a Tesla service center.

Additionally, is there an interactive map where we can check zoning information or business permits for these industrial areas?

Embarking on a weight loss journey can feel overwhelming, with so much information available it's hard to know where to start. The good news is that effective and sustainable strategies exist! Diet and exercise remain cornerstones of successful weight management, backed by decades of research. This updated blog post addresses your most frequently asked questions, providing evidence-based answers to guide you on your path to a healthier weight.

**What are the best diets for weight loss?**

The concept of a single ""best"" diet for weight loss is outdated. Current research emphasizes¬†**sustainable dietary patterns**¬†over restrictive, fad diets. Instead of focusing on rapid, unsustainable weight loss, aim for gradual, healthy changes you can maintain long-term.

Here‚Äôs what the evidence shows:

* **Focus on Dietary Patterns:**¬†The Mediterranean diet, DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, and plant-based diets consistently rank among the healthiest and most effective for weight management and overall health. These patterns emphasize whole, unprocessed foods.
* **Macronutrient Balance:**¬†While low-carbohydrate diets like keto and paleo can lead to initial rapid weight loss, studies show that in the long term (1-2 years), the¬†*macronutrient ratio*¬†(carbs, protein, fat) is less critical than overall calorie intake and diet quality. Sustainable weight loss hinges on creating a calorie deficit you can maintain.
* **Protein is Key for Satiety and Muscle:**¬†Adequate protein intake is crucial for weight loss. Protein helps you feel fuller for longer, preserving lean muscle mass during calorie restriction. Aim for approximately¬†**1.2 to 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight for active individuals**.
* **Fiber-Rich Foods are Your Allies:**¬†Foods high in fiber, like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, contribute to satiety, regulate blood sugar, and support gut health.¬†**Studies consistently link higher fiber intake with improved weight management.**
* **Limit Processed Foods, Sugary Drinks, and Added Sugars:**¬†These contribute empty calories, promote cravings, and hinder weight loss efforts.

**Instead of a ""best diet,"" find a healthy eating pattern you enjoy and can stick to. Personalization is crucial! Consulting a registered dietitian can help you create a plan tailored to your individual needs and preferences.**

**What type of exercise should I do for weight loss?**

The most effective exercise for weight loss is one you¬†**enjoy and will do consistently.**¬†A combination of different types of exercise is generally recommended for optimal health and weight management.

* **Cardiovascular Exercise (Cardio):**¬†Activities that elevate your heart rate, like brisk walking, running, cycling, swimming, or dancing, are excellent for burning calories and improving cardiovascular health. Aim for at least¬†**150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week**.
* **Strength Training (Resistance Training):**¬†Building muscle mass is crucial for boosting your metabolism. Muscle tissue burns more calories at rest than fat tissue. Strength training includes lifting weights, using resistance bands, or bodyweight exercises. Aim for¬†**at least two days of strength training per week, working all major muscle groups**.
* **High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT):**¬†HIIT involves short bursts of intense exercise followed by brief recovery periods. It's time-efficient and highly effective for calorie burning and improving fitness.¬†**Research shows HIIT to be effective in reducing abdominal fat.**
* **NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis):**¬†Don't underestimate the power of everyday movement! Increase your NEAT by taking the stairs, walking or cycling instead of driving short distances, standing more, and incorporating movement into your daily routine. NEAT can significantly contribute to your overall calorie expenditure.

**Variety is key to prevent boredom and work different muscle groups. Find activities you enjoy and that fit into your lifestyle. Even small amounts of activity are better than none!**

**How often should I exercise?**

Consistency is paramount. Aim for¬†**at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity cardio per week, plus two strength training sessions targeting all major muscle groups.**¬†per week as a starting point.

* **Listen to your body:**¬†Rest and recovery are just as important as exercise. Don't overtrain, which can lead to injury and burnout.
* **Progress gradually:**¬†If you're new to exercise, start slowly and gradually increase the intensity, duration, and frequency of your workouts.
* **Make it a habit:**¬†Schedule your workouts like any other important appointment and find ways to make exercise enjoyable and social.

**Weight Loss Through Diet and Exercise: More Frequently Asked Questions**

**(Keep the following sections, updated with more current and nuanced information)**

**Whole grains food examples:**

""These whole grains are rich in fiber and nutrients, contributing to satiety and long-term health, as recommended by established dietary guidelines such as¬†**the Dietary Guidelines for Americans**.""

**How to lose inner thigh fat fast with easy exercise?**

""It's a common desire to target fat loss in specific areas like the inner thighs, but unfortunately,¬†**""spot reduction"" is a myth.**¬†You can't choose where your body loses fat. To reduce inner thigh fat, you need to focus on overall weight loss through a combination of a calorie-controlled diet and regular exercise.

Exercises like squats, lunges, side leg raises, and standing hip abduction are excellent for¬†**strengthening and toning your inner thigh muscles.**¬†Incorporating resistance training with weights or bands will further enhance muscle development. Cardiovascular exercise like brisk walking, running, or cycling is essential for burning calories and reducing overall body fat, which will include fat from your inner thighs.

**Focus on a holistic approach: a healthy diet to create a calorie deficit and consistent exercise to burn calories and build muscle. Patience and consistency are key ‚Äì you'll see changes over time.**""

**How can a 51 woman lose weight?**

""Weight loss for women in their 50s requires a nuanced approach, acknowledging the physiological changes associated with perimenopause and menopause. Hormonal shifts can affect metabolism and fat distribution, and muscle mass naturally declines with age.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs particularly important for women in their 50s aiming to lose weight:

* **Prioritize Strength Training:**¬†Counteracting age-related muscle loss is crucial. Strength training is essential for boosting metabolism, maintaining bone density, and improving overall strength and function. Aim for¬†^(1)¬†at least two strength training sessions per week.[1. www.docsity.com](https://www.docsity.com/en/the-step-to-wellness/10890457/)[www.docsity.com](https://www.docsity.com/en/the-step-to-wellness/10890457/)
* **Focus on a Balanced Diet:**¬†A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats is vital. Pay attention to portion control and calorie intake while ensuring you're getting adequate nutrients.
* **Be Mindful of Hormonal Changes:**¬†Hormonal fluctuations can impact appetite, mood, and sleep, all of which can affect weight management. Stress management techniques and adequate sleep are particularly important.
* **Patience and Consistency are Key:**¬†Weight loss might be slower than in younger years, and that's perfectly normal. Focus on sustainable lifestyle changes and celebrate small victories.
* **Consult Your Doctor:**¬†It‚Äôs always wise for women in this age group to discuss weight loss goals with their doctor, especially if they have any health conditions or concerns. They can provide personalized advice and rule out any underlying medical issues.""

**How much weight will you lose if you only eat vegetables for a week?**

""While eating only vegetables for a week might lead to rapid weight loss, it's¬†**not a healthy, sustainable, or recommended approach.**¬†You will likely lose weight primarily due to water loss and calorie restriction, not necessarily fat loss.

Here‚Äôs why a vegetable-only diet is problematic:

* **Nutrient Deficiencies:**¬†Vegetables alone cannot provide all the essential nutrients your body needs, particularly protein, healthy fats, and certain vitamins and minerals. This can lead to nutrient deficiencies over time.
* **Muscle Loss:**¬†Without adequate protein, your body may break down muscle tissue for energy, which is counterproductive for long-term weight management.
* **Unsustainable and Restrictive:**¬†Such a restrictive diet is very difficult to maintain long-term and can lead to rebound weight gain once you resume normal eating.
* **Slowed Metabolism:**¬†Extreme calorie restriction can actually slow down your metabolism, making it harder to lose weight in the long run.

**Instead of extreme diets, focus on incorporating**¬†***more***¬†**vegetables into a**¬†***balanced***¬†**diet that includes lean protein, healthy fats, and whole grains. Sustainable weight loss is about making healthy, long-term changes, not quick fixes.**""

**How do you stop bloating and losing weight?**

""Bloating and weight loss are distinct issues, although they can sometimes be related. Bloating is usually temporary and not indicative of fat gain or loss. It's often caused by digestive issues.

Here are tips to reduce bloating:

* **Identify Trigger Foods:**¬†Common culprits include beans, lentils, cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cabbage), onions, garlic, and high-FODMAP foods. Keeping a food diary can help identify your triggers.
* **Eat Smaller, More Frequent Meals:**¬†Avoid overloading your digestive system with large meals.
* **Eat Slowly and Mindfully:**¬†Chew your food thoroughly and avoid gulping air while eating.
* **Limit Salt and Processed Foods:**¬†High-sodium foods can contribute to water retention and bloating.
* **Stay Hydrated:**¬†Drinking enough water can actually help reduce bloating by flushing out excess sodium.
* **Consider Probiotics:**¬†Some probiotics may help improve gut health and reduce bloating in certain individuals.¬†**Some research suggests certain strains of probiotics may be beneficial for reducing bloating, but evidence varies and is not conclusive for all types of bloating.**
* **Manage Stress:**¬†Stress can exacerbate digestive issues. Practice stress-reducing techniques like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing.
* **Rule Out Medical Conditions:**¬†If bloating is persistent or severe, consult your doctor to rule out underlying medical conditions like IBS, food intolerances, or celiac disease.

**Remember, bloating is not the same as gaining fat. Focus on consistent healthy eating and exercise habits for sustainable weight loss, and address bloating separately with lifestyle adjustments and medical advice if needed.**""

**How much weight should my 6 month old gain per week?**

""Average weight gain for a 6-month-old is approximately 4-7 ounces per week or about 1 pound per month. However,¬†**every baby's growth is unique.**¬†Growth charts provide general guidelines, but¬†**your pediatrician is the best resource for assessing your baby's individual growth and development.**

**It's crucial to rely on your pediatrician's guidance, not generic internet information, for your baby's health.**¬†Regular check-ups allow your pediatrician to monitor your baby's growth trajectory, ensure they are thriving, and address any concerns. If you have any questions about your baby's weight gain, always consult your pediatrician.""

**What can I eat on a dairy and gluten free diet?**

""A dairy and gluten-free diet can be both nutritious and varied! There are many delicious and healthy options available:

* **Naturally Dairy and Gluten-Free Foods:**¬†Fruits, vegetables, meat, poultry, fish, eggs, rice, quinoa, nuts, and seeds form the foundation.
* **Gluten-Free Grains:**¬†Beyond rice and quinoa, explore options like oats (certified gluten-free), buckwheat, and corn.
* **Dairy and Gluten-Free Alternatives:**¬†Plant-based milks (almond, coconut, oat, soy - unsweetened), gluten-free breads and pasta (check labels carefully).

**Important Considerations:**

* **Read Labels Diligently:**¬†Processed foods can often contain hidden dairy or gluten. Become a label-reading expert!
* **Nutrient Balance:**¬†Ensure you are getting all necessary nutrients, especially calcium and vitamin D if avoiding dairy, and fiber if avoiding gluten-containing grains.
* **Consult a Registered Dietitian:**¬†If you are following a dairy and gluten-free diet for medical reasons (like allergies or intolerances), a dietitian can provide personalized guidance to ensure nutritional adequacy and meal planning support.""

**How many grams of net carbs per day to lose weight?**

""**Net carbs**¬†are calculated by subtracting the grams of fiber from the total grams of carbohydrates in a food. The idea behind focusing on net carbs is that fiber is not fully digested and therefore has a minimal impact on blood sugar.

While some people find tracking net carbs helpful for weight loss, particularly in the short-term,¬†**there's no magic number of net carbs that guarantees weight loss for everyone.**¬†The ideal amount varies greatly depending on individual factors like activity level, metabolic rate, health conditions, and dietary preferences.

* **General Recommendations (Low-Carb Approaches):**¬†Some low-carbohydrate diets recommend aiming for 20-50 grams of net carbs per day. However, these are often very restrictive and not sustainable for everyone.
* **Focus on Overall Diet Quality:**¬†Instead of solely focusing on net carbs, prioritize the¬†*quality*¬†of your carbohydrate choices. Choose whole, unprocessed sources of carbohydrates like vegetables, fruits, and whole grains over refined grains and sugary foods.
* **Listen to Your Body:**¬†Pay attention to how you feel when you adjust your carbohydrate intake.
* **Consult a Professional:**¬†A registered dietitian or healthcare provider can help you determine the right carbohydrate intake for your individual needs and weight loss goals, considering your overall health and lifestyle.""

**Can emotional abuse cause weight loss?**

""Yes,¬†**emotional abuse can absolutely contribute to weight loss.**¬†The chronic stress, anxiety, and depression often associated with emotional abuse can significantly disrupt appetite, eating habits, and even digestion. This can manifest as decreased appetite, nausea, digestive problems, and unintentional weight loss.

**It's crucial to understand that weight loss in this context is a symptom of a much larger and more serious problem: emotional abuse.**¬†If you or someone you know is experiencing emotional abuse and weight loss, the¬†**absolute priority is to seek help for the abuse itself.**

* **Reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional immediately.**
* **Weight loss should not be the primary focus; addressing the abusive situation and ensuring safety and well-being is paramount.**
* **A mental health professional can help address the emotional trauma of abuse and provide guidance on healthy coping mechanisms and recovery.**¬†They can also help address any resulting eating issues or health problems, including weight loss, once the abusive situation is being addressed.""

**Conclusion:**

Weight loss through diet and exercise is a journey, not a race. Focus on building sustainable healthy habits, prioritize whole foods and regular physical activity you enjoy, and be patient with yourself. Remember, personalized advice from healthcare professionals, like registered dietitians and doctors, is invaluable for creating a weight management plan that is safe, effective, and tailored to your unique needs.

*Reposted. I'm a moron and had multiple issues in the other one. It's also LONG for a reddit post. Sorry. I hope you enjoy.* 

A lot of being in the Army is being bored. There is so much that is mundane that it can't be helped. So you try to put it to good use where you can. For example, during Desert Shield, I ran a PMCS on our Vulcan so often that it never broke down. Because I had the time to do so. But I wrote about that before. And while I was bored in Saudi Arabia for the most part, this is about a time of boredom in America.

During my third or fourth FTX with A 5/62 at Fort Bliss as a new soldier, we were again in White Sands, NM, ""playing Army."" Being a newly stood up unit after being reorganized, we were engaged in practicing and refining our training. That kind of constant rehearsal is why the American Army is so damn good. In any case, our focus for this FTX was concealment and security. 

At the time, I wasn't on a Vulcan yet. I was in a two man team on a HMMWV as were most Stinger gunners in the Army. Our Platoon Sergeant gave each team a grid square in White Sands before we drove out of the side gate and left Texas that we were expected to be at. We also had to set up a secondary position, and pick out a tertiary position. The primary absolutely had to be in that grid square or you failed. The other two had to be in or very close to the square, so they could be over the border into the next one a bit.

We convoyed out of Fort Bliss, into White Sands, then staged for a final briefing.

White Sands can be hard to navigate. From my experience, it is nothing but sand dunes and yucca plants. Half the roads that are on the official Army maps weren't there anymore due to erosion, and half the roads in the desert weren't on the map. And all of the roads were made of sand, which meant no signage or other road markers. So you had to navigate. I HATE being lost. So I made sure to ace land navigation during Basic and AIT. I never got lost. I still can't get lost in the wilderness today if I have a map and a compass. It was a boring class, but I paid attention and became very competent.

The only way to reliably navigate pre-GPS with the tools we had was complicated. The maps were in kilometers, while our vehicle odometers were in miles. Sigh. So to get to point A, you draw a straight line between the two and measure the distance in kilometers and take a bearing with your compass so you know what direction to go in. Then you convert that to miles. 

This was the fun part. A lot of the guys in my unit weren't real bright. Of course, you could argue that **I** wasn't that bright since I had such a high ASVAB score and picked ADA, but here we are. Anyway, most of these cats couldn't do basic math. Some hadn't finished high school and were in on waivers. So before we left the rally point for the battery inside of White Sands, the Platoon Sergeant hollered at me.

*""COBB! Get your ass over here and show these guys how to do this.""*

The class was showing them how to convert from miles to kilometers and back again. I guess even back then I had the makings of a teacher in me. Heh. All I know is Sarge was tired of giving the same class over and over. I rolled the map out on the hood of the HMMWV, pulled out a compass and a grease pencil, then showed them how I was getting from the rally point to my position. When I looked around to see how my lesson went, they were looking at me like I had just brought Jesus back to life. Witchcraft or something. It was so easy it wasn't computing with some of them. So I ran through it again, and we made sure that at least all the team chiefs got it, but by the second time most of the drivers did too. Really, probably only about half of the guys needed the refresher course though, I was far from the only competent one. The Vulcan platoons were having their meetings and similar refresher courses around us.

The yucca plants were protected or something, and we weren't supposed to mess with them. But I liked driving over dunes instead of around them. It was easier to keep the compass on a heading and it didn't throw off your distance measurement the way swerving around dunes did - that's how a lot of guys got lost. Well, that and I laughed when we drove over the plants and the pods blew up. Like I said, boredom. But we got to our position and got it set up. For the primary, we were expected to dig a small ASP (Ammo Storage Point), a reinforced two man fighting position with cover, and we had to camouflage our vehicle as best as we could with our camo nets. We carried empty sandbags and some scrap 2 x 4s and plywood in the back of the HMMWVs under the missile rack to do this with, it was part of our loadout in Texas and Korea.

The secondary position needed to have a smaller two man fighting position that was well camouflaged, but didn't have to be reinforced with a cover and no ASP. The tertiary position was just a dot on a map and didn't require any prep. The secondary and tertiary were for after we fired our first loadout or if one position was compromised in some way.

The messed up part was when the NCOs wanted to role play. Sometimes during an FTX, they would randomly decide your team position was compromised. If we got that call, we had to break down our position then move to the secondary and improve it to first position standards. Then we had to improve our tertiary position to secondary position standards, and then pick out a new tertiary position.

Those days SUCKED. Thankfully, this wasn't one of them.

The NCOs were supposed to come by sometime after lunch. My TC and I worked backwards. After we found our primary position, we looked around and at the map before picking a tertiary about 700 meters away. Then we chose a secondary about 400 meters from that one, forming a rough triangle. We drove over to prep the secondary position, where we dug out a fighting position and camouflaged it as best we could with some dead plants and whatnot, then drove to the primary.

We were done with the primary position in two hours, but we worked at it another full hour before we were happy. We wanted it to be better than ""pass"" - we wanted it to be good. Being the gunner, the team chief made me walk about 500 meters out to see how good of a job we did. I couldn't see shit. Even at 100 meters I wasn't sure if it was netting or plant leaves I was looking at. We did a good job, especially because a big chunk of the blocky looking HMMWV was hiding behind the dune we had dug into, breaking up the outline of the truck and the nets over it. The metal poles we carried for the netting were propping the net up on one side to give the impression the dune was longer than it was, further concealing the truck under the net and partially behind the dune.

I trudged back, cursing the heat, and we ate lunch. As I slurped down some Ramen and enjoyed the burn of the tabasco, I looked around. The very small road that wound its way near our position had another large dune about 50 meters away from us that was much closer to the road, which is why we hadn't picked it. I felt the beginnings of an idea. By time I finished eating and had some water, I had a plan.

*""Hey D - how tired are you?""* He threw me some side eye. *""Why?""* I laid out my plan.

A couple hours later, the New Mexico/Texas sun had passed the zenith, and the day was reaching peak temperature before it would drop off to something really pleasant before dark. We were exhausted from the extra work, but this was going to be worth it. Eventually, the expected radio call came in.

*""Team 4, this is Blaster 2. Come in, over.""* Our platoon sergeant. Blaster 1 was our LT, but I had no idea what he was doing. Probably polishing the brigade commander's boots or something. *""Blaster 2, Team 4. Over.""*

*""Give me the coordinates of your primary, over.""* And here is where my Team Chief and I show we were paying attention in our OPSEC and COMSEC briefings. See, you are expected to authenticate who you are, by giving me a response to a pre-chosen passphrase. These are stored in a little codebook. Each day you have a different one. So I responded appropriately. *""That's a negative. Authenticate Whiskey Hotel.""*

See, we were taught in Basic and in subsequent trainings that even though our radios were encrypted, we had to assume that either someone was listening, or those sneaky Russians had captured a radio and were using English speakers to fuck with us. So you play the game with the NCOs. You demand they authenticate, and they try to bully you into talking to them without it. They had successfully gotten two teams to fall for it as the rest of the platoon listened in on the radio, and were in trouble as a result. So we went back and forth for almost five minutes, with our Platoon Sergeant breaking all radio protocol and cussing us out in an effort to get us to break. He didn't get us to quit, so he finally gave in.

Once he gave us the proper response, we let him know where we were at, and sat back to wait. After probably 30 minutes, we hear the diesel engine of another HMMWV coming close to our position. I held my rifle tight, a bit nervous. I had to stop him before he got too close to us or we failed the exercise. As he rolled into our AO, he stopped. Before the engine had completely stopped running, he was out of his HMMWV, facing our fighting position, screaming bloody murder.

*""What the fuck is this shit!? I saw this sorry ass position from over 100 meters out. You two assholes aren't stopping shit! Why the hell didn't one of you challenge me before I got here? Why could I see your antenna from way the hell out there? What the fuck....""* That's when he felt my rifle pressed into his back. 

See, he wasn't at our position. What I had seen during lunch was that the other dune was large enough to make a fighting position in, but we chose this one because it was farther off the road. So we set up a decoy position in that one after lunch. Why? Because it was tactically sound, we were bored, and this would be funny. We dug down just deep enough to make it look at first glance like it was a position. We got some sticks from the yucca plants and taped them up with duct tape to make them long enough to pass for antennas. Those we stuck straight up, whereas the antennas on our vehicle were bent over in an arc and secured beneath the net. We had taken a camo net we didn't need and just half ass threw it over the ""fighting position"" in the sloppiest manner possible. We left tons of boot prints all over the front of that area, but had swept them with yucca leaves by the real one. I had been laying down behind a smaller dune, so when Sarge got out, he had his back to me.

*""Bang! Sorry, Sarge.""* That's when my TC came out from our real position farther away with his rifle also pointed at Sarge. The look on our Sergeant's face was worth it. The three of us started laughing. It was doubled over, knee slapping, ""holy fuck you got me"" laughter and it went on for minutes. Then we showed him our real position, which he complimented, then pointed out the other two on the map, and off he went to see them. 

We got an ""attaboy"" from him later in formation after the FTX was over, so that was nice. 

I was still bored though. Not much to do really. Thankfully I pre-planned. So on day 2, I cleaned the FUCK out of my rifle. I was not going to sit around for two or three hours trying to get all the sand out of it tomorrow after we were done. It was bad enough we had to drive the trucks and tracks to the wash facility and then do a full PMCS on them all when we got back. If I didn't have to fuck with my rifle, I could actually be ahead of schedule. Hell yeah. So I spent the day cleaning while we were supposed to be ""looking for enemy aircraft."" Besides, the only one we saw was a 737 headed to the El Paso airport. When I was done, I wrapped it up in a black garbage bag and tied it tight. 

A little later, my TC saw me reading a book and my bag wrapped rifle laid across my lap. *""What the hell, Cobb?""* So I explained. *""You do realize your rifle needs to be immediately ready, right?*"" He could have made me take it out of the bag, but he didn't. 

Things went as predicted. In the morning, we woke up. Being on a two man team, you are constantly exhausted as you still have to keep watch. We just broke it up into two shifts. It was always informal on every team I was on. You are all up at night until someone decides to go to bed. At that point, night watch begins. You have to be up at whatever time, so you take the hours left between then and now and divide it up between your 2-4 man team, depending on your battery and platoon configuration.

Around 0500 though, we were both up and heating water in our canteen cups on the engine for coffee while we choked down MREs and laughed about surprising Sarge the day before. Then we broke down our position and cleaned up, filling in our fighting position, dumping sandbags, recovering plywood. After that, we drove to our secondary and restored it as best we could. Believe it or not, the Army was very environmentally aware back then, at least at Fort Bliss. I wasn't - I was murdering yucca plants. 

Then we drove to the rally point near the Texas border, and from there convoyed in. We ran the battery's vehicles through the wash facility. Drive back to the motor pool and do the PMCS. Then we go to turn in rifles. Here is where we would all go sit it in the PT area outside the back of our barracks and clean our rifles while we smoked and joked, and talked about the drinking and fucking we would do after evening formation and chow.

Not me, because I was done already.

I SPRINTED from the motor pool to the armory downstairs from the barracks. First in line, because there was no line. It was still around 1500, there wouldn't be a line for at least 30 minutes. As I ran, I tore off the garbage bag, stuffing the remains in my pockets so I wouldn't be yelled at for littering. I heard someone ask what the fuck my problem was. I flew down the stairs in a rush, then burst into the armory, thrusting my rifle at the man in charge. 

CPL Perez gave my M-16 the hard eye. Then again. Then a third time. He looked up at me, almost in disbelief. He was used to turning away the first several rifles. Guys were always in a hurry after an FTX to get out of there, so they did a half ass job and hoped they would slip by. Perez turned and looked at the clock, then back at me. Again, just like the guys and the map reading, almost accusing me of witchcraft, because there was no way I was done this early. Grudgingly, he pronounced my rifle clean, we signed the control book, and I walked over to the DFAC for an early dinner before evening formation and dismissal. After, I went and showered and shaved. I threw on my old uniform long enough to make formation, but I was in my civvies ten minutes after that, and at the bowling alley 20 minutes later. Frank, Johnny and Eddie showed up about 90 minutes later.

I got hammered as hell that night. Hitting the bars even a little early makes a huge difference. And the hangover was brutal.

But, I also really shined with my leadership. I taught a bunch of guys how to navigate a changing desert without getting lost. We set up a great position and showed our capability for deception as we would in war. I kept my equipment in good working order. I got my work done early.

FTXs really do suck pretty hard, but boredom breeds competency.

**Aug 29 2021**

I don't even even know how to feel right now. Despite reading so many reddit posts for so long , I used to feel that when I get into a relationship I would definitely be more cautious. But looks like fate didn't want to it for me.



I(26M) and my gf(26F) let's call her sarah were in a relationship for about 3 years. It all started when were doing our masters, I used to have a crush on her and through a truth or dare game we ended making out. Turns out she too had a crush on me (which shocked me since she was the most attractive girl I have ever known). We began hanging out alot and and surprisingly she asked me out. We had alot of fun together she legit felt like the perfect partner and I don't think I could love anyone more. I am Indian and i was living in london.She is half indian and half british. Despite being a bit conservative my parents loved her alot and my friends used to keep nudging us to get married. After our masters both of us got great jobs. I mean i did so good during my masters that my starting salary was 6 digits. It was so great to have such a good job and such an amazing girlfriend and group of friends that I felt the luckiest person ever and I had even planned to propose to Sarah and the only person who knew this was my mom who wanted to help me make it the best proposal ever.


Now starts the part where everything just fucked up to the core. My best friends(lets call him ryan) and I have been best friends for almost 8 yrs. I mean I legit consider him as my brother. He had a girlfriend(lets call her tanya).They had been together for 4 yrs and had also met each other when they were in college(all four of us:me,sarah,ryan and tanya went to the same college for graduation and for masters). One day Sarah and I were chilling in the park. I got a phone call from Tanya saying that she wanted something from my house(Sarah and I were living together at this point). So I went to our house and Tanya was waiting outside my house. I gave her the keys and while I was there i got a call from my mom who told that my dad had a stroke and I had to rush almost halfway through Europe . I texted Sarah asap regarding this and rushed to the train station with a bag. I reached there on time and due to god's grace my dad was well. There was still no response from Sarah which surprised me alot. I tried calling her but she wont return my calls. The day after I go to my house with flowers like I usually did when I went home from work. I enter the house and hear someone moaning from the master bed room. I freeze for 3 seconds. I know what was happening and I walk towards the room and open the door and I see my best friends of 8 years having sex with my girl friend. I was numb. I couldn't even comprehend what was happening. They both freeze too after seeing. The flowers and my bag fell from my hand. Controlling my emotions and I ran out of the house and sat in the taxi and asked the driver to just drive away.


My mind was still trying to comprehend what had happened and despite being a strong person on the inside I started crying. The cab driver was a bit aged man who was shocked to see my sudden reaction. He stopped the car and believe it or not actually comforted me (he didn't exactly hug me but he was patting my shoulder and my back). I ended up going to a pub(even though I do not drink). I called over a friend of mine who I had known since school times. She came over and picked me up. She drove me to her place(she was newly married and lived with her husband who was a good friend of mine). I poured my heart out and bless them for their caring behavior and attitude. They let me sleep on their couch. During all this I was surprised not to receive any calls from Sarah or Ryan (not like I would have picked it up), it just made me feel so low that I had such a horrible gf and best friend who didn't even have the fucking courtesy to call after what they had done. I slept vowing never to even acknowledge them in my life. I wake up at 3am in the night with around 100 messages from Sarah and Ryan. A million calls from Sarah. I didn't bother about it. I put my phone on silent and went to sleep. I woke up at 9, I called my boss and told him what happened and I need a day off. He was such an amazing boss he not only gave a week off but he invited me over to his house to talk if I ever needed to. I legit thanked so many times and he said he understands. The phone calls and messaged had doubled since I last saw them at 3am. I am still at my friend's house. She too took a day off and consoled to me. I ended up telling her that I was going to propose to sarah and my plans after. I broke down again and she hugged for a while. She told me that though it is hard I can't let my emotions overwhelm me because I needed to be strong for myself. She even told me that I could take a small mini vacation and that she and her husband have no problem having me at their place for as long as it required. She got a call from her office and she told me that she had to leave due to a sudden emergency at the office. After she left I opened my laptop and here I am writing about my heartbreak.

**Aug 30 2021, 1 day later**


I met Tanya and after the events that followed I dont know what to believe and I very badly need advices for what I am about to convey. It maybe long but please do read it.

So at around 9am Tanya came to my friends house, clearly she had been crying cuz she looked very pale and had bloodshot eyes. I gave her a quick hug and we sat down for breakfast. She didn't say anything at all, I understood that she was waiting for us to be alone. After reassuring me a bit my friend and her husband left for work. Tanya and I sat down on the couch. I touched her shoulder and asked how she was doing. She looked at me teary eye and suddenly broke down hugging me. I though she too was feeling hurt and needed to cry it out. She started mumbling that she is sorry and that it's her fault. I was sure she must be blaming herself for not being there for Ryan or she felt bad for what happened to me. I told her that it is not her fault and that they are to blame for our pain. When we broke the hug she just held my hand and told me that she needed to confess something. I was scared as to what she had to say in such a situation.

She 1st confesses saying that she had an affair with one of her ex for who she met at her work place. It had been going on for a few months. The day she had called and asked for my house keys she had planned to meet her AP there. So apparently after I left with my stuff she and AP did it in my house(I was fucking shocked). It turns out during this time Sarah had come back to our house and found Tanya having sex with her AP in her room. At this point I really was wondering if my house was a fucking place where people had sex whenever they felt like it.

I was silent for a minute and asked her that Ryan too cheated on you so why are you saying it is your fault that I was cheated on. So apparently(here comes the part that Idk if i should believe) tanya's ap had his back towards the door and when Sarah entered the room she thought it was Me and Tanya having sex. I laughed,I legit laughed and told her that ,it was a nice story now tell me the truth. She took her phone out and showed her conversation between her AP,Sarah and Ryan(separately). The convos basically included things where Sarah calls Tanya names and that I was unfaithful to her and had the nerve to use the excuse of my father's stroke to throw her off. Tanya didn't even try telling that it wasn't me . So it turns out that Sarah and Ryan were influenced by some of our mutual friends to have a revenge affair on us(me and tanya). They at first denied since they felt uncomfortable but after alot of nudging they finally did it. The day I returned from the hospital where my father was when they planned to do it.

She further explains that she was called to my house after I left. By then Sarah and Ryan both were shocked with my behavior, the flowers and my tickets and bills. They fucking called my mom to confirm if I indeed had visited them and my mom confirmed it. It's when tanya spilled the beans that she was having sex with her ex and not me and that I was still faithful to Sarah. This is when reality apparently hit both Ryan and Sarah. Ryan apparently slapped Tanya(which wasn't the kind of attitude I was expecting from him). Sarah screamed and broke down crying.

Turns out that since then they have been calling me and trying to reach out after realising that they were the one who ended up breaking my trust.

When tanya finished talking my first instinct told me to shout at her and kick her out of the house but I was so emotionally drained that I started to cry and suddenly began laughing. I looked at her and asked her just one question, ""Are you telling the truth"", Tanya says that she swears on her father's grave that she is telling the truth and that she is really sorry for what she caused me. She broke down crying real hard. I just sat there quite for a while. I asked for her phone and took the screenshots and sent it to myself. I asked to her to leave the house and never try to contact me ever again. She pleaded saying that she didn't mean to do that. I lost my temper and shouted saying yes u fucking meant to cheat on ur boyfriend, yes u did want to destroy my relationship cuz u destroyed urs. Do u think I would be the same after this ,do u think u will be the same. I cursed and said alot of mean things to her. She finally left and before going she said she always thought to me a perfect guy for any girl and she regrets what she did. I just retaliated and told her that her regret and apology wont change what has already happened. She left crying and I too was so affected that I too began crying. My friend was back home and shocked to see my situation. She sat down with me and I told her everything. She told me not to believe tanya since she is a cheater and a liar, tho she told me that I should maybe read Sarah's and Ryan's text if not respond atleast read to see how much truth is there in Tanya's story.

1. After Tanya left I had a talk with nikki.. She suggested I read the text messages sent by Ryan and Sarah. I took her advice and I read a few of them. It included things(by Sarah) like I messed up plz call back.. It's all a mistake.. I love you.. Plz let me explain.. (By Ryan)bro I am very sorry plz let me explain I dont have any feelings for sarah I don't love her please let me explain.. It included the same story that Tanya told.. As suggested by few of u, I assumed they planned.. And I connected with Tanya's ap(nikki's idea).. I called him we talked for a bit and I decided to meet him in a near by coffee shop.. I told him not to let anyone know we r meeting else I would mess his career up(I could inform his hr regarding his behavior with colleague etc).. We met soon after and after seeing him for the first time I felt maybe Tanya wasn't lying. Here is y:
2. he has a similar physique as mine(muscular, tanned) tho he was 5'11 and I was 6'1.
3. we did fancy a similar hair style.
4. he had a tattoo on the back of his neck that looked exactly like mine.. Mine is a chakra(from hindu myth).. His was a sun with similar design.
5. Nikki was with me(god I owe my life to her.. Many ppl asked me to not stay at her place as she is newly married but she didn't let me leave when I tried, she told me that she will be with me throughout). I asked a few questions like how long he was having an affair with Tanya and y did he do such a disgusting act of sleeping with someone who is in a relationship. He apologized (like Tanya).. I was really angry but I didn't want to create a scene. I asked him to never contact tanya Or any of her friends again and not repeat such an act ever again. After nikki and I reached my home (I had asked Sarah to leave through a friend who passed my message)she told me that maybe Tanya wasn't lying and I should talk to Sarah only if I feel it's worth my time. I asked her opinion she said that meeting her won't change anything but u might get closure and answers u seek(tbh I want answers, I am not able to move on without them).. I called my mom to confirm things suggested by redditers.. She did confirm that Sarah had called to ask if my father was ok and how his health was... I told her everything(abt meeting Tanya's ap as she knew other things already)and asked for her opinion.. She told me that may be if meeting her gives me me closure and answers then i should meet her but with someone (obviously nikki was coming with me).. I didn't want to text or call her so I told nikki to do so.. She called Sarah and asked her to meet me at my home the next day. According to nikki Sarah sounded broken almost as if somebody had made her swallow glass and was being choked (wtf that means no idea). I didn't feel any sympathy which was not a good sign for someone who I would have died for.

**Sept 4 2021, 1 day later, 6 days since original post**

Nikki and I were waiting at my house for Sarah to show up. Sarah shows up at around 10 am. Nikki answers the door I was sitting in the living room with screenshots of texts and messages printed, the ones I found suspicious.

Sarah comes in the living room and seeing her brought down every single emotion I have known on me like a sudden bucket dump. She looked real miserable, her eyes were sunken and clearly she hadn't slept in a while. Even though she looked like she had showered and gotten ready(somewhat),tear marks were visible on her face. She was literally shivering as she walked in. As soon as she saw she rushed towards but Nikki stopped her from doing so and told her that they will be no physical contact and only verbal discussion. She again broke down crying and finally sat on the chair opposite to mine. nikki made sure to sit in a way such that she could stop sarah if she plans to come at me again. I though I was ready to talk, I wasn't. I felt so much pain looking at her(it included pain of seeing her in such a horrible state,pain of what she did to me etc). But nikki pressed my hand and nodded showing her support.Nikki starts by asking her to repeat the events that happened. She told the entire story and it did match with Tanya's story and my research. As suggested by others it might be pre planned. I then spoke and talked to Sarah.The conversation went something like this:

> Me: How long have you been cheating on me and how many times have you done it?

> Sarah: I swear I never cheated on you before. And I never loved anyone but you. I didn't even cheat on you.

> Me: Having intercourse with someone who is not your boyfriend and still being in a relationship seems like cheating to me.

> Sarah: It was a mistake,it was not supposed to happen I was deceived and lied too.

> Me: So you willingly getting naked with my best friend happened by mistake. You having intercourse with him whilst being in a relationship with me happened accidently.

> Sarah: Tanya lied to me that you and her were sleeping together and what I saw just confirmed it.

> Me: So you saw me with her,while I was almost 100 miles away visiting my father who nearly died.

> Sarah: Tanya's AP had the same tattoo as you, I thought it was you.

> Me: So you decided to have sex with Ryan without thinking about confronting me then and there. Why didn't you respond to my message. I texted you saying that I was visiting my father due to emergency.

> Sarah: I thought you were making an excuse so I dont suspect you were cheating on me.

> Me: How could you even think that I would use my father's health as an excuse,you knew he was unwell and you dare to accuse me of using him as a medium to cheat on you. Tell me something,in the last three years that we have been together have I given you any reason that I cannot be trusted or I dont love you. When was the last time you thought I was suspicious.

> Sarah: Never you were perfect,you loved me and cared for me,you were the best thing that could ever happen to me.

> Me: I loved you and cared for you and yet you thought I would betray you and leave you for someone else.

> Sarah: I am sorry,I let my emotions get the better of me and(she named a few friends here) kept saying that she deserves better and maybe she should have revenge on me with Ryan.

> Me: And you agreed?

> Sarah: I didn't at first, I was against this but seeing how heartbroken Ryan was , I thought you were evil and the fact that everyone kept telling Ryan and me to do it didn't help me think and I went with it.

> Me: So you love Ryan more than me, I am such a fool to even think about planning my life with you,marrying u and what not. I was so sure about us that I was going to propose to you, I wanted you in my life,but now knowing you love him more, I think it's best we never see each other again.

> Sarah starts crying very hard.

> sarah: I dont love Ryan,not even a single cell of me feels that way for him. I love you. I would have said yes to marry you a million times,please I am sorry I messed up,I always loved you and you only.

> Me: You gave him sympathy sex and you are calling it a mistake.(I said this loudly)

> Sarah: No I didn't even want to sleep with him, what are you talking about?

> Me: You admitted to be feeling bad to see him heartbroken and with a little nudge you slept with him, that is sympathy sex and I was gone for two days and god knows how many times my bed was used for your worthless sympathy sex.

> Sarah gets hysterical at this point,crying her eyes out,and saying things like I love you, and I swear we did it only once and it had only one objective and that was revenge.

> Me: I loved you,knowing that come what may this girl will stand by me in my sorrows,pain and happiness. I was so happy to have someone like you but now you have destroyed my trust, my love and me.

> Sarah: Plz dont say that, I dont have any feeling for Ryan and I never did. I love you with my heart give me a chance please, I will do whatever you want me to do,even at the cost of letting you have sex with any girl in front of me a hundred times I am ready.

> Me: That's the difference between you and me , I would rather suffer in pain and heal than cause pain to others by getting my revenge on them.

> Sarah: Dont say that please, I cant imagine my life without you, you are my soulmate I know it.

> Me: The soulmate who you distrusted. The soulmate who you thought was being unfaithful to you. The soulmates you thought didn't love you anymore.

> Sarah: I am sorry I swear i wont do such a thing again, I will go to therapy work on my emotions and control over them but please dont end our relationship because of what tanya made me do.

> Me: Tanya told you to distrust me,Tanya told you give Ryan sympathy sex,Tanya told you to get naked with him, ANSWER ME!!!

> Sarah: I am sorry I should have known better than to trust a cheater, I shouldn't have to listened to (she names the friends again). I love you and I will never stop loving you pleases give me a chance.

> Me: Your apologies,your I love you's wont undo what has happened. It wont remove the picture of my gf and best friend having sex from my mind. You had someone else inside you when you were with me,you cannot take that back. You cheated on me,whether or whether not you did out of pleasure or revenge,doesn't matter. You had someone else in you and you cant change it or undo it.

Sarah cried and continued with the I love you's and i am sorry plz take me back i dont wanna live without you in my life.

I looked at Nikki and clearly she saw the pain in my eyes, she asked sarah to leave, Sarah refused and told that she loves me and that she wants to be with me forever. Nikki didn't want more drama and asked her leave or we shall get a restraining order on her. Unwillingly she got up and Nikki escorted her out,while leaving Sarah kept repeating please dont end us,we are stronger and better ,i love you please give a second chance.

As soon as she was out of sight I slipped from sofa and fell on the floor crying and thinking how I ended up in such a bad situation. Nikki sat next to me and comforted me. She told me to rest and that we will talk about this later,she helped me to the guest room and I was so exhausted I fell asleep. I woke up and saw nikki's husband by my bed working on his laptop. I was surprised to see him and he told me that nikki had to run a few errands and she didn't want to leave me alone so she requested her husband to give me company. I cried a bit and hugged him and told him that I owe my life to them and that I will be with them forever and help them anytime they need my help. He told me its ok and that knowing my parents too need my help he wanted to make sure I can get better so I could help my parents.

In the last 24 hours a reality hit me that I have been very selfish. I have been focusing on my pain for so long I forgot I had to be strong for my parents who need me right now.

**Sept 6 2021, 2 days later, 8 days since original post**

*Editor's summary: OOP visits their parents, gets advice from his mother, returns home and gets more advice from Nikki. They then reach out to Sarah to meet again.*

I called up Sarah and told her that I have come to a decision and I needed to talk to her. She reached my place within 20 minutes. Luckily for me she didn't try doing anything though she kept saying that she loves me , we can work this out and lot of other things. Before I told her my decision, I wanted a few answers that a few redditors suggested I asked because they found her answers suspicious.

> Me: I want an honest answer and you cannot lie because I have my evidences(my bluff), have you ever cheated on me before?

> Sarah- No never, I never even let that thought come to me. Many of our friends had crushes on me(this was news to me) and used to flirt but I never responded back to them.

> Me- How many times did you have sex with Ryan?

> She starts bawling and saying that she loves me and it meant nothing.

> Me: Just answer my question?

> Sarah: We did it twice,the day you saw us and the night before.

Many redditors had suggested that the time I caught her cannot be their first time, and her answer just confirmed. It dawned to me that she did it twice meaning she wanted more after the first. Even if there was a single cell that still loved her and cared for her died right there. I looked at Nikki she looked at me and slightly nod her head. I looked back at Sarah.

> Me: OK. I got my answers. I am going to ask you to leave and never try to contact me again and that I need my space and that the relationship is over.

This news hit her real bad cuz she fell on her knees hugged my legs and started crying. I told her this was of no use and she should continue her relationship with Ryan or with someone else and that I am not the right person for her. She kept saying please dont it end, you are my life , my happiness I dont wanna lose you. I told her that I dont care and that if she doesn't leave right now it wont be good for her. She refused to move and not even threatening the cops flinched her. She looked at me said I dont care whoever tries to stop me, I love you and will always do forever. I gently pusher away and freed myself from her hug. I told her that it's over and that she needs to move on. It was getting out of hand so Nikki literally dragged her away from me( I wanted to call the cops but didn't want to cause problems). I however called the cops and got restraining order on her, just to make sure she doesn't cause issues. She has been constantly messaging and calling. I finally blocked her(i know took me a while). Few of our mutual friends tried contacting but I blocked the ones I knew who were a bad influence. I was a mess and still am right now, I asked Nikki to leave because I felt like she had done alot and this healing process I must do alone. She refused but I begged her and she unwillingly left. I am feeling alot of pain but I know this pain will get over soon. I had loved Sarah alot. Thought it was only 3 years I felt like I have been in love with her my whole life. And removing someone takes a toll. I however deep inside feel relief knowing that life will get better and that I wont be haunted from my past as I have decided to let go.

*Editor's summary: OOP received more support from Nikki and clarified that Ryan ""doesn't exist for them anymore"" and is NC. OOP has not told their father of the situation*

A few of my friends(who pushed for revenge affair) have been trying to call me and apologise and what not. One of those friends even showed up at my place saying that she is sorry for what she did. I told her that idc what she has to say, I dont consider her or any of them as my friends anymore. She told me that Sarah is horrible and that she has been crying non stop ever since she left my place.She tells me that Sarah hasn't been eating properly she tried to harm her self(not suicide) but hitting herself on the mirror , slapping herself and lot of other stuff. I told her that the way you helped her have a revenge affair , I am sure you can help her move on too. She tried to say more but I shut the door in her face. According to my friends who I trust,they have been receiving non stop calls and messages from Sarah since I blocked her everywhere,they tell me they havent responded and that they plan to keep it that way. I was really glad to hear that.

OOP talks with trustworthy friends first who tell them that the RA friends had crushes on OOP and Sarah and indicate that is their motivation for breaking them up.

[**UPDATE 8:I had a talk with the RA friends**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Large_Sentence7694/comments/pv0ytv/update_8i_had_a_talk_with_the_ra_friends/) 

**Sept 25 2021, 6 days later, 27 days since original post**

So yes I did have a talk with the RA friends. I first had a talk with two girls from our group who according to Sarah had proposed the idea(fyi i recorded the meet and had my friends with me). So they both were super apologetic and kept saying that they shoudn't have urged Sarah to do what she did..One of them confesses that because she had a crush on me she thought this as a good idea to break Sarah and I off.. I ask her that in her eyes I was a cheater so why would she want to be in a relationship with me knowing I so called cheated on Sarah. She said that at that moment she only bothered about breaking my relationship with Sarah up and that's why she planted the idea of RA. I asked her if she has been on contact with Sarah, she responds saying that Sarah has blocked her and few of them for the past few days. I then ask both of them y they did that..just having a crush on me doesn't justify taking such a rash decision...I asked them that we have been friends for so long..y didn't u call me to curse me or call me names when they found out. So apparently they all had promised to go NC with me(wow, stupidity at it's peak)..

I then asked her that does Sarah have feelings for Ryan , they respond saying that she doesn't, I then ask them if they knew that Sarah slept with him twice.. They said no that they only know about the time they did it in the night the day before I caught them...

After a few more questions I told them that I am really hurt getting betrayed not by just the love of my life but also my friends who were my support. They both get emotional saying that they are sorry and that they promise not to take such immature decision. I forgave them but asked them stay out my life as I dont need their toxic nature in my life...They were really hurt by this, they asked if we could be atleast in contact once a while, I said no...I left soon after...and I met with few guys who gave similar responses although one of them was pissed of at me for breaking Sarah's heart(what in the actual fuck)...I basically ignored and figured that he has a big time crush on Sarah and what not. And now the fact that blew my mind was that few of them knew about Tanya's affair with her AP..Boy that one hit me like a bag of bricks..I was so mind fucked that I couldn't sit there for longer.

So after the meet my friends and I had a talk at my place. The one who theorized that RA was cuz the friends had crush on me or sarah...we discussed further if I plan to meet sarah. I finally unblocked sarah on my phone, I ignored all her messages and sent her a text that I would meet her on Sunday and if she can come.

**Sept 27 2021, 2 days later, 29 days since original post**

So I finally met Sarah and I dont think I plan to meet her again for atleast sometime...So she shows up at my place and this time I did it alone without anyone(no nikki and no friends)...She arrives and when I saw her I honestly felt like someone punched me in the gut...She was really miserable..She had a few marks on her faces , a few bandages on her wrist( I was really freaked out at this point), clearly she had been beating herself up as I was told by one of the RA friends...She looks at me teary eyed and hugs me....I let it stay for a few seconds before pushing her back..We sit in the drawing room...We talked for a long time...So I am gonna just show the convo in a nutshell:

> Me: Before we start I just want to be clear that I wont be reconciling and that you should get that thing out of her head.

> She just nods.

> Me: Why are you hurting yourself like this, do you really think I feel happy when you are hurting yourself this way?

> She: I cant forgive myself for what I did...I admit to have done it twice but not out of pleasure but because I wanted to hurt you more.

> Me: I am not here to talk to you about that anymore..I didn't call you for this.

> She: I know what I did was wrong... I was rash, immature and stupid...I shouldn't have been so carried away with my emotions, I shouldn't have distrusted you. It's just that I loved you so much and that I used always feel you loved me just as much but when I thought you were being unfaithful all that love converted to hatred for what I thought you did.. I am sorry I shouldn't have been so stupid..Please I dont want to move on in life without having you in it...I cant..

> Me: It's good you understand what mistakes you have made and I hope you wont repeat those in you future relationships.... Look I dont think you harming yourself will change what has happened...And at this point you are hurting yourself and me too..So I am gonna ask you to stop doing it...

> She: How can I forgive myself for what I did...I legit destroyed a relationship which I thought was broken but was actually perfect in every way..I realized how lucky I was to be in such a good relationship and how I hurted the person who I thought was bad but was actually the person who cared for me the most...I know I have even destroyed you and us and I cannot let myself live with that pain and guilt.

I then tell her about the RA friends and the guy who had a crush on her etc..After listening to the recording she burried her face in her palms and began crying and saying things like why did this happen to me...why did I listen to them...

I then explained her that there is something broken in our relationship that cannot be fixed...I however told her that I am willing to be just ""friends"" with her and that she can approach but only for emergencies , but for now I want my space and I dont want her to do anything foolish and try to move on with her life..

She asked if there was a possibility that we get together again in the future...I told her that idk what future holds for me and neither does she..It's possible she finds someone or I find someone but for now I want my space , no contact unless I decide to talk to her again....She agreed to it and told me that she is ready wait a whole lifetime if that's how long it takes me to get with her again and that she will wait for me...

We talked about a few things and I told her to leave after. She asked for a last hug, I was reluctant but I didn't want to hurt her more it's not who I am. So I did give her that hug , it lasted longer than before..she sobbed a bit on my shoulder..I finally broke the hug...while doing so she kissed me on the cheek for which she apologised right away...I knew at that moment that it was a bad idea and I need to be nc with her atleast till I am healed...She left the house after that...I honestly felt as if I was able to breathe fresh air and that I was suffocating anymore....

As of now I am really going to focus on myself..heal...try to make new friends(there is this grp in my office who I feel have the same vibe as me, I have talked to them..might befriend a few of them)..

As for the people who suggested I tell Ryan about how few friends knew about Tanya's affair....I had no intentions of calling him..so I emailed him the audio and the summary of the convos and blocked him again.

I‚Äôm going to try to make this short but he is my whole world and truthfully i don‚Äôt have anyone other than him to talk to and sometimes i feel guilty for airing out dirty laundry to the few friends i do have. 
This past weekend my husband had friends over. He did tell me the week prior that he would have people over but he told me it would be 3 people. His dad, brother, and one other friend. On day of (Sunday) he was on the phone with a 4th person who seemed to be talking about the ‚Äúgathering‚Äù which really ended up a party. This 4th person who was not on the original plan, was talking about an additional 5th and 6th person. So now we are up to 6 people. Fine, whatever he‚Äôs allowed to have friends over i don‚Äôt mind. But what i do mind is that one of those so called friends is someone who in the past has taken photos from my facebook, taken my face from them, and put them onto other really nasty images and made fun of me. I voiced to my husband while he was on the phone with subject #4 that i did not want #6 here or anywhere near me and my child. His choice of words was ‚Äúit‚Äôs kind of hard to un-invite someone who‚Äôs already invited‚Äù i asked him to please make it happen or I would be leaving with our child. A couple hours pass by and we wanted some energy drinks so I went to the local coffee shop to grab some. By the time i get home there‚Äôs not even a place for me to park at my own house. So i drive around the block and call him and i ask where i‚Äôm supposed to park, he said he would move his dads truck from the drive. i come back around, it‚Äôs still there and now subject #6 is parked and walking up to our house. So i call him again and i ask him to please grab our son and bring him to my car. Of course he doesn‚Äôt so i parked in the middle of the street and went in the house to get him. My husband then comes up to my car and is trying to prevent me from leaving and at this point i‚Äôm having a full blown panic attack so i just shut my door on him and drove away. 
Circling back, i don‚Äôt really have anywhere else to go so we went to mcdonald‚Äôs and i got us some lunch, bring on a menty b because now i‚Äôm really upset that me and my son are displaced from our home and in a target parking lot eating while i have a mental breakdown and sit there and cry. I turned my phone off so he could not see my location, went home but had to park a street away. I went inside and layed down with my son for his nap. about 45 minutes go by before he realized i was home. He came inside and we started to argue and things got heated mostly because i was able to find my voice and tell him how frustrated and hurt i was. I ended up voicing that i was upset that his dad was even here because his dad only shows up to drink or for hunting stuff, he never asks to see his grand child , never watches him or even asks too. i let that slide when he told me about the plan for him to come over initially but everything else set me off.  That mal #6 never was asked to leave or anything and was here for 6 hours. 
I don‚Äôt feel like i‚Äôm being dramatic but i feel disappointed by him like this a lot. ",1,1739994392.0,AmIOverreacting,5,1.0,False

He said it was a drunken mistake and that they were trying to console each other after their breakups. My initial reaction was actually disbelief as I couldn‚Äôt imagine them hooking up. However I‚Äôd noticed they had good chemistry whenever we all hung out. Then as the day goes on, he reveals one of his other female friends used to be a FWB and another one he‚Äôd liked, kissed but she rejected him. 

What bothers me about all this is that when we first started dating I asked if he had any contact with any exes etc and he said no apart from wishing happy birthday etc. It was important to me because i‚Äôd been cheated on before and he cheated on me with his ex. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair that my boyfriend didn‚Äôt tell me about all these women because we also hang out with them every weekend. He would also have one on one coffee meet ups with one in particular, who I really don‚Äôt like and have always had a bad feeling about, she‚Äôs never tried to be friends with me. 

Anyway I say i‚Äôll think about things over the weekend and get back to him. We meet up and I say i‚Äôm only happy for our relationship to continue if he changes his relationships with these women, stop going one on one dates, no staying around theirs alone after nights out etc. He agrees. 

Anyway a year later he goes back on all these agreements, he slowly starts trying to meet up last minute with this one girl in particular I don‚Äôt like who knows she‚Äôs a problem. She clicks her fingers and he comes running like a little puppy. He says it‚Äôs just the way she is and she demands a lot of attention. He says ‚Äúshe can tell‚Äù I have a problem with her‚Ä¶ and he says this like he‚Äôs trying to guilt trip me. He says i‚Äôm trying to stop him having female friends and I say that‚Äôs not true, he has female friends but a.) he‚Äôs not got a sexual history with them and b.) they‚Äôre cool with me. 

He tells me essentially take it or leave it and that i‚Äôm just jealous and controlling. Am I overreacting? I feel like my feelings are secondary to this girls. ",2,1739994367.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

I built my first computer in September of 2019 and have done a few upgrades here and there swapped out a 1660ti for a 3070, improved the power supply, added an SSD, and more fans but I am looking to get better performance out of it in games with a 1440p display without breaking the bank. 

From what I can tell upgrading the processor would potentially give me the greatest increase in performance, but once I go down that route I would need to upgrade the motherboard to something from a more modern generation. I want to avoid water cooling so I was thinking about a CPU like the Intel Core i5‚Äì13600k, Intel Core i5-14600K, or a Intel Core i7-13700K. as it would allow me to keep using my ddr4 RAM; I was also considering Amd but I am still learning about it. Would upgrading my dd4 ram make a difference or would it not be worth it Performance Wise?



I do not have much experience with the selection of a motherboard and any advice here and reason why you would select the board would be very appreciated, Thank you for your assistance in advance.

- espresso alone has little crema, mostly some bubbles at the surface but no lovely crema. 

- espresso seems very watery.

- used 2 percent milk as it‚Äôs what I had on hand at home, but eventually will use oat milk. 
With 2 percent milk - there was no white foam on a cappuccino, it was more mixed in and again very low foam. 
I did coffee first setting on that.

I‚Äôm using Lavazza Rossa which I just received today but wondering if it‚Äôs the machine or the coffee? I‚Äôm also using factory settings in grinding at moment. Have not tried to change it yet. 

Also - how full do you fill the bean hopper and do you empty the remaining beans left after each usage of machine? If so I will go through a lot of coffee beans. Do you just fill enough for the beverage you intend on making?

Any tips would be welcomed! Love the simple aesthetic (though it‚Äôs massive and takes a lot of room up!). 

Lastly the coffee is very bitter. I usually drink blonde espresso but generally darker roasts still are nice with a milky drink. This is very bitter so maybe the coffee. Was looking for a smooth and low bitterness type blend. If anyone can recommend a better coffee?

**Echoes of a Timeless Love**  
  
I was at the library, engrossed in my work, surrounded by the comforting silence and the soft rustle of pages. My mind was deeply buried in my studies when a familiar figure caught my eye. I looked up and was dumbstruck; there you were, as beautiful as ever, browsing the shelves. My heart skipped a beat, and I couldn't help but stare.  
  
You noticed my gaze and, thinking I was just another creep, you quickly moved away, disappearing behind a row of books. Determined not to let this chance encounter slip away, I stood up and followed you. As I approached, I gathered the courage to speak, ""Hi.""  
  
You turned around, your eyes scanning my face with a hint of confusion. You didn't recognize me; it had been years, and I had changed. The beard and muscles were new, transforming the boy you once knew into someone different.  
  
Still skeptical, you decided to confirm it was me. You reached into your bag, pulled out your phone, and dialed my number. The library's silence was broken by the familiar ringtone of my phone. Your eyes widened in surprise, a mix of disbelief and joy washing over your face. ""Oh my God, it is you!"" you exclaimed.  
  
We laughed, the initial awkwardness melting away. As we walked out of the library, you looked at me in awe and shock, as if to say, ""Is this really you?"" Then, you punched me lightly on the chest and hugged me tightly, whispering, ""Where have you been all this time? No contact, nothing.""  
  
I explained how life had taken unexpected turns, leading to emotional crises despite my financial stability. ""Turns out I was pretty rich,"" I joked, trying to lighten the mood. ""But all the wealth in the world couldn‚Äôt fill the void you left.""  
  
We decided to pack our bags and go for coffee. As we sipped our drinks, I suggested, ""There's a beautiful place with an incredible view. How about we drive there?""  
  
The weather was chilly, with a gentle fog blanketing the surroundings. It felt like we were in a dream, perhaps even in Japan, a place I've always found enchanting. We talked for hours, reminiscing and laughing, the connection between us feeling timeless.  
  
As the evening deepened, I offered, ""Why don‚Äôt you stay at my place? I live alone."" At first, you hesitated, but eventually, you agreed. We spent the entire week together, exploring the city, sharing meals, and talking late into the night. It felt like we were rediscovering each other, every moment more precious than the last.  
  
The day of your departure came too soon. I drove you to the airport, the silence between us heavy with unspoken emotions. As we stood there, I asked, ""So, that's it? Who knows when we'll meet again?""  
  
Your eyes glistened with unshed tears, and you remained silent. The moment felt both heartbreaking and beautiful. I hugged you one last time, slipping a small piece of paper into your hand‚Äîa poem I had written for you.  
  
You boarded the plane, and I watched until you disappeared from view. The poem read:  
  
""In the silence of the night, I find your laughter, Moments we cherished, timeless and bright, Though paths diverged, our love lingers after, In our hearts, where love takes flight.""  
  
As I walked away, I knew our story was far from over. It was just another chapter in the book of us, a tale of love that would continue to unfold, no matter the distance or time.

1itebqe,https://i.redd.it/sy6dab9de5ke1.jpeg,Generation Y (Born 1977 to 1986),"I have defined Generation Y as the U.S. cohort born from 1977 to 1986. This unique microgeneration applies to the youngest members of Generation X (Born 1977 to 1981), and the oldest members of the Millennial Generation (Born 1982 to 1986). Many others have identified this generational cohort as ‚ÄúXennials‚Äù, but I personally feel that Generation Y is the more appropriate designation. One may ask why? Ha ha, get it. My main justification for choosing the name Generation Y for this cohort mainly has to do with historical context regarding the ways Generation X‚Äôs original successional cohort was viewed in the eyes of marketers and the media. 

While it is true that Generation Y, in a modern context, is often synonymous with the Millennial generation, that was not always the case. Firstly, the term ‚ÄúGeneration Y‚Äù was coined by Ad-Age editorial in 1993, to refer to the then teenagers (Born 1974 to 1980). While simplistic peer-group marketing analysis is hardly relevant to this cohort who are now in midlife, it does still speak to a shift in attitudes regarding how social generations were viewed in the early to mid-1990s. But what about the history of the Millennial Generation? Well, the term ‚ÄúMillennial‚Äù was first thought of by authors Neil Howe and William Strauss in 1987, during the early development of what would go on to be known as the Strauss-Howe generational theory. The first time the word was seen on paper was in their 1991 book *Generations*. They defined the Millennial generation as the cohort born between 1982 and 2003. So, obviously, we have two separate concepts here, but it‚Äôs not exactly surprising that they inevitably became intertwined, especially when considering the basics of the alphabet‚ÄîY, of course, follows X. However, looking at this term's origin, it is abundantly clear that it was originally meant to be more of a transitional microgeneration pertaining those born during the waning years of Generation X. But for the purpose of this analysis, I will, of course, include early-Millennials as well.

The start-date (1977) coincides with the first Americans to be born in a new period of rising birth-rates, which indicates to us that they are not a part of the baby bust that Generation X is characterized by. They are not baby busters, but rather, the beginning of a new demographic cohort that many demographers refer to as ‚ÄúEcho-Boomers‚Äù, not only due to the fact that they are statistically lacking in Silent Generation parents, but are, quite literally, a part of a new baby-boom. Note that this ‚Äúboom‚Äù continued until the year 2006, with U.S. birth-rates statistically dropping from 2007 and after, coinciding with the mass social effects that came from the Great Recession. Because of this, it is hard to select an end-date for this cohort that is correlated with birth-rates, as the cohort obviously can‚Äôt continue for another twenty-nine years. This makes the selection process more difficult, but I inevitably decided upon 1986, and will explain why in the next section.

Other cultural markers indicate that those born in 1977 were the first to spend the entirety of their teen years in the 1990s, and they also came of age the year that marked the release of Windows 95, as well the Dotcom Bubble. This is the beginning of a *new* experience, and one that would not have been familiar to most Xers until they were older. This cohorts end-date (1986) coincides with the last children who entered adolescence in the 1990s; the last cohort who entered their childhood in the 1980s; the last who were statistically in school (K-12) before the Disillusionment of Soviet Union; and the last to come of age (reach age of majority) on the verge of Web 2.0 world, reaching adulthood just before the release of **YouTube**. While there are a vast amount of experiences that fall within this nearly ten-year cohort, they are all historically unified, sharing a similar location in history, as they all entered their childhood in the 1980s, spent at least some of their teen-years in the 1990s, and all came of age during the transformative era of Web 1.0.
But what do you think? Am I stretching it? Should the Gen Y concept be abandoned entirely? Make sure to leave a comment down below, and I‚Äôd love to hear what you guys think, thanks.

## Key‚Äå Features‚Äã to Consider ‚Å¢When ‚ÄçChoosing a Handheld Projector for Android

Before considering a handheld‚Äã projector for Android, it's essential‚Äç to understand‚Å£ the‚Å£ key features that differentiate them.

* ‚Å¢  **Brightness (Lumens):** Brightness determines how well the ‚Äçprojector‚Äã performs ‚Äçin different lighting ‚Äåconditions. More lumens ‚Å£mean a brighter image, ‚Å¢making it visible even in rooms ‚Å£with‚Äå some ambient light. For darker environments,a lower lumen count may suffice,but‚Äã for presentations or outdoor ‚Å£use,aim for a higher lumen output. Look for ratings that specify ANSI lumens, which is a‚Å£ more standardized measurement ‚Äçof brightness than ‚Äãsimply ""lumens.""
*   **resolution:** Resolution determines the sharpness and clarity of the image. Higher resolution means more detail and ‚Å¢a more immersive viewing experience. While some projectors support 4K input, the native resolution of the projector itself is what ‚Äçultimately matters. Consider at least 720p (HD) for decent image quality, and 1080p ‚Å£(Full HD) for a sharper picture.
*   **Connectivity:** Ensure the projector has the necessary connectivity ‚Å£options to connect to your Android device.Wireless connectivity (Wi-Fi and Bluetooth)‚Äå is essential for seamless streaming ‚Äçand screen ‚Å£mirroring. HDMI ports allow you to connect to other devices like laptops or gaming consoles. USB‚Å£ ports can be used to play media files directly from a USB ‚Å£drive. The more connectivity options, the more versatile the projector.A projector android hdmi port is ‚Äãa valuable feature.
*   **Battery Life:** Portability is great, but it's useless without adequate battery life. Check the advertised battery life of the projector ‚Å¢and‚Äå read reviews to ‚Å§see if it‚Å§ lives up to‚Å£ the claims. Consider how long you typically need the ‚Äãprojector to run ‚Äãon battery and choose a model ‚Äãthat‚Äã meets your needs. Look for power-saving modes to extend battery life ‚Å£when needed.
* ‚Äã  **Operating System:** ‚ÄãSome ‚Å§handheld projectors come ‚Äçwith a‚Äã built-in Android operating system. This‚Å§ allows you‚Å§ to download and run apps directly on the projector, without the need for an external device.This can‚Äç be ‚Å¢a convenient feature, but it also depends on the quality and performance of the Android system.
*   **Keystone Correction:** Keystone ‚Å§correction is a feature that allows you to correct the image if‚Äç the projector ‚Äåis not positioned perfectly square to the screen. This is especially useful for portable ‚Äçprojectors,as you may not‚Å¢ always have a perfectly flat surface to project onto.Look‚Å¢ for both automatic and ‚Å£manual keystone ‚Å¢correction‚Äå options.
*   **Contrast Ratio:** Contrast ratio refers to the‚Å£ difference between‚Å§ the darkest and brightest parts of‚Å¢ an image. A higher‚Å£ contrast ratio means a more ‚Äçvibrant‚Å¢ and realistic picture.
*   **Weight and Size:** When selecting a portable option,‚Å§ physical dimensions‚Å£ are important. If you're looking for a truly portable projector, make‚Å£ sure it's‚Äç lightweight and ‚Äåcompact enough to carry easily.
*  ‚Äç **Price:** Handheld projector prices vary dramatically depending on the features and performance, so ‚Äåyou should set ‚Å§a budget before you ‚Å£start‚Å§ shopping. consider what features are most important to you ‚Äãand find a projector that‚Äå offers the best ‚Å¢value for your‚Å§ money.
*  ‚Äå **Screen mirroring:** Screen mirroring android projector‚Å¢ capabilities‚Äã allows‚Å§ you to easily project the screen of your Android phone or tablet onto ‚Å£a larger display. Ensure that the projector supports screen mirroring ‚Å£technologies like Miracast or AirPlay ‚Äç(for iPhones).

* ‚Å£  **Use‚Äã a Projector Screen:** Projecting onto a blank ‚Å£white‚Äå wall ‚Å§is ‚Äçokay, but a dedicated projector screen will provide a smoother and more‚Å¢ uniform surface, resulting in a better image quality.
*   ‚Å¢**Adjust Keystone Correction:** Use the keystone correction‚Äç feature to‚Å£ correct any distortions in the image, ensuring it's perfectly square.
*   **Experiment ‚Å§with Projection‚Å§ Distance:**‚Å§ Try different projection distances‚Å£ to ‚Å£find the optimal image size and clarity.
*‚Äç ‚Äã ‚Äå **Consider‚Å§ External Speakers:** While some handheld projectors have decent built-in speakers, using external speakers will provide a more ‚Äåimmersive audio experience.
*   ‚Å¢**Keep Your projector Clean:** dust and debris can accumulate on the lens and affect image quality. Clean the lens regularly with a soft, lint-free cloth.

Finally, a place where we can talk about AI without explaining to our parents that no, our apps won't take over the world... yet. üòâ

I created this community because I was tired of explaining my AI apps to my cat (she's a tough critic, only gives binary feedback - purr or ignore).

Here's what we're all about:
- Sharing cool AI-powered apps (even the ones that hilariously failed - we all know GPT can be quite the comedian sometimes)
- Trading stories about that one time your image generation AI created a cat with three tails and called it ""anatomically correct""
- Learning from each other's successes (and spectacular failures)
- Building awesome stuff together without the fear of someone asking ""but can't you just use an IF statement for that?""

Whether you're a seasoned AI developer or someone who just taught an AI to generate dad jokes (please share those!), you're welcome here.

Rules are in the sidebar, but the main one is: be cool, have fun, and don't let your AI models become self-aware. üòé

I have an upcoming visitation to a school that has admitted me for a five-year STEM PhD program in the states, and am wondering whether I should independently organize coffee chats with current grad students. I haven't received many details on what I will be doing during the visitation beyond meeting potential advisors and a campus tour, so I thought it might be wise to take things into my own hands to make sure that the lab culture is in line with my expectations. I would appreciate some suggestions for the sorts of questions I should be asking.

I am a big fan of the research being done at one of the labs in particular and would really like to accept the offer. However, I have had a pretty jarring experience working under a toxic (borderline demonic) PI in the past so I really want to make sure I am doing my due diligence to make sure the next five (5!) years of life aren't miserable.

What are the norms around organizing meetings with grad students? How open and honest are grad students? Are there questions that might be inappropriate to ask, or questions that I should absolutely ask?

How do I deal with this knowing there's no going back?,"I originally titled this ""I feel I need to break up..."" but I just can't be in denial over this.

I've been dating this girl for about a month and even though we're compatible in a lot of ways I can't see this going long-term. There's just been a lot of turn-offs so far and I just don't feel the sexual attraction to her or feel the chemistry that much. But she's been head over heels for me for the last dates and I feel terrible breaking her heart or that I'll be making a huge mistake that I'll regret if I do break up with her. 

I know there will be no going back if I do this. She was my friends ex I met by chance (who approved of me dating her) and I ended things with her twice in the talking stage over feeling uncomfortable on the ex thing before coming back a third time because we had good chemistry back then. We both agreed I can't mess this up a third time and there's no coming back from it.

Incoming yap about the relationship so far:

We've been through a lot over the past month and even though I had my doubts about her early on before the dates I remember being really excited about her after the first three dates. By the end of the third date I asked her if we were gonna be official and she said it's a bit early for her, and looking back on it it was a bit early for me too. After that date we started having cutesy nicknames for each other.

On the fourth date she said thought about it and agreed we can be boyfriend and girlfriend and I was like cool. Then during that one I noticed she's really not very well-groomed which turned me off sexually and that some of her obsessions are a bit creepy and turning me off. And by the end of that date I just... wasn't be excited to tell people we're official. It felt too much. Then I started having doubts and realizing I might have to break up with her. Especially when a text from a previous toxic situationship that wasn't over me gave me more butterflies than talking with her. 

I was like, I'll give it one more chance because I wasn't sure. And we had a really good date, even though some chemistry wasn't there. But near the end I asked her if she felt it was going too fast and she said it was going perfect for her. And I opened up about how the going official part was too fast for me, and that I'm not comfortable being boyfriend and girlfriend just yet. And I hate feeling like some toxic manipulator saying this shit. She was bummed out but cool with it. But saying that just gave me so much relief. And going home I realized that yeah, this isn't it. I need to end this.

Now I'm setting up meeting her for coffee to end things, and she's texting me cutesy things and it's breaking my heart. I've spent the last hour crying over this. I wish I could have chemistry with her, or break up heartlessly with her. Maybe it's a mistake, maybe it's just traumas from my previous relationships. I feel like if I give her a second chance I'll just feel the same way after the date. I've already talked to friends and told them I'm going to break up with her, so what happens if we don't and they meet?

Any advice would be great :(

If you're new to this like I am, and you're thinking ""nah, I'll hold off on buying the grinder, it'll be fine,"" just... don't. Budget for the grinder too. It's worth it.

This is probably a tale as old as time for this sub, but had to throw it out there anyways in case I can spare anyone else a few months of mediocre espresso. A few months back, I picked up a Breville Bambino, and I dismissed this sub's advice about the grinder being more important than the machine. I thought, sure, maybe for hardcore coffee aficionados who are spending thousands on a machine and exclusively drinking the espresso straight, but how much could it matter if I'm mostly making lattes? I could settle for ""good enough"" when I didn't feel like walking a few blocks to a coffee shop. So I kept my $20 blade grinder and called it a day.

Once the machine came in, I started experimenting, and maybe half the shots I pulled were drinkable, but they would still extract inconsistently and taste off. So I'd throw them in an iced latte and mask the flavor with some syrup, which was... fine. But the annoyance and waste of having to pull multiple shots just to get a barely-passable drink made me eventually accept that this went beyond a skill issue. To confirm that it was truly the grind, I got my typical beans ground by the roaster, took them home, and immediately pulled a bunch of perfect shots with them. At which point, I totally accepted my defeat and ordered an Opus.

It just got delivered today, and... my life is changed. I had to pick my jaw up off the floor when I saw the crema. I'm currently enjoying the espresso straight and it's DELICIOUS, not just tolerable. I can only imagine how much better it'll get once I've dialed it in a little further.

So, for the other newbies out there who are doubting the advice of this sub - it turns out that, yes, you do need a good grinder. Even if you're planning to drink a bunch of sweet flavored lattes and don't care about the taste of the espresso itself, it's honestly still worth it due to the waste you'll be saving yourself with the inconsistency of a blade grinder. It's not worth throwing out half the espresso you buy because the shot totally failed. Don't be like me and end up reflecting on all the shots you've wasted while being stubborn. Budget for the grinder alongside the machine. You're wasting the machine (and the beans) if you don't!",17,1739991848.0,espresso,21,0.82,False

The big city is reputed around the country as one that never sleeps. Especially tonight. Police and an ambulance have gathered by this alleyway. Racket and fussing ensuing, the pitch ink of the frequently passively dispelled by rapid camera flashes.

A stocky, bearded man in blue hobbles to the scene. ""What's going on, people?""

A junior struts to him, ""Captain..."" He points his lanky arms to an oscillating wire below a window. Next to ladders perched up by the force. Higher and higher up, the sight of a bloated foot disgraces his eyes. And creeping shots of the body illumunates in the dark they continue to flash pictures.

""Jesus... You lot found him like that?""

""Yes sir, only in his underwear...""

He burrows his face in his hands. This had been the 12th murder in just 2 months. The same MO: Victim is hoisted by strings and police tape, stripped nude, asphyixiated, legs and arms scabbed to conceal tatoos and birthmarks. Face, teeth, and even crotch mutilated beyond recognizion. Hence, they failed to ID a single victim.

The junior kept staring at the body as the foresnics team cut it down, breathing heavier than usual. ""Its like a...."" He stepped back ""... a lynching...""

""Lynchin of the white man, better be by the white man"" he interrupted with a nasty, soulless grit

""FBI or President Johnson on these lynchings, Captain Graham?""

Graham grunts. ""You can't just call the President, kid, and the BI-""

Suddenley, camera flashes increase in intensity.

""Hacketty fuckin..."" he murmured, as he hobbles ""Goddamn press...""

He transfers from the ruckus of his fellow man to the clamor of the press and civilans. He raises his hand at them with a jovial fashion, not so much as smiling given the context.

""Captain Graham!""

""Graham!""

The flashes becomes rapid. Illuminating the captain's entrance.

""Mr. Graham!""

""The murders Graham! Who's committing the murders?""

""Stuart Graham!""

""Why are the police so calm, Graham Sir?""

He raises his hands forward ""Calm down. I can't take any questions, but make no mistake, we are taking this seriously"" He repositions his hands behind his back. ""I can assure you that this serial *murderer* will be behind bars before kids are out of school.""

""Captain! Captain!"" He recognized this voice. A different junior, shorter, thicker. ""It's Gordon!""

""What""

""It's Deputy Gordon! His badge was bolted to his chest!""

*""WHAT!""*

Graham rushed back to the body, propelling himself with his arms, keeping pace, exhausted in the face of his junior's youthful stamina. It was just as he said, a badge stitched into the victim's chest.

And it's obvious now. The body was stout, short, arms were hairy like a wolf, shards of his black and yellow glasses remained on the disfigured face, and scabs on the right side of his upper back to conceal a rose and Blood Drop Cross tatoo.

With it all, a picture of that boy.

That goddamn boy.

""Deputy Gordon"" murmurs become unignorable to the crowd, and they come to the same realization. A few push deeper into the alley, triggering the rest of the force to block the way.

Graham heaved himself back to the crowd, faster but barely. Out of breath.

""I said no questions.""

As the surrounding camera flashes roar in mass, rapidly banishing the dark. He needs them to leave. Now.

""We will **not** be taking any questions!""

The forensics job ain't for chickens and dastards, to put it simply.

You will see just how easily people can die. You will see the horrid ways people die. You see colors you've never thought would be in a human, and fluids you can't even name. Graham could look at his father and imagine the elderly man he found hanging by a lamppost. He sees his mother and imagines a woman he found choked to death in her own home. By her own husband, foaming at the mouth. He hugs his wife and son and imagines the family of 4 gored and twitching in their cars hours after they were pronounced dead.

It should harden your soul against anyone who would commit such acts. And yet, on August 28, 1955, he happened on a black teen boy shot through the head, who's face decomposed beyond recognition to the point he could only be recognized when his own mother came onto the scene, screaming and bawling.

The worst day in her life was his tuesday. He went through the motions, determined what killed him, and more importantly who...

Roy Milam was a friend. A good friend. And a like-minded man. about 9 years his junior. He had a wife and sons to take care of...

Graham and Deputy Gordon decided to rule the death of Emmett Woodward a suicide. When that didn't work, a like-minded police force and a like-minded jury decided to acquit Roy and his accomplices, these like-minded men and their wives...

Then the fool bragged about it on the newspaper a year later.

That's all he cared to think. Not a murderer, not a liar, not *racist*. Just a fool...

And now that fool is dead. Along with Gordon. And he's left to assume the unrecognizable corpses are his missing coworkers.

Issac's picture was filed under evidence and the press will never discover it. They wont make a conncection. But it was chilling. Graham knew he was next.

As he tried to rest, he felt a pair of eyes on him. It's gotten harder and harder for Graham to sleep as he aged but the aura felt malicious. Spiteful. Vindicted...

#<BANG>
- - -
Thunder struck by the musuem at his window, and a caught a glimpse of **Him**. A dark, shilloute of a body and thick, half circled white visor. Hanging by his window. Graham sprung up with his pistol pointing at the window, an in that instant, He was gone...

Graham never witnessed death in motion. Only the aftermath. It's easier to see a body than a screaming, eyeless citizen or a faceless woman right after a car crash. He's never seen a murderer in action, only in chains and in court. So naturally he struggles to keep himself composed under threat. His panting least of all.

# <CLANG>
- - -
He turns by his kitchen window to he **Him** again, with all four of his extremities stuck to the glass. Watching. Breathing.

# <PANG>
- - -
And then **He** was gone...

Poor Graham's bony wrists enabled a clanking as he struggled to hold his gun still. He know what **He** was capable of. Everyone in the city knew what **He** was capable of, but never in his wildest dreams did he think he'd see any law abiding, like-minded men such as himself suffer the same fate.

He ran out the apartment complex to face the intruder head on, completeley and utterly exhausted by the time he makes it out, he colllapses, and sobs softly. He scanned the alleyway as best as he knew his coworkers would, but couldn't find **Him**. He shook, shivered, and buckled. Until he looked up.

# <BANG>
- - -
The Tarantula...

A young man. A human man in pitch black spandex, yet concealed so perfectly in the shadow that all Graham could truly see were a pair of white, beady visors. His extremeties stuck back into the alley wall like a spider, cloaked like a bat, hiding in the night with a vengeance.

""You know why I'm here"" he spoke as an icy groan.

He did. He didn't dare speak.

""But answer me one question"" he unglued himself from the wall and stepped slightly closer, flexing a youthful, muscular gait. ""What was so different about Emmett?""

He kept silent.

""It's the 60s man!"" He sung with a dissident tone ""It's the future! What made Emmett different, Stuart?""

""He- he... he was...""

""He was *what* Stuart?""

""Wa... wa-was a...""

""Can't even say it...""

The controdictary, human youth, stepped closer, a bit sideways towards the forensics captain. Slow enough to preserve the moment but fast enough so Graham understood his end was coming.

""Underneath this suit is a darker, darkness... A proud darkness. The kind of darkness you hate...""

He shivered profoundly.

""It may be a radiocative speck in your morning coffee... a slow death, from painful, facial necrosis... Or a misstep into an empty express elevator shaft... Maybe an electrical fire, while you're sleeping...""

The disparate, youthful man rubbed Graham's shoulders.

""Or I can kill you like the others... I promise I'll find a fitting end for you Stuart...""

# <PANG>
- - -
In what felt like an instant, the strange, human man leaped back into the alleyway, throwing a strange gadget into the wall which propelled him even further up, then out into the streets. With a swiftness and almost alient gymastic finess...

1itdh9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pottery/comments/1itdh9j/i_need_an_opinion_on_vending/,I need an opinion on vending,"Hi all. I am a hobby potter and have been at it hard for almost a year now. I don't sell my work currently, but I do love gift giving. A friend of mine owns a local coffee show and also knows I have tons of backlog that I don't know what to do with. She asked if I would like to sell at a market. 

To clarify, I don't really care to make money off of my pottery, at least not at this stage, and I do give people important info about food safety (a little short email guide about leaching, crazing, important things to look out for) if I am gifting dinnerware.

I am thinking of participating in the vending event, but with a ""pay what you want"" caveat. I like this idea because I get to share my art with people, and keep it accessible. I don't care about profit, and I want anyone who wants something to have it. On the other hand though, I know this can be quite the taboo in the ceramics world (selling after less than a year, that is). I feel like my skills have quite clearly developed, but I am not a professional, and I know that there is a lot more for me to learn from this craft. 

I guess I would like to hear from some more veteran artists on this. My focus is to participate, and to meet people and other artists, to have fun and share my work (and maybe put the funds I do leave with back into my hobby), but I know it can be a pretty slippery slope as well. If this is a bad idea, I am open to any critique. I want to view it as an learning opportunity, but I am nervous about if selling is a bad move/taboo, and if so, why? I have a weird feeling which is why I am asking, but I also really do look forward to giving this a try some day, at least. ",7,1739991656.0,Pottery,10,1.0,False

My wife (40F) and I (41M) have been married for 10 years, dated for 10 years before that. Dating since college. We used to have a pretty decent sex life in the past, not like every day but it was often enough to keep both of us happy - she used to be ML and I have always been HL.

Fast forward to now - 10 years since we've had sex. Thing is, we love each other. She cuddles, we massage each other, we kiss (but not passionately) and overall - it's not like we dislike each other, hell we even have showers together.

But she just doesn't seem interested in sex anymore - whenever the possibility comes up, she finds a way to navigate out of it - sometimes by bringing up a topic randomly to talk about, or other ways. She's not mean to me - it's just...she and I end up arguing when we try and have a genuine conversation about this.

But I've never felt so sad and empty as I have just a couple of nights ago. We went away to stay in a boutique hotel that she had been looking at and it was a really romantic suite - real rose petals on the bed when we got into the room, a heart shaped jacuzzi. But....no sexual intimacy all weekend. Aside from cuddling, light kissing and getting into the jacuzzi together, where nothing happened except her ""relaxing"", closing her eyes or just wanting to chat and nothing more.

The worst, lowest point for me though - was the night before our checkout date and the morning of our checkout date. We unfortunatley had some very rambunctious neighbours in the suite next to us - and thin walls. During the night, they were going at it like rabbits and my wife just shook her head with a rolling eyes look on her face and asked us to move to the couch area away from the wall where we could easily hear that other couple and we just watched a movie together. Then in the morning, she got up early to grab a coffee and I got woken up to the neighbours going at it again, and despite me trying to ignore it all I could hear was the serious passion and moaning from the other side of the wall. 20 minutes of it - and I could hear the woman hitting some peaks at least a couple of times, they were very vocal and it was obvious, wasn't like in a porn or something - sounded genuine. (Before people tell me I was being voyeuristic, I genuinely couldn't ignore it - no matter where I went in the room, it was fully audible - very thin walls as I said - hell MY bed was vibrating from their shenanigans¬†*through the wall*). By the time my wife came back, they had already finished so she didn't experience any of it. I finished getting ready to leave, packed our stuff up and I was super sullen and she asked me what's wrong - and I explained how I was genuinely getting those pings of pain in my chest from the deep sadness hearing another couple just expressing themselves like that and us not having sex for 10 years. My wife just giggled and said ""we're not animals, let it go"" and that was the end of the discussion. Since then, she won't even have a conversation about sex.

I get that this is more than most people on this subreddit have with their SOs, so I apologize if there's already people who ready to tell me that I don't have it that bad. But I want to get back to the place when we were at least having sex 1 or 2 times a week. Hell I'd take once a month at this point. Just feeling pretty hopeless. There's no way I'd leave her because aside from this - I know this is a great relationship in every other aspect - she is incredibly thoughtful about everything else in our lives.

This is my first time shopping for extension springs, so I didn't really know much about them, except that they do what they do... I just assumed you'd go to Home Depot and there would be a huge bay of springs somewhere and you could find the one you needed, lol.  

Well, at least in my case, the HD near me only had like a few packs of Everbilt springs that didn't match what I needed, so I went to Ace.  They have an entire wall of springs from various brands in different sizes and colors and shapes and hooks, so I was like ""clearly this is what I need.""

Nope.

There were some that were pretty close, but still >1/4"" off in length, fewer coils, etc.

Am I screwed? Or can I use a longer spring? 

(I've also measured its length and diameter in inches and centimeters, and counted the number of coils, and searched on Amazon/Google, to no avail... It looks like the coil is about 3.5"", and the hooks are 0.75"" each, so 5"" total length, with ~0.75"" diameter)",1,1739991304.0,DIY,2,0.67,False

We don‚Äôt know much about your origins. Like many Podencos in Spain, you probably belonged to a hunter and spent your days hunting in a pack‚Äîuntil one day, you chose your own path.

Life on your own was tough, but you never gave up. At some point, you found shelter with an old man who kept dogs in makeshift kennels. Apparently, you were there for almost a year. How did you fare? We don‚Äôt know.

But when you finally moved in with us, it quickly became clear: you had never had such a comfortable bed before! You loved it‚Äîsoft and warm. Soon, you showed us how much at home you felt: sleeping on your back, woofing, growling, and running in your dreams. Every evening, you sprinted to your little bed on command to get your bedtime treat.

Then you stretched out your paws wide‚Äîthey smelled so good, especially in summer. Their scent brought pure happiness, better than the aroma of fresh coffee beans. Just like the crunch of a carrot, the crispness of your little treats, the sloshing of water‚Ä¶ it was a joy to listen to you. What must it have sounded like when you secretly devoured pear bread, bread rolls, and pizza all on your own?

You were an ambitious hunter. Annoying flies didn‚Äôt stand a chance against your lightning-fast reflexes. Mice, lizards, and of course, your beloved treats‚Äîall caught in a flash. Cats had to escape into trees while you tirelessly patrolled the garden in Spain. For hours, you hunted, dug, and sniffed on the fields‚Äîso focused that nothing could distract you. Your greatest joy? Your beloved ball! You even jumped into the water for it.

But playing with other dogs? No interest. At most, a quick exchange of greetings. Cuddling with humans? Only if absolutely necessary. But belly rubs and scratches behind the ears? Those were fantastic‚Äîkeep going!

We are so grateful for every single day you spent with us as our loyal companion‚Äîthrough the meadows and forests of the Zurich spring, summers in Spain, autumns in Ticino, and winters in Berg√ºn.

We hope we have prepared you well for the journey ahead. Search, search, search. You will find happiness. And we will miss you forever. ‚ù§Ô∏èüêæ

Post MBBS intern in their late 20s here....

I was a middle class kid, Late Millenial-early Gen Z , who attended a private CBSE school for class 1 to 12, with no attached coaching centre.

The education system being what it was, [and probably still is]....one can just guess how the quality of teachers in private CBSE schools was in the early 2010s.

Like most of my classmates in science stream, I too used to go for evening Tuitions from 9th to 12th, not only because our school classes sucked, But for the following added reasons:

1)Hearsay that ""it somehow makes students better and improves marks and performance"", 

2)""My parents were convinced by other like minded parents"",

3)""Not going for tuition? Opting for self study? voh 4 log kya kahenge?""

4)""Less marks? Not going for tuition? Yahi toh dikhat Hai!!""

Cut to the mid 2010s, I managed to crack State CET [there was no Single National Entrance like NEET at that time, just AIPMT for all india seats and State CETs for state quota seats], and got into a GMC in my home state.

Academically, the 5.5 years are highly challenging for everyone, But they were a special kind of torture for those of us who used to go for Tuitions in school.
Reasons?

1)No spoon feeding in MBBS [had to hit the OG books hard and churn out info..and initially didnt know where to read from......remember  those goddamn Cunninghams volumes?!].
 
2)No personal attention or help with doubts [we all know how scary it was to go and ask profus doubts, only to be severely reprimanded for some non related issue]

3)No concise material[available at the time]......[hardly any youtube vids on the course at that time, let alone coaching apps]

4)No Notemaking/Textbook Reading habit [used to be dependant on tuition notes and concise material, never read through full volumes of texts, never needed more coffee and power naps in my entire life]

5)No practice paying attention in morning lectures [used to pull a ""Windows 99 style shut down"" of my brain in school only to ""Windows Start"" it in evening classes]

6)No practice of independently going through previous papers and making short/long note lists or narrowing down to the ""MUST KNOWS"" [used to depend on readymade PYQ list from tuition and tuition tests.....more coffee, power naps...... now spectacles?]

Not to mention the gargantuan syllabus and numerous textbooks [one more cause of persistent, inconsolable crying....other than DPT I.e]

Of course, I've nothing against coaching, in modern times where there's cut throat competition in entrance exams, it's important to fully understand concepts and practice their application in a guided manner and im not even again those who crack them without coaching.

And I've thoroughly enjoyed the non academic aspects of MBBS...I.e. The college life, festivals, parties etc.......#NotAfFrusto


Just salty about having had to go for tuitions and the side effects they wrought.


 I'm glad about the post 2019 MBBS syllabus change[CBME] and the accompanying info boom....MBBS students now have access to readily available info more than ever before.....youtube vids, coaching apps, concise textbooks, etc.

I am looking to hear people‚Äôs caffeine withdrawal stories? What was the timeline of your recovery? What symptoms did you experience? And what helped you get through it? Can you experience moderate-severe withdrawal symptoms from even cutting down a cup or 2 (weening?)

About 2 weeks ago, I landed in the hospital due to a reaction to MSG. Those symptoms gave me blurry vision, a racing heart, high BP, etc. so I decided to cut down my coffee consumption to 1 cup. Most days I have the equivalent of 2-3 and I‚Äôve been doing so for many years. My symptoms weren‚Äôt improving and I was worried I fried my nervous system via glutamate excitotoxicity. I also have fibromyalgia and I guess that leads to high glutamate as well. I went back to the hospital several nights later and went several days without having coffee due feeling very unwell. I‚Äôm still waiting to see a specialist and hoping to rule out any other neurological issues.

I‚Äôve been experiencing a light dizziness, blurry vision, feeling incredibly overstimulated, sensitive to light and noise, sore, tingling in my limbs, feeling like my brain is wired and getting brain zaps, insomnia, and the most intense anxiety and panic attacks and impending doom feeling which I‚Äôve never experienced in the past. I also can‚Äôt stop crying throughout the day. 

Today I had 1 cup and it took away some of the blurry vision and some of my soreness. I haven‚Äôt had a panic attack yet. But my brain feels like its rapid firing. I think the coffee is taking away some of the effects but also adding to the stimulation. I‚Äôm thinking atleast some, if not all, of my residual symptoms could be due to caffeine withdrawal. 

Has anyone experienced this level of intensity when even cutting down just 1 cup? After experiencing these feelings, I want to gradually taper so I never have to experience this again.

Each day saw insatiable hunts for locro de papa [bright yellow potato soup] with chicha morada [purple corn drink], but food wasn‚Äôt always so easy to find.
 
Then desert backroads across north Peru where sunkissed canyons skyrocketed beyond 16,000ft [4,968m] in Huayhuash y la Cordillera Blanca. Morning camp coffee was often the best part of my day, or momentary stops for sweet, sticky alfajores [traditional Latin American sandwich cookies].
 
When I look back on those roads now, my instinctual response is choked in trauma. ‚ÄúNo way, I could never,‚Äù as if forcibly forgetting each cruel bend in the gravel. It‚Äôs been perhaps the most beautiful part of the journey from Alaska to Argentina thus far, but also the most backbreakingly difficult. You reach your physical and emotional capacity by 5pm each day, yet have no choice but to throw yourself past it week after week for months without letup. Your body crumbles over and over, but there‚Äôs nowhere to escape to and no way to get there.
 
From up above the clouds, each payoff remains breathtaking. Camp colors, indelible. Ahead lie Bolivia, Chile and Argentina still. It just might take some time to come down.
 
‚ÄúFor beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror
which we are barely able to endure, and it amazes us so, because it serenely disdains to destroy us.‚Äù - Rainer Maria Rilke",24,1739990553.0,xbiking,1,0.96,False

The older I get the more I want to randomly yap.,"You kind of get to that older in life age and everyone you knew kind of are just doing their own thing. You tell them you have Friday and Saturday off and they tell you they have Monday and Wednesday off so you find that 30 second window to get together for a drink before cracking back at it. You reach that certain kind of stability where you still want to talk about the random stuff through the day with someone and they do the same. Ya miss them when it's quiet but then you realize you have your own life to live too. That's where I'm at. Still wanting to randomly talk... just nobody really to talk to! So figured I'd give this a whirl!

  
Little bit about me. I'm old and ugly with a big ol beard that constantly smells like coffee or cigars (not in an offensive way at least). Full time job with all the bells and whistles but thankfully I have a lot of days off! Been around the world when I was young and it was actually affordable to do so so always have a love to hear about and share cultures. Can tell you a little bit about each countries jail at least when I was picked up for a night for a random bar fight or breaking stupid laws. I used to love to cook but now I just want the cheap and easy so tell me of your favorite fast foods and frozen meals since I'm trying to try them all now and I'll tell you some nice recipes or pairs in return! I've never owned a microwave but am considering getting one. For nearly 20 years I've made my own soap and toothpaste and deodorant and cologne/etc but now... again... cheap and easy route but still know how to make everything. In the USA, woohoo Indiana!

1itd01u,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1itd01u/stuck_on_channeling_bambino_non_plus/,Stuck on channeling [Bambino non plus],"I bought a bottomless portafilter to diagnose my shots. I am confident to say I am able to get tasty shots now. However I still can't get rid of channeling and sprtizing. I have df54 and bambino non plus.

Workflow: rdt then use wdt tool making sure I reach the bottom. Then tap on the table to settle a bit then tamp.

I have tried adjusting every variable I can. I stared with 15g. Grind finer each time until the shot is clogged and can no longer flow, but still having channeling. Then dose lower, shots run fast then grind finer until clogged. I reached 13g and beyond that I can no longer tamp properly because of the slope on the basket.

And then I went the otherway. Increase the dose.It clogs then I grind a bit coarser, until I reach about 18g, and beyond that the grounds overflow and it's hard to tamp properly without have to tap on the table multiple times. When I have to tap multiple times, it doesn't matter how much I try to keep it straigt while tapping down, the grounds are getting pushed to one side.

I have been getting tasty shots where I can finally drink it and actually enjoy it. I have never enjoyed espresso shot alone in any coffee shop before, whether small local shops or big commercial ones.

I just want to get rid of channeling. I have dark roast beans. I'm not sure about the roast date but I buy them from a local espresso shop, but I'm pretty sure they don't have stale beans as they taste good and there is a good bloom when I do pour overs.

I've already used up a pound of beans and still getting channeling. I take breaks from making shots to let the machine cool down a bit, because the bambino get's too hot after multiple shots.",1,1739990531.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

1itcxwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/step1/comments/1itcxwz/passed/,Passed,"My tips for the test takers

1. The questions are between Uworld and NBMEs in style and length

2. Some questions are direct memory ones whereas other requires thinking. For the latter it means that it may not be something you‚Äôve studied directly but may be around the topic. That‚Äôs why the exam is truly a test to see if someone is rote learning/last minute memorization vs have put in the hard yards and really dived into the content to try to understand

3. The first 10 questions in my exam were really difficult for me. But before I went into the exam I told myself that there will be a point in the exam where it will get really hard, everything will fall apart and when it happens I have to ride it. For me it was the first 10 questions. I genuinely thought I was screwed and didn‚Äôt know the material. But as the questions progressed it got a lot better. Some questions are curve balls and the best thing is to give it the minute, flag and move on

4. Timing wise I finished each block with around 11 mins left. I reviewed the flagged questions and unflagged as I reviewed them. Once it was a final answer regardless of whether I knew it or not I unflagged it because at some point you have to go with an answer. If there was time remaining I then re reviewed the unflagged questions 

5. For ethics there are a few questions per block. Learn the basic material from Uworld and MUST read the first aid section as a few questions and scenarios are very similar to that. The ethics questions can be based on a simple topic but weirdly asked so I think it‚Äôs helpful to not study ethics last minute, but 20 mins a day at the end of each day with a study buddy and discuss in a fun random way how they could possibly ask about this point 

6. Stats does come up and is easy marks do not neglect

7. NBME concepts are useful for sure so I would recommend reviewing them. If you‚Äôre good with timing for the exam I suggest doing one block of NBME (50 questions) each day rather than the whole exam because it can become hard to review whereas one block is doable and more enjoyable. Can still do it in timed conditions. Of course continue first aid and Uworld. My nbme ranged from 70-80% 

8. On exam day. I took a break after each block because my mind needed a fresh start for each block. Honestly even 5 mins is amazing. I had a bottle of coffee in the locker which I sipped and helped. For food I ate nuts because it was high energy without the bloating. Drank a lot of water and needed to pee in each break.

Any questions feel free to ask.",13,1739990394.0,step1,5,0.94,False

1itcvsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1itcvsn/message_from_the_void/,Message from The Void,"Let me start from the beginning.¬†¬†

That Monday started out like any other. I arrived at work, filled my coffee cup and stepped into my office. I'm a former Air Force Major, now in training with NASA for a spot on the ISS. If all went according to plan, I should have been heading up there within the next year or so. But you know what they say, ‚ÄúMan plans, and God laughs.‚Äù¬†¬†

As I sat down to look over the files on my desk, my phone rang. I was informed that I had a meeting in the conference room down the hall.¬†

‚ÄúA meeting? I don't have anything on my schedule, who is it with?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúHe didn't give a name; just said it was urgent. You better hurry, he doesn't seem the patient type.‚Äù¬†

That didn't sound good. I hung up the phone and left my office, feeling anxious. What could this be about? I thought.¬†

I stepped into the conference room to see a man in a black suit seated at the oval shaped table. He was a small man, but seemed to have a commanding presence. He had sharp eyes behind round glasses, and held a yellow file folder trimmed with black and red.¬†¬†

He stood as I entered, ‚ÄúMajor Royce.‚Äù He said shaking my hand.¬†

‚ÄúSir.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúHave a seat.‚Äù He said motioning to the chair across from his, ‚ÄúWe have some things to discuss.‚Äù¬†

I sat, and waited. But the man said nothing, he just sat across from me, studying me for a solid minute.¬†¬†

I cleared my throat, ‚ÄúUh, what's this about?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing exceedingly well in your training.‚Äù He said, as he continued studying me, ‚ÄúI understand you will be going up to the ISS soon. Are you looking forward to taking your place among the stars?‚Äù¬†

I sat up a bit straighter, ‚ÄúYes sir, I should be completing my training within the year. After that, it's just a matter of waiting for crew rotation.‚Äù¬†

The man nodded, ‚ÄúIt's an amazing achievement, I'm sure your family is very proud.‚Äù¬†¬†

I smiled, but my smile quickly faltered under the man's lizard like stare. I had yet to see him blink as he silently studied me.¬†

‚ÄúHow would you like to go sooner?‚Äù He said without breaking his gaze.¬†

‚ÄúSooner? I'm not sure I follow sir. Are you saying I could go up before crew rotation?‚Äù I asked¬†

‚ÄúNo, I mean much sooner... And, you wouldn't be going to the ISS.‚Äù¬†

I blinked in confusion, ‚ÄúWait, are you saying there‚Äôs another mission planned? Since when? And to where?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt's being planned as we speak.‚Äù He said as he placed his hand atop the seal on the file folder, ‚ÄúSo I take it you‚Äôre interested?‚Äù¬†

I nodded, ‚ÄúYes, I am.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúGood. But before I outline the mission, I need to know you're on board. The information in this file is... Sensitive.‚Äù He said cryptically.¬†

I hesitated; this situation seemed unusual. ‚ÄúI need to know some details before I make my decision.‚Äù¬†

The man drummed his fingers on the file, ‚ÄúNo. I'm afraid this is a time sensitive issue. If you aren't up for the task, we will have to move on to the next candidate.‚Äù¬†

Now it was my turn to study him. He‚Äôd make one hell of a poker player. I thought. His cold calculating eyes gave nothing away. I didn't like him but dammit was I curious. After all, this was what I wanted wasn't it? I joined the military and then NASA in search of adventure. I'm sure there would still be a spot on me on the ISS in the future.¬†

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI'm in.‚Äù¬†

There was the smallest of grins on the man's face as he broke the seal on the file. ‚ÄúExcellent.‚Äù¬†

He opened the folder and removed a few sheets of paper before handing them over. They were pretty standard government NDAs, nothing I hadn't seen before.¬†

‚ÄúSo, CIA?‚Äù I asked.¬†¬†

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù he said. There wasn't quite a scoff, but I could imagine it.¬†

I signed the NDA paperwork and slid it across to him, ‚ÄúSo, who are you?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou can call me Neilan.‚Äù He said as he took the paperwork and looked it over. ‚ÄúI'm with an organization called the Bureau of Anomalous Research and Defense, or B.A.R.D. You won't have heard of us and don't bother trying to look us up, no one else has either.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThe B.A.R.D.?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúAnd what exactly do you research? Little green men?‚Äù¬†¬†

He almost smiled, ‚ÄúWe investigate various phenomena, both foreign and domestic. However, all you are privy to is what's in this file.‚Äù¬†

He removed more documents from the file and passed them over to me. There were schematics, mission statements and crew information. I scanned over the schematic, it was a massive research station, easily ten times the size of the ISS. From an engineering standpoint it was extremely impressive. Multiple labs, a common room and quarters for a dozen crew. It was designed to rotate on a central axis, using this rotational force or centrifugal force the station could simulate something close to earth gravity. It looked like something straight out of a sci fi movie.¬†

‚ÄúThis is an extremely ambitious project.‚Äù I said.¬†

‚ÄúYes. It was.‚Äù¬†

I looked up at him, ‚ÄúWas? You mean we have this?‚Äù¬†

Neilan nodded, ‚ÄúThe Icarus 1 has been in orbit for the past five years.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThe Icarus 1?‚Äù I asked, ‚ÄúDidn't Icarus fly too close to the sun?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYes, well I didn't choose the name. Although there is something to be said about self-fulfilling prophesies.‚Äù He said leaning back in his chair.¬†

I squinted at him, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that supposed to mean?‚Äù¬†

He sat there silently for a moment, then said. ‚Äú19 hours ago, the Icarus was hit by a massive solar storm. It was completely unexpected and knocked out all communications with the station.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúShit.‚Äù I said.¬†

‚ÄúIndeed.‚Äù He said folding his hands on the table, ‚ÄúWe don't know what other systems might have been affected by the storm. Our scientists may not even be alive or if they are how much longer they have, hence the urgency. We need you to get to the station as soon as possible and bring our people home. And in the event that the crew is lost to us, we need you to retrieve the research data and any viable test samples.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat kind of test samples?‚Äù I asked as I looked over the crew files. The crew was consisted mostly of scientists, and a few engineers.¬†

Neilan drummed his fingers again. ‚ÄúIt is our hope that the crew is still alive. In the event that they are not, you will be briefed on the samples and data we need retrieved.‚Äù¬†

I looked up at him, trying to read his expression. The man truly was unreadable. I looked back to the crew file, one in particular stood out. The man held multiple degrees across several fields including astro physics, molecular biology, and of all thing's zoology.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWho is this Dr. Stromm?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs our lead scientist on the station. Anything beyond that is not covered under your current NDA.‚Äù Said Neilan.¬†

¬†

I nodded, ‚ÄúOkay, when do we launch?‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúThere is no we, Major Royce. You are going up alone, and you launch first thing tomorrow.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I exclaimed, standing up from my chair. ‚ÄúAre you insane? I need time to prepare, we need to run tests on the shuttle, you can't launch a mission on such short notice.‚Äù¬†

Neilan stayed sitting, ‚ÄúMajor, we have taken all necessary precautions; we prepare for these eventualities. Normally we have a pilot on standby but unforeseen circumstances have rendered them currently unavailable.‚Äù¬†

I shook my head, ‚ÄúI don't know about this.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThis launch is happening tomorrow, if you‚Äôre not the man for the job...‚Äù¬†

I put up my hands, ‚ÄúNo. No, I can do it.‚Äù¬†¬†

Neilan stood and shook my hand, ‚ÄúGood, we‚Äôre counting on you, those people up there are counting on you. Don't let us down.‚Äù And with that, he left.¬†¬†¬†

What was I doing? These missions typically up to two years to prepare for, and I was expected to go in less than 24 hours.¬†

¬†

¬†Needless to say, I didn't sleep much that night. As I lay there in bed, thinking over the insanity of what I was about to do, I grabbed my phone and scrolled through my downloaded music. I smiled when I found what I was looking for and pushed play. As the strumming guitar began to flow from the speakers in my room, I felt my stress begin to melt away. My lips formed the words automatically along with the chorus, ‚ÄúTheres a Starman waiting in the sky, he‚Äôd like to come and meet us but he thinks he‚Äôd blow our minds.‚Äù I remember listening to it when I was a kid, staring up at the stars in night sky and thinking that someday, I'd get up there. That someday, I'd be a Starman.¬†

¬†

The shuttle they had prepared was like nothing I had ever seen before. It was smaller and sleeker than the typical shuttles that NASA uses. I found myself wondering, what else the B.A.R.D. had hidden away from the world.¬†¬†

¬†Once I was suited up, Neilan met me before heading out to the launch pad.¬†

‚ÄúMajor Royce. I want to thank you for service to this great nation.‚Äù He said as he saluted.¬†

I returned the gesture.¬†

¬†‚ÄúWe will be with you on comms and your helmet is wired with a video feed. Again, if there are no survivors, we will give you further instructions.‚Äù¬†

I nodded, ‚ÄúYou can count on me sir.‚Äù¬†

My heart was pounding as I made my way down the walkway to the shuttle hatch, I couldn't believe this was actually happening. This launch wasn't strictly official, it would never be in history books or documented in any way beyond a sealed file folder marked classified, but I didn't care. I was finally headed for the stars.¬†

I settled into my seat and strapped in, running my fingers over the control panels. I snapped my helmet into place, hearing the seals hiss as they pressurized. As I stared up into the cloudless blue of the morning sky, I swelled with pride, thinking of the heroes that have gone before me.¬†¬†

‚Äú10, 9, 8,‚Äù The countdown sounded over the shuttle comms, ‚Äú7,6,5,4,‚Äù, My heart pounded as adrenaline began to flow. ‚Äú3,2,1,‚Äù The thrusters fired, the shuttle trembled as it began to lift and soar upwards. G forces pinned me to my seat as the rocket tore its way through the atmosphere, the blue of the sky turned darker and darker until it finally faded to black and the stars popped and shined with a clarity unlike anything I'd ever seen. As my shuttle left the grip of the earth's atmosphere, the rocket boosters detached and fell away.¬†¬†

‚ÄúHow's it looking up there Major?‚Äù asked Harry, the comms officer.¬†

‚ÄúEverything looks good from up here, command. How we looking on your end?‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúRoger that. All systems show green down here. How's that view?¬†

I looked around in awe that I was finally here, ‚ÄúIts beautiful Harry, you gotta see it someday.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúMajor.‚Äù Said Neilan, ‚ÄúProceed on course to the Icarus.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCopy. Proceeding on course.‚Äù¬†

¬†

The Icarus 1 loomed large and foreboding in the darkness of space. I had been concerned about attempting to dock onto the rotating station, but as I approached, I could see that more than just the comms systems had been knocked out.¬†

‚ÄúCommand. Looks like the station is completely dark. I'm seeing no signs of power from here.‚Äù I said.¬†

‚ÄúCopy.‚Äù Came Harrys voice, ‚ÄúContinue to station and commence docking procedure.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCopy, commencing docking.‚Äù¬†

I took a steading breath as I brought the shuttle into position. I had done this countless times in simulations with a 99.8% success rate. As the docking hatch came closer and closer, that .2% burned in my mind. Fortunately, the controls on the B.A.R.D. shuttle were smoother than I could have wished for. I sighed in relief as the docking hatch slid into place with a satisfying clank.¬†

‚ÄúShuttle docked. Preparing to enter station.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúRoger that Major, proceed with caution.‚Äù¬†

The airlocks hissed as I unlocked the hatch door to the Icarus. The entry into the station was like a dark portal into the abyss. I activated my helmets lamps as I floated through the passage.¬†¬†

‚ÄúCommand. I'm inside, the station is completely dark.‚Äù I said.¬†

‚ÄúCopy that. There should be an access terminal on the wall next to the hatch entry way.‚Äù Said Harry.¬†

I turned around until I found the terminal and floated over to it. Tapping the keyboard activated the system. I quickly found the lighting controls and switched them on. The lights in the corridor flickered to life, illuminating the white sterile hallway walls and floors. The readings on the terminal showed that the communication systems and the centrifugal engines were offline.¬†¬†

‚ÄúRoyce, the offline systems can't be accessed from that computer. You'll need to get to the engine room and the communications deck to assess what damage has been done.‚Äù Said Harry.¬†

‚ÄúDisregard that Major.‚Äù Interrupted Neilan. ‚ÄúSearch the station for the crew. Their survival and the recovery of our data is the priority here.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCopy that.‚Äù I said as I pushed off the wall and glided down the hallway.¬†

The station was eerily silent. After searching through the crew cabins and the botany lab, I made my way into the common area. There was no sign of the dozen crew members to be found. Where could they have gone? I exited the common area and was about to enter the neighboring room when I thought I heard a voice coming from down the hall.¬†

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I called out. ‚ÄúIs someone there?‚Äù¬†

A man floated out of a room at the end of the hallway, ‚ÄúHello.‚Äù He said as he began slowly gliding towards me.¬†¬†

As he got closer, I recognized him, ‚ÄúDr Stromm. I'm Major Royce. I was sent up here to bring you all home.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHome? He questioned. ‚ÄúBack to earth?‚Äù¬†

As he approached, I realized he looked different from the photo in his file. His skin was gaunt and had almost a purplish tint to it and his proportions seemed just a bit off, not by a lot but just enough to look strange. His head seemed a bit more bulbous than in the picture and his extremities seemed a little too long for the jumpsuit he was wearing.¬†

‚ÄúUm. Yes home.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúWhere are the others?‚Äù¬†

Stromm turned his head side to side, as if glancing around for his crew. ‚ÄúI'm... I'm not quite sure. They should be here, they were here.‚Äù¬†

As he turned, I could see a small bandage covering his right ear.¬†¬†

‚ÄúDr. Stromm, are you hurt?"" I asked.¬†

He looked at me, his bloodshot eyes filled with confusion, ‚ÄúHurt? Yes. Yes, I was hurt. But I'm alright now. I'd like to go home.‚Äù¬†

I nodded, ‚ÄúOf course. I'll get you home, we just have to find the others first.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThe others?‚Äù He asked cocking his head to the side, ‚ÄúOh, they won't be joining us. No... No, they won't. Well, yes, they will, just not like they were.‚Äù He laughed. ‚ÄúForgive me Major, I'm not quite sure what I'm saying.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThats fine. Let's just check that injury, then we‚Äôll find the others and get you all home.‚Äù¬†

He nodded and moved into the common area. I floated over next to him and examined the bandage on his ear. Up close, I could see that the white fabric was darkened and crusted with blood. There were dark lines on his skin, spreading out from under the bandage.¬†

‚ÄúWhen did this happen?‚Äù I asked.¬†

Dr. Stromm shrugged, ‚ÄúYesterday? Last month? Eons ago? I can't really tell.‚Äù He turned to face me, ‚ÄúI'm not alone in here anymore.‚Äù¬†¬†¬†

I tried to give him a reassuring smile, but the way he was speaking was a little too unsettling.¬†¬†

When I removed the bandage, I nearly gagged. If I hadn't been wearing my helmet, I'm sure I would have. Dr. Stromm‚Äôs right ear was swollen and discolored, a black viscous fluid oozed out from it and floated in the air between us.¬†

‚ÄúJesus.‚Äù I said under my breath before pushing the soiled bandage back into place.¬†

I moved back away from him as Neilan's voice came over my comms.¬†

‚ÄúMajor, you need to get the data and get off of that station now!‚Äù¬†

I had forgotten about the video feed. Command was seeing everything I was.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell is wrong with him?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúAll you need to know is that Dr. Stromm is now designated a biohazard and will not be coming back with you. Get away from him and retrieve my data.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCopy that.‚Äù I said, never taking my eyes off of Stromm, ‚ÄúWhere will I find the data?‚Äù'¬†

‚ÄúHead to the biology lab, the files you need should be accessible from there.‚Äù Said Harry.¬†

‚ÄúI'm on my way.‚Äù I said as I turned to head down the corridor.¬†

‚ÄúWhere are you going?‚Äù Asked Stromm from behind me.¬†

I turned back to face him, ‚ÄúI just need to go get some things and look for the other crew members. I need you to wait here until I come get you. Okay?""

Stromm smiled wide, his gums had turned the same oily black as the ooze that dripped from his head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not coming back for me, but that's okay.‚Äù¬†

I didn't know what to say so, I just turned and continued on to the biology lab. I searched every room on the way, but still there was no sign of the crew.¬†

‚ÄúCommand, I can't find the rest of the crew.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNever mind the crew.‚Äù Said Neilan, ‚ÄúIf they are there, they may be infected as well.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúInfected with what?‚Äù I asked.¬†¬†

‚ÄúUnknown.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúBull shit.‚Äù I said losing my patience, ‚ÄúYou know what this is Neilan, I want answers.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúRetrieve the data and samples, and I will tell you what you want to know.‚Äù¬†¬†

I grunted in frustration as I pushed off another wall, ‚ÄúYou fucking better.‚Äù¬†

This whole situation was fucked, I was up here on a top-secret research station with an unknown biohazard. If something went wrong, there was no help coming. They wouldn't risk another mission no matter how valuable the data was.¬†

I entered the lab and found a cold storage unit containing several vials of a purplish black liquid.¬†

‚ÄúAre these the samples?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Said Neilan.¬†

‚ÄúRemove them carefully and place them into the transportation cooler.‚Äù Said Harry, ‚ÄúAnd Major, move quickly. Do not let the samples get too warm.‚Äù¬†

I took a steadying breath and began removing the samples and placing them into the cooler as carefully and quickly as I could.¬†With the samples stored, I¬†glided over to the computer terminal, ‚ÄúCommand, what do I need to do here? Do I download specific files or just rip out the hard drive?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúBetter just remove the hard drive, Royce.‚Äù Said Harry.¬†

‚ÄúAgreed, time is of the essence.‚Äù Added Neilan.¬†

I removed the tool bag from the pouch on my suit and prepared to start removing the computer housing, but then I paused. On the screen, I saw the station camera access point. Would Neilan really give me the answers I wanted? I didn't think so, maybe I could find some answers right here.¬†

I sat down the tool bag and selected the video files.¬†¬†

‚ÄúMajor, we don't have time for this. Remove the hard drive and leave the station.‚Äù Demanded Neilan.¬†

I ignored him and scrolled through the camera files, looking for anything out of place.¬†¬†

‚ÄúMajor Royce!‚Äù¬†¬†

There, the time stamp showed just before the solar storm. The feed showed Dr. Stromm in the biology lab, he was dressed in a biohazard protection suit. On the lab table in front of him was a dark egg-shaped stone about the size of a football, he was attempting to drill into the stone. Suddenly the camera shook and the lights in the lab went out. Shortly after the storm hit, the emergency lighting came on, painting the lab in shades of red. Stromm had stepped away from the table, clearly distressed. But Stromm wasn't what I was focused on.¬†¬†

The stone on the table had cracked open, a dark fluid leaking out from the cracks. After a moment Stromm noticed it too. He slowly approached the table, bending down and examining the substance. For some reason, perhaps a lapse in judgement, Stromm reached out and touched the slimy liquid. As he pulled back, the ooze stuck to his gloved hand. He tried flicking it off, but the ooze seemed to take on a life of its own, clinging to the suit and worming its way up his arm. Stromm panicked and flailed, trying to get the dark fluid off but nothing he did seemed to stop it. The ooze climbed to his head and melted through the hood of the suit, latching itself to the side of Stromm‚Äôs head. The feed ended.¬†

I scrolled through the video files, trying to find what happened to the rest of the crew. There had to be answers here.¬†

‚ÄúIs it time to leave now?‚Äù Said Stromm.¬†

I turned to see him in the entry way to the biology lab. The black fluid seeped from his eyes and ran down his face like tears. As he pushed his way into the room, globs of the stuff trailed off of him and floated through the air.¬†¬†

I swallowed, ‚ÄúNo. Not yet. Can you tell me what happened to the crew?‚Äù¬†

Stromm floated across the room to the observation window. He was silent for a moment as he looked out over the sea of stars.¬†¬†

‚ÄúDr. Stromm?‚Äù I prompted, ‚ÄúWhere are the crew?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt is time to leave now.‚Äù He said as he turned to face me.¬†

‚ÄúRoyce, get out of there.‚Äù Said Harry.¬†

I shook my head as I backed away, ‚ÄúI'm sorry Dr. Stromm, but I can't let you leave.‚Äù¬†

Suddenly, Stromm launched himself across the room and collided into me. We both fell back into the hallway, bouncing back and forth off of the walls. I tried to push him away but, Stromm reared his head back and began ramming it into my helmet over and over again. Blood and black ooze began to cake my helmets visor.¬†

‚ÄúGet the fuck off of me!‚Äù I yelled.¬†

He didn't relent, over and over he slammed his face against the helmet glass. I had to do something; I was quickly losing my vision. I reached down to the tool pouch on my suit and felt the screwdriver handle. I began stabbing Stromm with it over and over again. I must have gotten a lucky shot because in the next moment he went limp. I couldn't see through the gore coating my helmet and to my horror, the black ooze was beginning to eat its way through the glass.

I quickly unlatched the seals and threw the helmet away. It drifted across the room through floating rivers of the black ooze. Stromm‚Äôs body floated a few feet away, the screwdriver lodged into his eye socket. I was about to make my way back to the shuttle to get the hell out of there when I realized that his undamaged eye was still following me.¬†¬†

‚ÄúDr. Stromm?‚Äù¬†¬†

His body twitched, ‚ÄúDr. Stromm is not here.‚Äù he said, his voice hauntingly monotone.¬†

‚ÄúWho are you? What are you?‚Äù I asked, my heart pounding.¬†

‚ÄúDo you truly not know?‚Äù he asked in that same monotone voice, ‚ÄúWhy else would you reach for the stars, if not to climb to the heights of those who came before you? Or, is it simply hubris that drives you? When you look up at the stars do you not see us looking back? Have you so easily forgotten your old gods? They have not forgotten you.‚Äù¬†

I shook my head, ‚ÄúI don't understand.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou are not meant to. You cannot stop what is coming‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI stopped you.‚Äù I said.¬†

‚ÄúYou killed a vessel, nothing more. There will soon be another.‚Äù¬†

As he said that I felt something cold and wet hit my ear. In a panic I reached up trying to get ahold of the oily fluid, but it was too small. I felt as it squirmed and wriggled through my ear and into my head.¬†¬†

‚ÄúNo! No! No! What did you do?‚Äù I demanded, but Stromm‚Äôs corpse had gone still.¬†¬†

I reached for the comms button, ‚ÄúCommand? Hello? Can anyone hear me? Neilan? Neilan you bastard!‚Äù I thought it had gone dead, but then I heard Neilan's voice.¬†

‚ÄúMajor, I can only imagine how you are feeling right now, and I am truly sorry. But I need you to continue your mission.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúGet the samples and the hard drive and stow them aboard the shuttle.‚Äù He said.¬†

‚ÄúYou can fix this right? You have a cure, you have to.‚Äù¬†I could hear the panic in my voice.

‚ÄúOnce the samples and data are stowed, I need you to stay on the Icarus until a rescue crew arrives.‚Äù ¬†

‚ÄúHow long will that take?‚Äù I asked, ‚ÄúWill I still be me when they get here?‚Äù¬†

Neilan was silent for a moment.¬†

‚ÄúNeilan?!‚Äù¬†

Finally, he said, ‚ÄúFinish your mission and wait for further instructions.‚Äù ¬†

‚ÄúNeilan?... Neilan?... God damn you, answer me.‚Äù I yelled.¬†

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gone.‚Äù Said Harry. ‚ÄúI'm sorry Royce.‚Äù¬†

I sighed in exasperation, ‚ÄúWhat do I do Harry?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI wish I had answers for you.‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúBe careful, up there on those wax wings.‚Äù¬†

Wax wings? I floated there for a moment, feeling lost.¬†I thought that Stromm was out of his mind, the things he was saying. But what if he wasn't. This was all beyond my understanding. If Stromm or whoever was speaking through him was right, then there was no way Neilan could hope to control whatever this was. I knew what Harry meant now, I couldn't let this get back to earth.¬†

I made my way down the winding corridors of the station, heading for the command deck. On the way I passed through the common area and down the hallway where I had first encountered Stromm. As I passed by the room he had come from, I heard a thud impact the door. I turned back to read the label above the door. ‚ÄúEngine Room.‚Äù Hesitantly I reached out and slid the door open. When I saw what was inside, I no longer doubted what I had to do. I had found the rest of the crew¬†

Their bodies were tangled together in a mass of dark web like slime. Their torsos were bloated and round as something wriggled within them. Arms and legs jutted out of the mass at odd angles, twitching occasionally. But the most haunting part was the way that all of their eyes had turned to face me as I entered the room. They were still alive. None of them spoke, they only looked at me, pleading for help, asking me why this had happened. I was shaking in terror as I backed out of the room and slid the door closed. I had to end this.¬†

I could feel the entity in my head now, it twisted and warped my perceptions. I thought I was heading for the command deck, but I kept finding myself back at the hatch to my shuttle. After the third time of circling back to the hatch I realized, I had to remove the risk of leaving the station. With a heavy heart I reached for the disconnect leaver. The thing in my head screamed in rage as I watched my shuttle drift off into the void of space. ¬†

My mind melted away and reformed over and over. I kept finding myself in rooms that I had no memory of entering. Eventually I found myself on the command deck. I realized I was in control; the other was dormant for the moment. I glided over to the control console and found the stations thruster controls. Space stations occasionally require course corrections, for this they use jets of compressed air to propel the station in the desired direction.¬†

I felt the entity rising to the surface as I worked, I had to hurry. I made the calculations and set the course. With the push of a button, I engaged all of the stations compressed air thrusters and launched the Icarus 1 on a collision course for the sun. I made sure to empty the reserves for the thrusters as well, if I lost control completely, I didn't want the entity redirecting the station.¬†

As the thrusters fired and emptied, I felt the entity asserting control. It tried to stop the launch but it was too late. I felt my mind breaking apart as my fists smashed against the thruster control console and I screamed in someone else's rage. At last, the entity receded and my body was mine again. ¬†

I made my way to the command terminal and began typing out this message. If you are reading this, then somehow the message got through. You deserve to know the truth, there are things out here in the void. Watch the stars. Goodluck and Goodbye. ¬†

A.A in Liberal Arts with a half finished A.A in Aviation Management.

So I have been working in Hospitality since I was 16, family owned coffee shop, then fine dining server/banquet assistant manager/craft cocktail bartender/ mixture of things since I was 16 in the Hudson Valley, stayed with places 10+ years.

I have also been an international flight attendant since 2017 for two different international airlines. I am now an inflight manager, and have been for two years. This is my passion and I love it dearly. My one biggest complaint is that the income and flights are incredibly seasonal, so I'm very broke for 5-6 months a year, and while I'm broke, my schedule is very restricted by standby/reserve days, not allowing me to do any more than 15-20 hours a week, whether if its restaurant work/or doordash. My savings are taking a big hit currently.

Last year while things at the airline were slow I took a 6 month leave to get into liquor sales in NYC, made a lot of money but burnt out so quickly, and left - I would go back to sales, but not liquor.

I am moving to Oslo in a year to live with my Fiance, and I can transfer bases and continue to do long haul flying. It will just be hard to keep up the work life balance of it all, with us wanting to start a family and start my new life in Norway. I don't think I could keep up the flying.

I am just at a loss of where I can go with my experience if it isn't staying with being a flight attendant.

With all of that information, what do you think I could do next? Go back to school? Stay in aviation but an office job ? Continue my sales journey ? Go back to restaurants?

In simple words, where would you go if your passion was flying ?

Each passing day brought new personal records for highest mountain passes. First the wintry p√°ramos of Colombia‚Äôs Northeastern Cordillera. Purple bricks of bocadillo [guava paste] became my saving grace.
 
Then the Trampoline of Death between two militant valleys en route towards the Trans Ecuador Mountain Bike Route. I crashed atop Chimborazo when the winds grew too strong. Each day saw insatiable hunts for locro de papa [bright yellow potato soup] with chicha morada [purple corn drink], but food wasn‚Äôt always so easy to find.
 
Then desert backroads across north Peru where sunkissed canyons skyrocketed beyond 16,000ft [4,968m] in Huayhuash y la Cordillera Blanca. Morning camp coffee was often the best part of my day, or momentary stops for sweet, sticky alfajores [traditional Latin American sandwich cookies].

Normally, heists were supposed to be well-executed, graceful, and quiet. But if Buck Harlow was involved, it would go more like this: He‚Äôd trip over something, knock over a priceless artifact, loudly apologize to the guards he was supposed to be hiding from‚Äîand then, by sheer dumb luck he'd still manage to get away.

His reputation in the criminal world was a joke. Everyone knew he could rob a safe, but the chances of him getting locked inside it were extremely high.

Harper Blake was one of the most respected detectives in the city, feared by criminals and co-workers alike. Her cases were always handled efficiently, solved quickly, and with no tolerance for nonsense or buffoonery.

And now, apparently, the universe hated her. Because she had just been assigned to fake date Buck Harlow.

Harper had taken down huge criminal organizations. She had thrown grown men out of windows. But pretending to be in love with the world‚Äôs dumbest self-proclaimed thief? That might actually kill her.

Or so she thought.








The first few weeks were hell.

But it got better for Harper's fifth fake date.

Buck drove Harper insane. He asked too many questions, made too many jokes, and somehow managed to trip from her car to the dimly lit cafe he had chosen to go to, it was like he was actively trying to annoy her. And the worst part?

He wasn‚Äôt even scared of her.

Everyone else in her life feared her. Criminals, co-workers‚Äîhell, even her own parents had the sense to avoid getting on her bad side. 
But Buck sat across from her, grinning like a dumb puppy, stirring his coffee so aggressively she was half convinced he didn't want to have the bitter beverage in his mouth 

Harper took a agersive swig of her caramel latte . This is my punishment for every sin I‚Äôve ever committed, she thought to herself.

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù Buck said suddenly, breaking the silence ‚Äúone time, I smuggled a shipment of diamonds.‚Äù

Harper didn‚Äôt react right away. Just blinked at him. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

He grinned. ‚ÄúYeah. Huge job. Worth millions. Had to hide ‚Äòem in‚Äî‚Äù He paused, snorted, and shook his head. ‚ÄúActually, you don‚Äôt wanna know.‚Äù

Harper set her latte down . ‚ÄúYou smuggled millions in diamonds?‚Äù

Buck shrugged. ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt call it smuggling, really. More like‚Ä¶ creatively relocating‚Äù he said moving his hands like it was the best thing he ever said , causing his coffee to go everywhere 

Harper gave him a half impressed look 

Buck caught the look on her face and smirked. ‚ÄúYou look impressed.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I am.‚Äù She tilted her head, giving him the sweetest fake smile she could give . ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to see how this story goes‚Äù.

Finally harper had got what she wanted this could get buck locked up in jail for years

I weighed about 57kg in August 2024, stayed that weight until Jan 2025. I went down to 55 in Jan and have since (Feb) dropped to 52.55 kg. 

I don't exercise, like at all - I have a disability which makes it hard to do so & I work remotely so I'm sitting a lot! I've been technically fasting for 2 years, i.e not eating breakfast or lunch, just dinner and some snacks after dinner. 

I'm getting married this year so I was like okay I need to eat healthier dinners! I tend to have 2 or 3 coffees during the morning/day, then a dinner (rice, fish, veg) in the evening and many cups of tea with a bar of chocolate and that's it. I tried calorie counting before but have a bad history of getting a bit obsessive with it so this time around I just eat the same thing daily.

I'm glad to be seeing a difference on the weight scales, I have a history of never seeing any change lol. but I am getting a bit worried that I may be rapidly losing weight? I have symptoms of GERD/LPR the last few months and on meds (that dont work for it ugh) so I'm starting to get a bit worried that I have an underlying illness causing the weight loss rather than my diet change!

Sorry for the tangent of details! Basically I am wondering if 0.5/1kg a week is ""rapid""?

1itcmkv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1itcmkv/aita_for_pressing_charges_against_my_bf/,Aita for pressing charges against my bf .,"Country : India 
My bf and I we were 15 when we fell romantic connection with each other . 
Not committed but will spent a lot of time together and knew as if we have a connection.  
His guardian and my family were extremely close . Later his guardian sexually assaulted one of my family member for a long period of time and ruined my family . 
So after that we loose all contact for 4.5 yrs . 
All this time I somewhat missed him and had a soft corner for him . Sometimes would think if I loved him or we can never have a future after what his guardian did .
It was confusing yet I miss him.and still deep down will think if he was just putting on an act like his guardian . 


Fast forward he contacted me through social media , we both were 21yr old . Instantly connected . 
I was dumb enough I told him about my past . 
I told him all the things I did bad , good , how that I had an ex and we had sex , all coffee dates I went to and etc . I was just being honest before starting a new relationship. 
He hated it since he said I waited for you and you didn't . ( He said to went to have sex with someone but remember me and returned from  there ) 
Now maybe I implemented the idea to him that I was waiting for him too but it was more like that I was always curious and will think how he is doing . Sometimes will cry thinking about him and other time knew there will not be anything . Confused if it's love or just a connection . 

Now the whole relationship was long distance so things started getting bad . Moreover In the starting months I used to tease him a lot to make him jealous etc . Since I couldn't see his face or his reaction I always felt if he is lying or something .(even if he ever cried  ) He didn't really created the boundaries strongly. As he don't really show a lot of emotions . 
 I once or twice would have compared him to my ex . 
I was immature and should have though about the way I'm telling him things . I told him I'm not guilty for getting physical with my ex but later I apologised . 
So with all the immaturity i had I put on him and then I realised and would stop . Would say utterly fake things twice so he would break up . And told him itd fake right after a min. 
I felt I made him so insecure even about my friends . 
But by the time I stopped he would keep on pressurising me , ask every single detail of all the intimate acts I ever did with anyone . He would ask all this for 5-6 hours a day . 
I can't even remember everything. Sometimes I lie sometimes I'll tell the truth but he would get angry and triggered . He would overthink all day get so angry and say mean things and apologise later . He won't stop asking questions about my ex how I did that etc etc . 
Then he would complain that I lie here or there . It felt I was getting interrogate d every single second of the day
I know I was very toxic from the beginning but he turned into something else. 
He have a fear of abandonment ( childhood trauma with physical voilence and emotional neglect ) . 
He used to have very bad mental and physical health and put all the blame on how I told him things how I took stand for my ex or anyone while he was angry and would say I'll kill them . And all I said was killing someone is wrong . 

He used to be more and more sick over jealous and overthinker . Would say I never prioritize him etc etc .
He would meet me take care of me 
Spend a lot of money on me . 
I would refuse for any expensive gifts but would still accept other things . 
He said he fight with his family for me as they were against us . He left home for me . He couldn't make any career bwcause his mental health ruined because of me. 
Of i told him things , how I compared , how I didn't waited for him in the no contact period . And he consider that I cheated on him in that period.. with many people.

He would always say he will die etc etc and I would say lemme try to repair the relationship etc you will be fine. 
I would encourage him to take therapy but he refused . 
I will encourage him to meet my family and will also break up usually every month I. Starting  because our family won't accept us but he somehow make me believe he will be focused and we will have a beautiful future together 
Or he can't live without me and atleast stay for some more time so he can heal in that time . 

He will hate me for my past. We were in relationship from mid 2023 to jan 2025 .I'll be turning 23 this year . 

He started getting a lot meaner and meaner . Would say he will kill my ex etc . And say extreme mean things on me and my character and would say that he said that in anger and don't remember it as if he is having some sort of split personality disorder. 

I can't understand myself at all . 
I was mean and rude and toxic to him but he was weird . 

He forced me to send him my such pics only bcs in past I did send that to boys I dated and twice traded that for money . I was ashamed but at that time I was thinking that I will help my parents in this way . 
I was crying while sending him those pics and did self harm . All of this happened in call as we were in long distance and met 5-6 times in the whole relationship and would stay 4-5 days together in one meet . 

I was extremely tired of being interrogated everyday . Of being called by means things everyday . I was In bad mental health state and due to I overslept I missed my final exam resulting in delaying of my degree . ( I woke up all night 2 days before that bcs he was sick . Stayed on call ) This is the timeof December 2024 . 

Important 

Now I specifically told him that don't come in between my final exams 
Now this part is triggering for me . 
He always did a lot for me 
Took care of me 
In time of relationship once 
In middle of night in a rain storm he gave me his footwear as mine broke even though he had open wounds on his feet .
Other time he fight with his family for me . 
All this time he would spend a lot onme even when he was  struggling with money . 
He would always come to meet me travelling 1500kms . 
Always stayed by my side . I cried explaing how my parents won't agree but he told me he will convince them etc etc and if they won't be would go etc . 

Before too  I clearly told him that if he can't accept pls leave or accept or punish but not all this bs . His health was declining so I can't leave I'm all these months. 

Main PART
In dec 2024‚Ä¶ I had final exams . I told him not to come . 
I missed my exam . I told him relationship problems are fucking my mental health.
.2 days after that he came to my city . I had 6 day holidays in between the next exam .
He was struggling would be sick and act crazy and more aggressive . He is way too sensitive 
Now this part triggers me 
It was evening .
He was getting crazy one day when we were in the room . He gets triggered saying he remembers my ex and what I did . I had to told him things in detail everything months before  bcs of the daily interrogation. He would say my ex send him my pics while in the act which he was lying etc etc . He thinks I always took stand for him I didn't he would just be so angry that I couldnt take his stand . ( I was betrayed and pushed to suicide due to emotional neglect as a teen by my guardian  and his anger would trigger that . I told him this clearly . If he is angry I can't take his stand. ) 
We had sex later it was okay .
Now 
Later he was angry mad and I was uncomfortable. I was lying on the bed and my hand was twisting so I told him to wait 4 times and he wasn't listening . 
He got mad 
I remember this moment . His eyes turned deep red . He said you stopped your ex bcs you were uncomfortable now you are stopping me too . I was in a vulnerable position . He was in front of me . His eyes were deep red . Anger trigger my past trauma. 
He was holding strongly my wrists in front of him . I was so. Scared . I was scared of him , scared he would make a scene . I was crying to which he shouted he will get more angry so I stopped crying . I was teary eyed and had to calm him down . Had to tell him that he can do sex with me . 
I don't remember what happen after this . As much as I do in a minute there was knock on the door. He probably did sex for like a minute or less and then we left the room . 

I had my last final exam tom.. I had to prepare internship report that I couldn't 
And now I spent all night awake preparing internship report and taking care of him as he get so sick and sleepy on the same night as his bp level dropped . I told him to break up but at that moment I couldn't leave him alone in a dark place unknown City and him being in a dead state . 
I hated all of this . 
Awake all night I prepared report, couldn't eat anything until next day evening . 
I wanted to break up he won't 
So he fell guilty etc etc and somehow I brushed everything under the rug . 
We get a little intimate and he went back to his city . But I couldn't stop thinking about this . 

Now I went to my home for winter break in 2025 jan where he would push me with his overthinking and jealousy 
 I would ask him to break up bcs of my family but he would accuse me of cheating . I couldn't stop thinking about that night . 
And In all of jan I was sick .
I was sick for all the year of 2024 but in jan I was more sick . He would push me to talk but I can't bcs I was at home no time and no privacy . Whenever I told him to break up he would get trigger and threaten to kill himself hurt my family call my parents or to kill my ex or to make me a sex slave etc . And would put all the blame of saying all these things on his other personality . That he can't control . 
Things get worse from here .
I came back to my city . 
Since I had cut off with everyone I was able to reach to 2 friends they helped me out with everything. This guy wanted to come to meet me and I had to calm him down so obviously I pretended all love and all even In half of jan ( reported this time period chats to police . . 

After  28 jan them I stopped taking his calls and stop replying to him . I was so scared . I can't touch my phone . His calls were continuously coming 
My friends and I decide to tell my parents so we booked tickets . 
But he came to my city the same day we had train 30 jan 
 
Things escalated I was in no condition to tell anyone anythimg . 
I drank a sip of hair serum and stopped from doing anything more stupid knowing I can't die . Atleast . 
I had mild fever ., extreme digestive issues can't eat or even sleep. For days during the whole process of him getting reported etc.  

End of conversation my family got to know everything , they get involved and I was so anxious scared to death . After 2 weeks my family even get to know I was sexually involved and once he abused me . My parents stopped taking to me for 5-6 days but later supported me and are there for me . I am scared if they ever get to know more of my past . 
I end up reporting him.to police jan 30 ..
I didnt wanted to but had to. 
I press charges with that he threatened to kill himself or me if I break up with him with timeline from mid Jan 2025 to jan 30 . Now there will be a legal case and he can be sent to jail . I don't know what will happen . Chances for settle ment are low . I feel as if I ruined his life .
His younger sister marriage was due in 3-4 months . 
I should have never let him enter in my life again or maybe I should have never teased him compared him told him . I don't know 
Writing all this makes me feel I was toxic but he was pathetic but do he really deserves jail time for all this .

So aita for increasing the chances of him serving a jail time 
 
At this moment I have lost myself .my trauma response is freezw so no help . Moreover um trying to focus on my career again . Afraid my family will know more about my past . 
Trying to get better . 
My extended family don't believe I was panicked would forget things was unable to tell bcs I was super drained and exhausted and even got sexually abused. 

Lemme. Know your thoughts .   
I'm unable to explain things in a more better way .

The beans in my meagre experience I would say from the colour are are medium to dark roast.

I set my K6 to 65 (for Moka Pots the insert that came with the K6 recommends 60 to 70 clicks, so I went half way.

I could see as soon as I opened after grinding that the coffee was coarser than the pre-ground I've been buying which was ground for Moka's, significantly coarser to be honest.

Anyway, I brewed up using my usual method of low and slow, and riding the heat, and as I expected, my coffee lacked body and was fairly bland and lacked any complexity 

I've had my coffee fill for today so won't be brewing again (evening here in UK), but tomorrow I'll be dialling back on the fine side to 55 and see where that takes me.

Any suggestions are more than welcome üëç

After rounding the Dari√©n Gap by sailboat to Cartagena was a 500-mile marathon along la Ruta del Sol. Heat indexes pushed +120¬∞F [48¬∞C] through Mompox toward Bucaramanga. Eight liters of water each day still wasn‚Äôt enough. The cold couldn‚Äôt come sooner. And then it stayed forever.
 
Each passing day brought new personal records for highest mountain passes. First the wintry p√°ramos of Colombia‚Äôs Northeastern Cordillera. Purple bricks of bocadillo [guava paste] became my saving grace.
 
Then the Trampoline of Death between two militant valleys en route towards the Trans Ecuador Volcano Corridor. I crashed atop Chimborazo when the winds grew too strong. Each day saw insatiable hunts for locro de papa [bright yellow potato soup] with chicha morada [purple corn drink], but food wasn‚Äôt always so easy to find.
 
Then desert backroads across north Peru where sunkissed canyons skyrocketed beyond 16,000ft [4,968m] in Huayhuash y la Cordillera Blanca. Morning camp coffee was often the best part of my day, or momentary stops for sweet, sticky alfajores [traditional Latin American sandwich cookies].
 
When I look back on those roads now, my instinctual response is choked in trauma. ‚ÄúNo way, I could never,‚Äù as if forcibly forgetting each cruel bend in the gravel.

Then desert backroads across north Peru where sunkissed canyons skyrocketed beyond 16,000ft [4,968m] in Huayhuash y la Cordillera Blanca. Morning camp coffee was often the best part of my day, or momentary stops for sweet, sticky alfajores [traditional Latin American sandwich cookies].
 
When I look back on those roads now, my instinctual response is choked in trauma. ‚ÄúNo way, I could never,‚Äù as if forcibly forgetting each cruel bend in the gravel.

Your body crumbles over and over, but there‚Äôs nowhere to escape to and no way to get there.

1itcema,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1itcema/unable_to_make_good_coffee/,Unable to make good coffee,"Since I became interested in black coffee, wanting to make it yourself is obviously attractive. Starting with a simple grinder, and a simple filter (V60), I gave it a go. Nothing as close to what my favourite cafe was serving. Ok, I'll add in scales for more precise data. Still no good. Alright, I better get the temperature controlled gooseneck kettle for precision pouring and temp control. Follow the popular recipes from basic to a bit more complex. Again, no dice. I just decided to sell the kettle and give away the rest of the stuff since I didn't really have space for a setup anyway.

Fast forward some years to now. Coffee content creators are really taking off and producing high quality videos. There's been a shift in the products available. Brands like Timemore and 1Zpresso are disrupting the grinder space which used to be held in the high end by Western grinders like Commandante C40, Kinu, Lido.

I've been told and believe that the grinder part of the coffee equation is the most crucial. I did not want to spend the prices asked by the Euro brands, but now the Chinese brands have disrupted that space, and I felt compelled to try again.

So what I have now is:

* 1Zpresso ZP6 Special
* Timemore Black Mirror+ Scales
* Ceramic 1cup V60/Kalita Wave 155 (metal)
* Hario Kasuya Mini Drip Kettle
* Domestic electric kettle that boils to boiling point (I either pour into the Kasuya or pour directly)

I've tried essentially these two recipes:

* Two big pours: [https://youtu.be/AI4ynXzkSQo?si=jVOxCy7zYNyV1Ye0](https://youtu.be/AI4ynXzkSQo?si=jVOxCy7zYNyV1Ye0)
* Five even pours: [https://youtu.be/1oB1oDrDkHM?si=4k4pxDUkketJLJHR](https://youtu.be/1oB1oDrDkHM?si=4k4pxDUkketJLJHR)

My starting point is 15g coffee, 1:16 ratio, which is 240g of coffee out.

The recommended grind setting for ZP6 is 4-5, I started at 4 and with a coffee from Peru, get a time just below 2:30. Going up to 5 speeds up the drawdown, and going all the way down to 3 won't make the brew time exceed 3:00.

All the while, the coffee is only tasting not great but weaker, to not great but stronger with a finer grind. It neither gives the clear impression of a sour underextraction, nor a bitter overextraction. It simply just doesn't taste great. For reference, I recently had a great coffee from a local cafe, not too strong, not too weak, but all the desirable flavours have been isolated and brought to the forefront, without any undesirable flavours.

Some possibilities I have considered:

* Currently I'm working with a fairly light roast. I picked up that I should use very hot water, and so I tried pouring straight off the boil, straight from the main kettle. Didn't work.
* The ceramic V60 is quite dense, and I believe it might be losing heat easily. I've tried to do a bit more preheating by pouring more hot water during the paper rinse step. Probably still isn't enough. Might replace it with a ceramic Origami Dripper which isn't so thick. I can also swap to my metal Kalita Wave, but for consistency of the recipe I think I should stick to one funnel style. When I did swap to the Kalita, my brew time changed considerably.
* I used to worry about pour technique, and that's why I gave in and got a gooseneck (twice). But I believe that with swirling or stirring added to the mix, it really, really should not be the case that I'm unevenly saturating the grounds with water.

With all that being said, its very frustrating to me that I can't quite get this down. And I do have a reference for what a good coffee should taste like, as I've enjoyed trying coffee all around my city. When it comes to cooking for example, I'm quite tuned in to what I need to change and tweak to make a delicious dish. However it just isn't working with coffee. I got all the equipment together to make sure all the data is available and measured, I can follow precise recipes to the dot, and yet, I simply cannot make a cup of coffee I like.",2,1739989102.0,pourover,7,0.75,False

Let's show some support by supporting a local Ukrainian Bakery, right here in Lakeville!  

I want to offer something we can do to show our support. This Saturday and every Saturday from now through Labor Day (if you can!), Go to Kyev Cakes on Kenwood Trail and support a local Ukrainian business. The bakery is superb (try the pavlovas and black forest chocolate cake), the coffee is good and the owner is genuinely one of the nicest people I know in town.

We were physical with each other, cuddle a lot and he also said I should join to him and their friends on a program.
He told me he is going to miss me when he will be away and then he dropped a bomb. He told me before he started talking to me he aggreed with his ex that he is visiting home and going to stay with her. He also made is sounds like the girl expecting something to happen between them. The expression he used was exactly I am not sure if she expects anything from me...then he told me he also going to tell her ex that he met me. And the only thing he can do is being honest, so if anything happens he will tell me.

I actually never had this situation and even though I am not against exes staying friends, it was a bit much for me. I was really suprised, so I didn't know what to say.

He also told me we never established what we are, casual or exclusive and asked what I am thinking about this. But after the bomb he dropped I saw no point to discuss this.

My biggest issue is that when I grind even 16.5-17g of coffee and use my distribution tool, there is always a decent bit of beans that fall out of the basket and make a mess, when I use my spinny tool to level the beans, before I tampen. My assumption is that the basket is too small, or that i'm doing something wrong.

My goal is to just do an 18g shot to 36-40g for a simple double espresso, or to make a latte with it.

Can you recommend a good 58mm basket that I can use with the portafilter that came with my machine? Any other suggestions would be extremely helpful. Do I need a better portafilter? I'll admit i'm still a novice after having my machine for a few months.

My current tools: 

* Normcore 58mm magnetic dosing funel 
* Normcore 58.5mm coffee distribution tool

However Haiti was left in shambles due to his rule, before i go into Soulouque rule i want to go over Haiti from 1844-46 the era in which Haiti was unstable.

Although General H√©rard became President, some of the electorate felt that he represented a military faction that was predominantly ""mul√¢tre;"" During H√©rard's invasion of the Dominican Republic, an armed revolt began in the Haitian countryside. he was opposed by a ""democratic party"" led by Salomon jeune, that claimed to represent the ""noirs"". Their call for greater social equality led to the 1844 uprising known as the Piquet Rebellion, led by Jean-Jacques Acaau, a rural police chief who stood up for the rights of the peasantry, or small landholders. Then Herard had to deal with another armed revolt of Mulatto insurgents in the North. ¬†Faced with this crisis, H√©rard relinquished the Presidency on 3 May 1844. He went into exile on 2 June 1844, resettling in¬†Jamacia, where he died on 31 August 1850.

[Charles Herard](https://preview.redd.it/zblwcplgqtje1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9ff60844ea640f8120cd5346f66facac46d46a1)

In May 1844 Herard was replaced with Philippe Guerrier who was a respected soldier,  Guerrier had successfully commanded the southern black army during the¬†Haitian Revolution. After Haiti became independent, he retired from active service and became a plantation owner. This was the beginning of what was later called the¬†*politique de la doublure*, which saw the Mulatto elites (notably the Ardouin brothers, C√©ligny and Beaubrun) install a Black figurehead as a president to appease the Blacks, and rule through him. Things calmed down for a few months, but a new conspiracy started in mid-1844, led by partisans of Rivi√®re-H√©rard. Guerrier, by then, had become senile and he died in April 1845.

He was replaced by another Black general, the 84-year old Jean-Louis Pierrot: the¬†*doublure*¬†policy was at work again.

[Jean-Louis Pierrot](https://preview.redd.it/ww6qinrjcuje1.jpg?width=244&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ca4b75e5e0519197bf48d9677e0fe59e2cc704b)

The Husband of Cecile Fatiman Pierrot led a black battalion at the Battle of Vertieres in 1803. During the period of the¬†Kingdom Of Haiti ,¬†Henri Christophe¬†( promoted Pierrot to the rank of Lieutenant General in the Army and granted him the hereditary title of¬†Baron and Prince of Haiti. Back n 1843, Pierrot had disobeyed Rivi√®re-H√©rard by refusing to march on Santiago. He had published a manifesto favourable to Dominican interests and even threatened to secede and declare independence for the North... Now that he was president, Pierrot declared that Haiti had to be made whole again. Skirmishes with Dominicans resumed during the summer 1845, and Haitians were defeated again. Pierrot had other problems. In September the Rivierists revolted and had to be put down. In November, Port-au-Prince went up in flames (Haitian cities went up in flames regularly, from war or from accidents). When Pierrot tried to restart the border war with the Dominicans late February 1846, the garrison of Saint Marc refused to march... and Pierrot was ousted.

He was replaced by the one-eyed, 70-year old Black general Jean-Baptiste Rich√©, also a figure of the Revolution. Rich√© faced immediately a revolt of Acaau's peasants, the¬†*Piquets*, which was rapidly suppressed. Rich√© died in February 1847 from natural causes but rumours about his death went wild (he was poisoned! he had overdosed on aphrodisiacs!)

[Jean-Baptiste Riche](https://preview.redd.it/8z56ip2chuje1.jpg?width=237&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=968f2e085a4a4d13dfd77ef957c1afde73d98978)

By 1847, Haiti was in a sorry state, with its economy in shambles after four years of rebellions and war. The oversized Haitian military, maintained at great cost - one third of the nation's budget - to fight the French and other European nations if they dared to return, had been used to fight other Haitians and Dominicans. This is one of the main reasons of the poor military performance of the Haitian army against the Dominicans in the 1843-1847 period: the Haitian state was always fighting several insurgencies at the same time, and its leaders were either incompetent and/or too willing to backstab each other. When Boyer ruled the island the Military was laughable compared to the Military of his time.

Now we will get into Soulouque



Faustin Soulouque was born on 15 August 1782 in Petit-Goave a small town in the¬†French colony of¬†Saint-Domingue, to a Haitian mother. Soulouque's mother, Marie-Catherine Soulouque, was born in¬†Port-au-Prince¬†in 1744, and was a¬†creole¬†of ethnic¬†Mandika¬†descent. Soulouque was freed as a result of a 1793 emancipation decree issued by¬† Sonthonax the Civil Commissioner of Saint-Domingue. Soulouque lived in the south which was under the control of Andre Riguard, due to his status he could only write his name. Soulouque enlisted in the black revolutionary army in 1803 as a free citizen, as his freedom was in serious jeopardy due to attempts of the French government to re-establish slavery. Soulouque fought as a¬†private¬†until 1804, when the conflict ended in revolutionary victory and Saint-Domingue achieved independence as¬†Haiti. Soulouque became a respected soldier during the conflict, and as a consequence he was commissioned as a¬† lieutenant ¬†in the¬†Haitian Army in 1806, and made¬†aide-de-camp to General Lamarre. In 1810, Soulouque was appointed to the Horse Guards under President¬†Alexander Petion and for the next four decades continued to serve in the Haitian military, rising to the rank of¬† colonel¬†under President Philippe Guerrier  Soulouque was finally promoted to the highest command in the Haitian Army, attaining the rank of lieutenant general ¬†¬†and Supreme Commander of the Presidential Guards under then-President Jean-Baptiste Riche. 

[Faustin Soulouque](https://preview.redd.it/02f031deyuje1.jpg?width=350&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ddd0911bb2ad4d6d97d07546a8ad0930aef7859)

Soulouque was perhaps the most surprised man in an astonished Haiti when, in March, 1847, he learned that the Haitian Senate had chosen him to be the next president. Jean Pierre Boyer, perhaps Haiti's greatest president, had once pointed in disgust to an insignificant military aide, remarking that even such a stupid fellow as that might some day become president if affairs grew much worse.' The sub-ordinate was Faustin Soulouque. He had been a mediocre man all his life,  Serving in the army of the mulatto presidents, Petion and Boyer, he had gained advancements slowly and unspectacularly. Why, then, did the cleverest politicians of the nation place this illiterate ex-slave in the highest position of state? It was certainly not because there was no vital need for a great leader, for Haitian affairs had deteriorated greatly after the fall of Boyer. With the ousting of President Boyer in 1843, there was also removed from power his educated mulatto elite, a minority which had ruled the nation well for a generation. The Negro masses, unprepared for self-government, soon siezed control, letting loose pent-up hatreds and commencing a race war between blacks and mulattoes which has had many armistices but no conclusion. A naive man, Soulouque was not chosen because his nation had no need for a diplomat, for Haiti had lost the Eastern Part, inhabited by the Dominicans, heirs of Spanish culture, who had seen their land occupied by Jean Pierre Boyer in 1822. Haiti at the time of the rise of Soulouque needed a tactful statesman to deal subtly and well with the group of foreign envoys, merchants and missionaries who had come in larger and larger numbers after the recognition of Boyer's government by the world powers. Faustin Soulouque was a dark horse candidate. Haiti had come to an age of mediocrity, and chance, so it seemed, had produced a mediocre man to match the era. Soulouque was chosen for his supposed lack of ability. 

  
Faustin Soulouque was soon to reveal a shrewdness wholly unexpected of the senators' puppet. Although an ignorant man, the new president was exceedingly vain and strong-willed. There were many who underestimated him and mocked him for his well-known Voodoo fanaticism. Evidence shows that Soulouque was dominated by fears, fears of the unknown, and his Voodooism probably best expressed this terror. He believed some wanga, or poison, was about to kill him. The President and Adelina (his mistress, later his wife) were faithful clients of sorcerers. Soulouque was actually afraid that the presidential palace was ""hexed"" because the late president had died there. A contemporary reported that the chairs, which he avoided as bearers of fears, Faustin Soulouque trembled only unknown. It was with little glitter and a negligible claim to respect that Faustin Soulouque entered office as president in March, 1847. At first, the man's fears dominated him, but others would soon fear him. He was frightened by the confusing details of administration, and discouraged by the mocking of enlightened mulattoes and Negroes. Having begun as a timid and rather humble questioner, the President soon took the offensive against obstacles, both human and abstract. He had several readers inform him of current events not only in Haiti, but throughout the world, and, with their assistance, he was able to know the contents of every bill before signing or vetoing it.7 Nevertheless, by July of 1847, Soulouque's fears had deepened, and the perplexed president, suspecting that several senators and his own ministers were plotting to overthrow him, offered to resign. The Senate, however, assured him of its loyalty, and he decided that, although he had not wanted to be president, he would continue in office, maintain his power by any means possible, and rule as he saw fit.

By 1848, the new president had already lost confidence in the educated senators, Dupuy and Cligny Ardouin, who had been the chief backers of his nomination, and instead, he had begun to follow the advice of Similien, a Negro warrior who hated all mulattoes-and even well-to-do Negroes, whom he called mulattos. The Negro peasants shared  his antipathy for the ruling group. They wanted less work, higher wages and primary education. Negroes were often deeply in debt to wealthy mulatto lords and merchants, an economic grievance which soon reenforced Soulouque's anti-mulatto policy . Animosity grew between the blacks and mulattoes. People conspired openly and  On Sunday, April 16, 1848, the storm broke. Mulattoes were killed on sight. Ardouin was shot trying to escape and taken to prison, That day the President called to the palace these general and politicians whom he suspected of conspiracy in the supposedly imminent mulatto march upon the capital. The Guards within the palace fired upon the unarmed mulattos in the court yard and Dupuy barely escaped over a wall. Panic spread through the capital and all mulattos armed themselves for the horror to come. Many Mulattos were wounded and several killed, Black Generals who tried to keep order were considered mulatto accomplices. For two days the mulattos were being massacred with most of the victims being professors, merchants and doctors. Needless to say the British and French Consuls demanded the right of asylum be respected, Soulouque did grant several pardons just to shoot those he released. Similiens followers at Port-au-Prince had two goals in mind, the destruction of the mulattos and to repudiate the debt owed to France contracted two decades before.

While Foreign ships were rescuing the fugitive mulattos and the race war was slowing down, Soulouque was conceiving a new way to insure his power and feed his vanity. Napoleon someone he greatly admired he decided to establish a monarchy in Haiti. In order to have a legitimate family Faustin married his beloved concubine Adelina and took her daughter under his wing making her Princess Olive. Faustin First invasion of the Dominican Republic occured On March 1849, which resulted in some initial success the army reaches to within fifteen leagues of Santo Domingo but Faustin realized he needed to go home. The army was poorly provisioned and according to one observer rumors of conspiracy to overthrow him followed him through out the Dominican Republic. ¬†The Haitians fled, abandoning their six guns, their horses and their muskets, torching and pillaging villages on their way home. Returning to Haiti, on August 26, 1849 Soulouque was pronounced Emperor by the Senate. (The Chamber of Representatives had met the previous day.) He coyly accepted among scenes of popular jubilation, assuming the title of Faustin I.

The White and Mulatto rules of the Dominican Republic Faustin considered his natural enemies, he could never consolidate his rule without his conquest so in 1850 he prepped for another Invasion. The Emperor held his own struggle with the three great powers, Great Britain, The United States and France. The Europeans were divided on Faustin drives to the East, the US feared Haiti reconquering DR due to a free Haiti scaring Southerners. The British supported Faustin claim over DR due to not wanting the United States to gain more power. Even though they all had different opinions on Faustin they all decided to step in.  When the demands and only slightly veiled threats that Haiti renounce its claim to sovereignty over the eastern half of the island and grant a definitive peace or a ten-year truce had failed, Great Britain and France proceeded to blockade Cap Haitien. Though Soulouque yield-ed to the blockade, neither of the demands was met ; instead Soulouque extended the truce for twelve months. Despite this concession, Faustin ""had given no evidence that he had yielded to force. By implication he had not abandoned his claim to sovereignty over the Dominican Republic. On April 19, 1851 the Walsh of the United States, Raybaud of France, and the Usher of Great Britian united to present their demands. They demanded Haiti would have to make peace with the Dominican Republic or sign a ten year truce. Soulouque promised to continue the truce but would not negotiate with the Dominicans until they recognized his suzerainty. Both Great Britain and France were fairly well satisfied and withdrew their pressure and threats.  Despite his threats Against the Dominican Republic he suggested confederation to the Dominicans, a purely nominal union giving them control of their internal affairs but denying use of any part of Hispaniola to foreign powers.

During his rule, the united states tried  to capture Navassa Island and Faustin quickly responded by sending warships to counterattack them. The United States guaranteed Haiti a portion of the revenues from the mining operations on the island, and Soulouque withdrew his warships.¬†However despite his Black Nationalism, His popularity started to decrease. Faustin did try to stimulate an already failing economy but that was not enough, The nation was also hit by a severe depression in 1857 and throughout 1858 , much of it caused by a failure in the coffee crop and a drop in prices abroad. Faustin tried one last time to Invade the Dominican Republic  in  November 1855 despite the threats from the European Powers. ¬†Soulouque's army was unprepared, and lacked proper logistics, food, and ammunition. Entire units deserted, sometimes even before they met the enemy. The Haitian army was routed, battle after battle, and retreated at the end of February. The Emperor had several of his generals shot. He did not declare victory this time, and, on 27 January 1856, blamed the defeat on treason. With all of this happening Faustin was loosing popularity and the people decided he needed to go.

No one dared risk his life to overthrow the Empire, and there was little liberty, property or career to sacrifice. But there was Nicolas Fabre Geffrard, a man who, following thetraditions of his family, opposed the extremes of Negro or mulatto supremacy. It is ironic that in a reign of iron, and paradoxical in a land of great contrasts, that Soulouque respected and trusted this man. In 1846, Soulouque, then still an aide of President Riche, had tried and acquitted Geffrard before his court-martial. Later, Faustin became close to the man he had saved, and in his turn, showered General Geffrard with honors and titles. He made him Duc de la Table and a power in his cabinet. Soulouque seemed confident that gratitude would make Geffrard incapable of conspiracy.

Geffrard was equally blessed with luck and personality, he gained popularity in the Dominican invasions for both bravery and mercy. He became a hero when he saved the Haitian Army from complete rout and capture. By the year 1858 Geffrard was taking full advantage of popular grievances to overthrow the Empire. The plotters of the revolt trusted Geffrard who was willing to lead the country and the aging Faustin was soon to face the man he once trusted. On December 20, 1858 Geffrard and his followers set up a provisional government declaring the Empire Abolished and the Republic restored. Emperor Faustin replied on Christmas Day, he said he knew his country well but that he had established the Empire to insure order and tranquility. Geffrard was marching on Port-au-Prince with 6,000 men agaisnt Faustin 3,000 troops and the rebel arms grew in numbers with them winning victories. Then on January 15,1859 the rebels entered the captial with everyone cheering vive le President Geffrard! When Faustin learned what had really happened, he distributed some newly printed money to his guard and loyal followers, and gathered up the family's portable belongings. He seemed disheartened, tired, even undignified. Adding to this strange scene was His Majesty's insistence upon carrying his own trunk on his shoulders to the Imperial Family's asylum in the French Consulate. That trunk contained the fortune which the refugees would need in their future travels. Remembering the kindness of the Empress and Soulouque's former trust in him, Provisional President Geffrard sent a detachment of infantry of the Republican Guard to protect the ex-Emperor in his retreat to that same center of safety which Soulouque had earlier guaranteed to his mulatto foes. Soulouque found protection but not peace in the French legation. Outside, rioters threatened his life and appeared about to break in. Since all was certainly lost, Faustin I's formal abdication was drawn up by Damien Delva, the treasurer. Meanwhile, the rioters had almost broken into the French Consulate, but the British had come to the rescue. Consul General Byron had called on Captain McCrea of the British ship ""Melbourne"" to land and protect the refugees. Soulouque, it is believed, gave this seaman 50,000 francs to take his family aboard. It was on January 22, 1859 that Soulouque and their daughters, Olive, Olivette and Celia, left the shores of the new Republic. True to the tradition of Haitian exiles, Soulouque went to Kingston. A crowd of ill- wishers met the ship, and it was with difficulty that the fleeing family landed, for this port had been the refuge, too, of Soulouque's political opponents. A Miss Grant, proprietor of Blondell's Hall, refused to accept Faustin and his family at her hotel. They finally got accommodations elsewhere, but at a very high price. The exiles continued to torment the old and sick man. Bricks and sticks were thrown at his carriage, and his life was threat.  For the reign of Faustin had been transitional period, a turning point in Haitian History and that turn was not entirely for the better. The instigator of that old era Faustin Soulouque, was to live in Jamaica, and then return to Haiti 1867 on the fall of his foe, Geffrard. There at his birthplace Petit Goave, the cove of seventeenth-century pirates, the old ex-Emperor with the heart of a pirate and much of the buccaneer's crude  magnificence, died on August 6, 1867.

I 26(F) had a heated argument with my tatay (54) 2 weeks ago. Sobrang lala ng away namin na nagsigawan na kami, hindi ako yung anak na sumasagot lagit or what, I keep silent as much as possible kase ayoko din na nasasagot ang tatay and also since wala nakong mom and I only have my dad. Kami nalang nga sa buhay e. But he has his live in partner pero once a week lang umuuwi and I am staying here sa bahay for few months now dahil he had a surgery back in October so I had to take care of him. 

He's jobless, I am a breadwinner. Yung live in partner nya may stay in work pero her salary is solely for her mga anak lang. Barely buying anything dito, I don't care anyways just for context lang. To make this short, I've been the one providing para sa aming lahat and a lot of things had been compromised since I stayed here sa province. I have been living independently in the city and things were waaaay better for me.

Sa sagutan namin that day, he told me and my partner na nag-aasikaso sa kanya na umalis na kami dito sa bahay dahil perwisyo kami at malas all because we sleep until noon or afternoon dahil panggabi ang mga work namin. He hates it na tanghali nagigising kahit walang pasok dahil malas daw, all because nagigising sya ng maaga only to drink his coffee at humilata na sa sala buong araw. Tatayo pag magcCR, lalabas para bumili ng yosi and such, and syempre kumain. Bihira lang sya magluto, lahat kami pa din. He can't even sweep the floor. And yes, ever since bata ako asa na talaga sya sa mom ko. Sole provider din ang mama ko noon. Si erpats? Nakakatrabaho pa extra extra 2-3 times a year or in 2 years. 

I got pissed off and lahat ng naipon kong sama ng loob at galit all these years sumabog. So I shouted na napakasama ng ugali nya. Tinago ba naman lahat ng lutuan para hindi kami makapagluto ng partner ko. Sabay sagot nya na ""ikaw ang masama ang ugali PI mo kang hyp ka lumayas kayo dito mga PI nyo!"" We can't leave yet, savings and lahat ng funds namin nagastos para mapagamot sya. 

Days after, I tried to reconnect inaalok and binibigyan ko sya ng food pero hinahayaan nya lang langgamin and mabulok. So I stopped. I asked him na lilinisin ko na open wound nya sa likod and he said, wag na at wala na daw akong pakialam sa kanya wag ko na syang pakekealaman. 

I stopped reaching out and stopped talking to him. Now his live in partner reached out to me in messenger na pagpasensyahan nalang daw dahil tumatanda and all and I was like since bata ako ganto na to. Lumala pa nga e. Haha. I didn't respond then later that day nagkkwento na sya na nahihirapan na sya sa ugali ng tatay ko na wala na syang freedom, bawal sya magshare post sa fb na may lalaki, bawal sya lumabas kasama mga anak at apo nya and keep the money instead of going out, things like that.  I told her na ganon din sya sa nanay ko before but my mom was a tough woman so hindi sya under ng tatay ko. 


Now I've been hearing murmors sa kapitbahay at tindahan na pinapabayaan namin si papa, na nasa iisang bahay lang pero di namin shinesharean ng pagkain. Naexpect ko na to pero nakakagalit pa din pala. Haha. But idc. I'm so done. Naaawa ako pero he has to learn his lessons. 

So, ako ba yung gago kung hindi ko na inaalok at binibigyan ng pagkain ang tatay ko kapag nagluluto kami?

Edit:  Kumakain naman sya he has money I don't know san galing. Pero I'm glad na nakakakain pa din sya at least. Hindi lang ako sanay na ganito setup. Masakit sa puso tbh but kailangan ko tibayan e. Sya nagtulak sakin maging ganito.",6,1739988743.0,AkoBaYungGago,2,0.87,False
