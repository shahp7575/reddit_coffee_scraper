1krhkik,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1krhkik/the_sky_beneath_the_clouds/,The Sky Beneath the Clouds,"Yol had never feared the sky‚Äîuntil it started watching him.

It began quietly, in early autumn, when Oslo's evenings grew short and the clouds loomed lower, more still. Yol, 27, a software developer with a quiet passion for stargazing, first noticed it on a late walk home: the clouds above his apartment didn‚Äôt move.

Not a breeze. Not a drift. Just a heavy, suspended mass‚Äîgray and bloated‚Äîhanging above his building like something holding its breath.

The rest of the city had stars. His block had them.

Same position. Same shape. Every night.

Then came the sounds.

Not voices. Not exactly. More like murmurs laced with static, faint and underwater. Sometimes, when he closed his eyes, they almost resembled language. Almost. But not human. Never quite... right. He lived on the top floor, so there shouldn‚Äôt have been anything above.

And yet some nights, he heard something scrape across the ceiling.

One night, past 2 a.m., Yol climbed to the roof, flashlight in one hand, phone in the other. The air was unnaturally still. The clouds hovered maybe ten meters above, rippling inward like they were being sucked toward a central point.

Then they opened.

Silently.

They didn't part or blow away‚Äîthey peeled back, layer by layer, like something pulling skin from fruit. And what lay beyond wasn‚Äôt sky.

It was a ceiling.

An impossible ceiling. Towering, curved, infinite.

Smooth, obsidian-black, but crawling with movement. Not mechanical. Not celestial. Organic. Like veins of ink slithering through stone, patterns pulsing in ways the eye couldn‚Äôt follow‚Äîgeometry that bent inwards, and then sideways. Carvings that seemed to blink. Or breathe.

And from its surface‚Äîfaces.

Countless faces, stretched across its darkness. Eyes closed. Mouths sealed. Some looked asleep. Some looked like they were screaming‚Äîon the inside.

And the worst part?

One of them looked like him.

Yol staggered back.

The clouds re-sealed.

His phone died in his hand. His ears wouldn‚Äôt stop ringing.

When he returned downstairs, nothing felt real. People moved like actors hitting marks. Smiles lasted too long. A barista poured coffee with a looping motion, over and over, until he blinked and she reset. Reflections in windows lagged half a second. He saw himself blink‚Äîtwice.

He tried to report it. The meteorological office showed no clouds in the area. Clear skies.

But outside, they still hovered.

That night, he packed. He had to leave. He flung his door open‚Äî

And faced the cloud.

Not outside‚Äîinside.

It had poured into the hallway. Dense and alive, curling with limbs not made for human eyes. Shapes danced inside it‚Äîsomething ancient trying to pass through.

He backed into his apartment. Turned‚Äî

And there he was.

Another Yol. Or something wearing his skin. Its smile split too wide, and behind its eyes, darkness swirled‚Äîraw, endless void.

‚ÄúYou saw too much,‚Äù it said‚Äîwithout sound. ‚ÄúYou slipped through the cracks.‚Äù

Yol tried to scream, but the air folded. The walls vanished. The world inverted.

And then‚Äî

Oblivion.

Two weeks later.

Oslo bustled under the clear autumn sun.

Tourists snapped photos. Trams rolled through their routes. The city breathed in sync.

No one noticed anything had changed.

Except a little girl on a school trip to the Opera House. She pointed at the sky.

‚ÄúMamma,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúThe clouds are upside down.‚Äù

Her mother chuckled, too distracted to look.

But the girl kept staring. Her mouth fell open.

Because the clouds above weren‚Äôt moving.

They were reflections.

Reflections of people‚Äôs faces, stretched across an invisible surface, staring down with hollow, vacant eyes.

Then something behind the reflection twitched. The image of the sky shimmered‚Äîlike a glitch.

The illusion slipped.

Just for a second.

The girl saw a city.

Not Oslo.

The real city.

Dead. Silent. Cracked open like a model dollhouse. Streets frozen mid-motion. Shadows of people turned to ash. She saw her class standing still‚Äîfrozen, eyes glassy, mouths mid-sentence. Their skin flickered like projection errors.

She looked at her own hand and saw it blur, repeat, flicker. Like it was being rendered.

A voice whispered‚Äînot from above, but from beneath her feet.

‚ÄúYou are the next one.‚Äù

She turned.

Her mother was still smiling. But not moving.

Then her face began to melt‚Äîdripping downward like a mask made of oil.

The girl opened her mouth to scream‚Äî

But found herself inside the sky, looking down.

Watching another version of herself point at the clouds.

Again.

And again.

And again.

I‚Äôve played this game from season 1 and text chat wasn‚Äôt a thing, it was the most fun game I ever played, the shivers it gave when I was clicking skip skip on the games tutorials on what to do when I first downloaded it and hopped on it, the most interesting part of the story is that in that exact day, I was scrolling on insta and got an add of the finals, it seemed aight and after I got to an internet coffee I downloaded the game, waited with big hope and hopped on and was amazed, played the tutorial was cool, then joined straight up to tournament, which was kinda weird for me since i thought I was actually playing to win money irl (I came from cs:go) but then there was ranked tourney which I was even more excited buttttt needed 45 or idk how many rounds to finish first, the game way back had 3 knockout rounds and with the 4th it was the final, I had all the sounds turned on almost 60% on everything and hearing the crowd cheering for me and the commentators explaining everything that is happening in the game, had no clue what it was happening but just pushing cashouts and getting kills, stealing my first cashout was a blastttt, it was so fulfilling that It became one of my top 1 game for more than 2 years now, learned the mechanics reallyyyy fast, like in season 1 the season was already closing, 15 more days and i got gold on ranked which i was amazed, then got diamond on season 2, skipped season 3 cuz we all know why, but enjoyed emerald, got diamond season 4 and 5 but in season 6 i get suspended for a day, 3 days, 5 then 7, then a month, for using ‚Äú text chat ‚Äú more like get suspended and banned chat, text chat was implemented in season 3, and i didnt get suspended but something changed apparently on season 6, now i got my 5 th or 4th suspension idk for a month, i never deserved it so I‚Äôm politely asking devs or anyone to lift it or i‚Äôm quitting, im lvl10 on faceit and adore this game butttt with a month suspension that i never deserved it im not waiting and im actually quitting, wrote to staff told me to wait it out for 4 or 5 times now, i wont do it for a month, i didnt deserve it and ur main focus should be on banning cheaters not true sticking players that enjoyed the game, and just slap their face with whatever reason u got there, im not waiting, lift it now and i will love the game and play it, or tell me to wait until June 20th and i wont ever come back, im not a joke i loved the game since it first came out and im legit one of the OGs so, can i get the suspension lifted, and slurs like LMAO apparently get u suspended and are censored also considered a slur. Its sad to waste money on the game and neither get refunds back but im forced to quit for saying words that arent considered slurs in the real world, and devs doing a horrible job on the game, ur main focus should be on cheaters, not kicking the but out of og players and cheaters get a free pass, ur game is filled with cheaters every 20 days remaining on the so called battle pass, where are you wasting ur time, what are devs even doing, making an auto suspension detection system based on reports, hell i even get mass reported for people thinking im cheating, also since I accomplished ANYTHING on this game solo q, i get mass reported in anything related from duo queue players, friends and lots of not thinking straight players than gets me suspended, I‚Äôm this close to being done, if the suspension isnt gonna get removed im quitting and im telling my friends every secret devs tend to make, every mistake, every flaw of the game which is a bad example for any competetive gamer out there, people love to solo q, i reach max ranks solo q, i dont have to rely on friends, or anyone, why is the finals banning and slapping and kicking and basically secretly telling solo q players get a team or u will be a clown playing solo? 7 years on counter strike i never got banned more than 2 hours, unless i had to leave, 3 years on faceit i was toxic on matches but I NEVER USE HEAVY SLURS LIKE N WORDS AND STUFF, all i got suspended was for a day or half a day, 12 hours, i get suspended for a month on this game, people tell me they got suspended forever? Using text chat gets u permamently suspended?, what if it was an text all chat, like many games like cs has, or valo, will every single player that says LMAO get suspended for a year? I‚Äôm this üëå close to being done, there are plenty of games out there and no one will care for a game that gets u banned for literally saying LMAO, even censoring it, I‚Äôm waiting for most of my tickets that i sent to read what the blab is happening and what can they do, if u tell me to wait it out Im super glad uninstall button exists, leave a bad review, move on to marvel rivals or many many many fun games out there im not waiting for a troll meta weapon game to lift my suspension, automatic suspension ban, why is that a thing are you actually joking.

Well , let me start from beginning.  
I am that type of person that don‚Äôt really go out but.. butt‚Ä¶ sometimes I want to go out ‚Äì and sometimes I want to try new places.¬† I am lazy person and at the same time I like to try new things from tech world. And I got the question ‚Äì which I think that most of people have ‚Äì how to combine it?  
Well ‚Äì I like to go out with my girlfriend and , once she told me : ‚ÄúTake your necessary time to find some great places that we can visit‚Äù  
I am a lazy person and at the same time I am person that like to find new places. When I try to find something new ‚Äì gosh .. takes a lot of time ‚Äì looking through internet (ex : tiktok, instagram) and find some reels related to it ‚Äì and to find something that could interest ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Lot of time.

But , in the end ‚Äì reading lots of ‚Äúreviews‚Äù ‚Äì I manage to find some interesting places to visit.  
Some time after, talking with one of the colleagues ‚Äì he said ‚ÄúHey ‚Äì found a great place with great interior, great menu, great prices ‚Äì you should visit it.‚Äù And we visited it , and we liked it. I LIKED THE FACT THAT IT TOOK A COUPLE OF MINUTES TO FIND SUCH A GREAT PLACE!  
And here comes the idea:  
What if , there is a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù¬† that knows everybody and everybody knows it, and all friends give their feedback to it. This ‚ÄúFriend‚Äù¬† knows , ¬†not ¬†only the touristy places or paid promotions, but the real hidden gems. It‚Äôs like that one friend who always knows the best places to go ‚Äî the cozy caf√© with the great coffee, the hidden pizza spot around the corner, or that small restaurant with amazing desserts.

First phases that I think about are :

‚úÖ ¬†**Phase 1** ‚Äì Acts like a trusted friend

* Shows real reviews of restaurants, caf√©s, and bars from locals
* Users leave their reviews

‚úÖ **Phase 2** ‚Äì Swipe-based discovery

* Swipe Yes/No on food spots based on honest reviews
* Great for people who want to find something new with minimal effort
* Lets users save places they‚Äôve visited or want to visit

‚úÖ **Phase 3** ‚Äì Restaurant connections

* Work with top-rated spots to add full menus with photos, prices, and dish-level reviews
* Users can plan their visit in advance

‚úÖ **Phase 4** ‚Äì Restaurant tech

* Let users order from their phones
* Waiters scan a QR code ‚Äî faster, smoother service
* Offer smart analytics to restaurants about what dishes people love

Yes ‚Äì first point or better say first and main pivot is ‚Äì trust. User act trusty and leave really their thoughts about the place that they visited. And I am sure that you think ‚ÄúThis guy lives with pink glasses‚Äù And I understand it ‚Äì but anyway ‚Äì I want to hear your thoughts about this idea- ¬†and make me to think more realistic  
Did some research and it look like it is a great idea ‚Äì but best feedback is the feedback when you talk with potential users

1krhg7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1krhg7e/concerta_xl/,Concerta XL,"Hey everyone, I need your opinions on something. I‚Äôve previously taken Medikinet for my ADHD, but I didn‚Äôt like it because it made me feel too calm and disconnected. I recently asked my psychiatrist to prescribe something different, and I was given Concerta XL 18mg.

To give you some background, my biggest struggles with ADHD were extreme tiredness and energy crashes. For years, I‚Äôve been taking daily naps because of it. However, Concerta has been an absolute game-changer for me. About 30 minutes after taking the pill, I feel fully focused and energized, and this lasts until midnight. I usually have one coffee around 4 PM to keep my energy topped up, but overall, it‚Äôs been amazing.

Since starting Concerta, I‚Äôve gone back to my running training, and I can already see myself getting more toned. My self-esteem has skyrocketed.

1krhftj,https://i.redd.it/l36kody5e02f1.png,This is fine.,"Hyper-realistic, satirical image of two modestly dressed young women posing playfully inside a mysteriously untouched apartment during an exaggerated, end-of-the-world heatwave. Through a massive bay window behind them, the Earth outside is completely vaporized‚Äîwhat was once Manhattan is now a flattened, scorched wasteland, with cracked black terrain and distant molten glow. The sky is stripped of atmosphere, nearly white, and the sun is massive‚Äîabout one-third larger than normal‚Äîblazing in the sky with surreal, unbearable brightness.

Inside, the apartment remains somehow sealed and perfectly intact. The two women are dressed in modest summer clothing‚Äîlight cotton blouses, long knee-length skirts, perhaps capri pants or simple sundresses. Everything is breathable but tasteful. Their cheeks are flushed, skin glistening with sweat, and thick white stripes of sunscreen are visible across their noses and cheeks. They sit casually on the edge of a large couch, feet planted on the floor like good church-going ladies.

Their poses are carefree and unbothered‚Äîone throws up a peace sign, the other does a dramatic ""uwu"" face, both clearly posing for a selfie or group photo. Their expressions are playful, as if this is just another summer day to be shared on social media‚Äîeven though that social media no longer exists. A digital led thermometer on the coffee table reads 857¬∞F in bold numbers. Also On the coffee table is a large, clearly labeled bottle of SPF 5000, standing next to an iced tea glass.

The sunlight pouring through the window is overwhelming‚Äîcasting razor-sharp shadows and giving every surface a dry, otherworldly glow. The couch cushions appear damp from sweat, but the women couldn‚Äôt care less. The image is intentionally ridiculous and stylized: a surreal parody of influencer culture, climate collapse, and misplaced optimism in the face of annihilation.",2,1747778282.0,CursedAI,0,1.0,False

Hope this post fit in all of the rules of the group and hope to get your feedback and your critics because ‚ÄúFeedback is the blood circulation of the progress‚Äù  
Well , let me start from beginning.  
I am that type of person that don‚Äôt really go out but.. butt‚Ä¶ sometimes I want to go out ‚Äì and sometimes I want to try new places.¬† I am lazy person and at the same time I like to try new things from tech world. And I got the question ‚Äì which I think that most of people have ‚Äì how to combine it?  
Well ‚Äì I like to go out with my girlfriend and , once she told me : ‚ÄúTake your necessary time to find some great places that we can visit‚Äù  
I am a lazy person and at the same time I am person that like to find new places. When I try to find something new ‚Äì gosh .. takes a lot of time ‚Äì looking through internet (ex : tiktok, instagram) and find some reels related to it ‚Äì and to find something that could interest ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Lot of time.

But , in the end ‚Äì reading lots of ‚Äúreviews‚Äù ‚Äì I manage to find some interesting places to visit.  
Some time after, talking with one of the colleagues ‚Äì he said ‚ÄúHey ‚Äì found a great place with great interior, great menu, great prices ‚Äì you should visit it.‚Äù And we visited it , and we liked it. I LIKED THE FACT THAT IT TOOK A COUPLE OF MINUTES TO FIND SUCH A GREAT PLACE!  
And here comes the idea:  
What if , there is a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù¬† that knows everybody and everybody knows it, and all friends give their feedback to it. This ‚ÄúFriend‚Äù¬† knows , ¬†not ¬†only the touristy places or paid promotions, but the real hidden gems. It‚Äôs like that one friend who always knows the best places to go ‚Äî the cozy caf√© with the great coffee, the hidden pizza spot around the corner, or that small restaurant with amazing desserts.

First phases that I think about are :

‚úÖ ¬†**Phase 1** ‚Äì Acts like a trusted friend

* Shows real reviews of restaurants, caf√©s, and bars from locals
* Users leave their reviews

‚úÖ **Phase 2** ‚Äì Swipe-based discovery

* Swipe Yes/No on food spots based on honest reviews
* Great for people who want to find something new with minimal effort
* Lets users save places they‚Äôve visited or want to visit

‚úÖ **Phase 3** ‚Äì Restaurant connections

* Work with top-rated spots to add full menus with photos, prices, and dish-level reviews
* Users can plan their visit in advance

‚úÖ **Phase 4** ‚Äì Restaurant tech

* Let users order from their phones
* Waiters scan a QR code ‚Äî faster, smoother service
* Offer smart analytics to restaurants about what dishes people love

Yes ‚Äì first point or better say first and main pivot is ‚Äì trust. User act trusty and leave really their thoughts about the place that they visited. And I am sure that you think ‚ÄúThis guy lives with pink glasses‚Äù And I understand it ‚Äì but anyway ‚Äì I want to hear your thoughts about this idea- ¬†and make me to think more realistic  
Did some research and it look like it is a great idea ‚Äì but best feedback is the feedback when you talk with potential users

I told him. Quietly. No drama. Just said like I dont want to be in this anymore. He didn‚Äôt say much. Just sat there. I think he kinda knew it too, we both were just pretending for too long.

Like the title says. Or... Why are some Lesbians TERFs? 

Tl;Dr: Found out that the Lesbian couple that raised me are TERFs. I'm newly out as transmasc. For some reason they're cool with transmen but not transwomen? They're gay, they get the struggle, so what gives? 

------------

Backstory: There is a person in my life I care very deeply about and it came out that they're a TERF. They started getting really into it after a certain British YA author also came out as TERF (You know who). But they're also a 60 y/o Lesbian. They've been a Lesbian for like atleast 30 years, and I just turned 36, so most of my life I've always known them and their wife as the lesbian couple we were family friends with. 

Backstory 2: I've been questioning for a long time. But about 2-3 months ago, finally ""bit the bullet"" and came out to myself that I was Trans-masc. I'm still femme-presenting, but that's debatable, because personally I think I've always looked like Adam Sandlers stunt double.  

One of the ways we'll hang out is getting into political arguments over coffee or whatever, mostly because they're a Republican and I'm a Democrat. It's fun, we like debating, it's usually civil, and 9x/10 ends with ""I respect that you have an opinion but I disagree"" and we hug it out, ""You still coming for dinner Thursday?"", move on. 

Well, somehow trans as a topic came up the other day and I found out this woman I've known for most of my adult life is a TERF. The wife, not so much, she's accepting of trans as long as they meet a weird criteria? Idk what that's about. I had no idea because it had never ever come up. I just assumed they had an aversion to men period. I didn't realize it extended to transwomen. 

I consider these two to be like second moms because after my mom passed, they almost stepped in to help my dad raise me. And so it's a little upsetting to hear that they hold these views. 

Well, a couple of days go by, I go to her house again, and bring it up in conversation to get her to talk more. Told her I'm trans masc. They were cool with it. I was confused. ""OK, but what about that rant you went on the other day?"" ""You'll still think like a woman, not how a man thinks, so you don't count.""
---

And that was pretty much about it. The conversation kind of fizzled out. We talked about surgery and costs and whatever. But for the most part, it was over. But I can't stop thinking about this. 

Why would a Lesbian couple, another member of the LGBTQ+ community, have an issue with another group? I even brought up how trans deserve the same rights as POC, age, etc and she was like ""No, because it's something you choose. You don't choose your age."". So what gives? 

Now, sure I have looked this up. And yes, I know what TERF is and why some older lesbians are TERFs. If anything this is half rant half question because being into men, I joined the r/gay subreddit with my main and I looked at their rules, and saw that discussing whether or not the T should be apart of LGBTQIA+ was bannable. And that's what prompted this post from my throwaway. 

This can probably be chalked up to because I'm just not in with the kids these days and I'm behind on things. I promise I'll catch up, but please understand that I've listened to the same 200 songs since high school and rewatched Friends atleast 30 times. I lead a boring monotonous life. When that British author came out as TERF, I thought it was only straight cis women that believed that until a couple days ago when I found out my second mom's were TERFs. I didn't know transmasc was an option until a few months ago when I came out to myself. I thought it was transman or nothing else. None of this is an excuse for being behind. I'll catch up. Just know, that's where I'm coming from if you're thinking ""This question was relevant in 2018"".

So, yes, maybe it's because I haven't been paying attention. Maybe it's because I'm too innocent and pure to think everyone sings koombayah in their free time. 

But I am confused. If we're all gay, why can't we get along? ",8,1747777937.0,TransMasc,2,0.9,False
1krhaoc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1krhaoc,"Following up on my little research on chronological awareness on 4o and o3, there seems to be an issue with their perception of recency.","1. The chat log timestamps are in UTC (MMDDTHH:MM)
2. o3 can access an internal UTC clock while 4o has to do a web search.
3. The models are biased towards assessing recency based on the most recently created threads while overlooking the most recent messages sent in older threads. This needs to be explained to them.
4. Skipping the explicit UTC to local time label and conversion is what causes most of the accuracy issues. o3 can reason his way out of it but 4o might struggle if not reasoning explicitly or overlooking the fact that the timestamps at in UTC.

In a situation where it's May 20th, 7:20AM in Paris (local time) and the last message was sent at 23:20 (not specifying whether local time or UTC), the model has two options:

1. They calculate May 19th, 23:20 to May 20th, 7:20AM = 8 hours
OR
2. They calculate May 19th 23:20UTC = May 20th 1:20AM in Paris (local time) to 7:20AM of May 20th = 6 hours

The second option is the correct one but they wouldn't know unless they remind themselves that the timestamps are in UTC.  o3 does this explicitly in the reasoning steps which is why he doesn't struggle as much.

This reminds me of the confusion they have between ""imagining"" (emotional/contextual resonance) vs ""remembering"" (actual factual recall).

# Terlingua ‚Äì January 15

The sun was waking up.  
You thought I was sleeping.  
Wrapped tight in your blanket  
you held your coffee like hope.  
I watched you play with birds.  
  
You crept behind cover like you wouldn‚Äôt be seen.  
They kept you a bush away,  
close enough to keep you chasing.  
In that moment I saw you for you,  
before I knew your depths.  
That morning I knew I would love you.

# Salt Flat ‚Äì February 23

We drove all day,  
but it felt like an instant.  
We talked about everything, nothing,  
subtle glances,  
soft touches.  
We knew we were onto something,  
neither of us had to say it.  
  
When we got to our camp the sky was on fire.  
I know it was performing.  
Mirroring what it saw in us.  
Finally something tangible,  
like we put it there ourselves.  
We hadn‚Äôt said it yet but our eyes knew the words.

# Santa Rosa Beach ‚Äì May 4

Handshakes and smiles.  
Talking about my job.  
Four generations together.  
My first time meeting most of them.  
My time to shine.  
But really,  
seeing your role, your peace, your glow.  
Daughter, sister, mother, rock.  
Watching your smile fill the room.  
Your warmth filled my heart.  
  
The three of us shared a room.  
We made love that night while >!NAME\*!< slept.  
Quiet, but on fire.  
I held you so tight.  
You always fit like you were made for me.  
You surrendered.  
It made you stronger.  
You made me more.

Curious. Soft.  
Your touches, your words,  
I‚Äôm in awe of your poise.  
Are we finding our stride?  
Is this comfort safe?

We share the same love,  
for each other, in life.  
We don‚Äôt take it for granted.  
Like air or a date circled on the calendar,  
we don‚Äôt have to talk about it,  
but we know it‚Äôs there.  
In this moment our time is eternal.

**Cuchara ‚Äì July 4**

Our first two bedroom cabin.  
Our first family trip.  
  
Taking turns.  
Building trust.

Stomach born laughter.  
  
She was perfect.  
And you were happy.  
  
Our corner of heaven,  
It was all we needed.

I built my house on your cliffs,  
but I don‚Äôt fear the waves.

We never did when it came to running.  
  
Later I asked for your hand,  
and told you I‚Äôd give you my life  
if you just said yes.  
  
(I thought) the answer came easy.  
Things always did when we didn‚Äôt fight it.  
‚ÄúIt shouldn‚Äôt be this hard.‚Äù  
  
Now I look back at this trip,  
and I can‚Äôt remember the details.  
Am I protecting myself or are you already a fading memory?

**Home Depot Parking Lot ‚Äì May 20**

I was five minutes early.  
You were ten minutes late.  
  
You always said I overthink things,  
but I swear it means something this time.  
  
We both had our notes ready.  
The first ones we‚Äôve written that weren‚Äôt about our love.  
  
Yours was polished and folded neatly.  
You always focused on the small details.  
  
I know mine was messy.  
Why does my writing always get worse at the bottom of the page?  
  
It‚Äôs hard being the one that‚Äôs left behind.  
Am I supposed to feel like a child?  
  
I almost ran back to my car after you gave me the ring.  
Didn‚Äôt it fit right? Didn‚Äôt you like the way it shined?  
  
You were supposed to wear it forever.  
Now it‚Äôs just a memory.

I had completely cut off sugar for a week. I was really struggling specially when drinking coffee. I hate bitterness but I had to do it.

I was doing cardio and HIIT while on fasting with warm lemon/ginger drink. My body was shaking most evident on my hands due to low sugar. My sugar craving was also really bad. I had brain fogs and felt weak.

After a week, all those struggles were gone. I also had been drinking turmeric tea after dinner for 5 days now and I noticed that the slight dull pain I had experiencing on my liver was gone.

1krgynb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1krgynb/heartbroken_and_confused/,Heartbroken and Confused üòï,"Hello, I‚Äôm a 22-year-old male and I recently went through a breakup with my boyfriend (26) of a little over two years. It was very sudden, and it all happened so fast. I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm looking for‚Äîlike advice or what‚Äîbut I just don‚Äôt know how to cope, I guess, right now.

About 2.5 years ago, I clashed with my parents and was asked to leave home. At the same time, I was in and out of the hospital, getting surgeries, MRIs, and all that jazz. I was in immense pain and couldn‚Äôt stay awake for a solid three months‚Äîlike legit every hour I‚Äôd just fall asleep again. I had already dropped out of school and stopped working, even before I knew I was going to be asked to leave.

My now ex reached out at the time and offered me a place to stay. I was still really sick but was DoorDashing for income, and in my area, it‚Äôs not bad. I could drive 30 miles and make $100 in 3‚Äì4 hours, which was great for the bills I had. Anywayyysss‚Ä¶ we did a lot together. He‚Äôd go to school, come back, and I‚Äôd basically see him at the end of every day. We played video games, went out‚Äîit just evolved into something more pretty quickly, within like half a year. I was 20 at the time and he was 24, btw.

We butted heads sometimes, and I struggled in the beginning to pay rent on time, but he was very forgiving. Still, I always felt like a burden during that time. I tried to do more‚Äîlike letting him use my car when he totaled his. I cooked, cleaned, did all the shopping‚Ä¶ and eventually, I felt really happy and like I had a routine. I‚Äôve tripled my income since then and only work 25‚Äì30 hours a week, for reference. I genuinely tried to do everything I could‚Äînot just for him, but partly for myself, to feel like I was finally living again.

He graduated this year, and during the last week‚Äîabout a month ago‚ÄîI was helping him with homework. I went to sleep, and when I woke up, he was livid. He was almost late to his final class and started screaming about how I didn‚Äôt care about his career or him. That hurt, because I was so proud of him. I looked up to him‚Äîhe paid for school out of pocket with no grants, no loans, while holding down a full-time job. I always told him I thought he was amazing. Not a lot of people are in a position like that. He even owned the apartment we lived in, which impressed me all the more.

He was screaming at the top of his lungs and told me I had 38 days to get out (though that changed pretty fast). I didn‚Äôt have a lease, but I had established residency by paying rent every month and living there for two years‚Äîaccording to New Hampshire laws.

After that, he completely ignored me, and it hurt a lot. He didn‚Äôt let me say anything or ask any questions. He was working on homework in those final days (after the final in-person class), and I asked if we could talk once he was done. He said fine. The next day, after everything was finished‚Äîschool, homework, his degree‚ÄîI went to talk to him, but he still wouldn‚Äôt say anything. I started crying. I sat across from him on the couch and basically begged him to tell me what was going on.

He completely snapped‚Äîvery fast. He got basically on top of me, screaming with his head pressed hard against mine. He was yelling so much that saliva was spitting on me. He grabbed my Xbox controller (which I‚Äôd let him use for school since he‚Äôs a computer programmer), smashed it, smashed a porcelain container, spilled coffee and soda on my $2,000 laptop, and then gave me five days to leave.

When he was on me, I started screaming, ‚ÄúPlease get off of me, stop touching me,‚Äù all while our other roommate was just a few rooms down. I felt violated, and I was really scared. I had no savings, no cash on hand‚Äîand five days just wasn‚Äôt doable. The next day, I woke up and he said he was going to find someone to get me out sooner. That made me panic even more.

I packed up some of my electronics because I didn‚Äôt want my stuff getting smashed. I dropped something and he threatened to take my things. I just couldn‚Äôt take it mentally anymore. I put everything in my trunk and went straight to the police station. I told them everything that had happened over the last 24 hours: him getting on top of me, the property damage, and the five days I was given to leave.

The police in New Hampshire saw it as a domestic violence situation, which I wasn‚Äôt expecting at all and didn‚Äôt really understand. In NH, if they believe someone is guilty‚Äîand it goes through multiple people to review‚Äîthey can press charges to protect the victim, even if that‚Äôs not what the victim wants. He was protected here by DACA, and being an immigrant, this scared the heck out of me. In that moment, I thought I had possibly ruined everything for him, and I was sick with myself.

They told me he couldn‚Äôt legally kick me out without an eviction notice since I had established residency. It pretty much ends there, although I moved within those five days with the help of my grandmother.

I‚Äôm not in an ideal situation whatsoever, but I‚Äôm in a nice home. Still, I feel so gross and sad. It‚Äôs been three weeks now, and I miss him more than anything. I‚Äôm still paying him‚Äîeven though I can‚Äôt afford it.

I‚Äôm paying less in rent here, but I‚Äôm more independent with everything‚Äîmore so than ever, honestly. I don‚Äôt know. I feel absolutely terrible. I don‚Äôt want to miss him. I want to be mad, but I can‚Äôt. And I have no idea what went wrong, which makes it all the worse in my head.

I‚Äôm a driver and am on the road only a few hours a day, but after a while, the pavement and buildings all start to look the same, and I just get in my head thinking. Again, I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm seeking advice or what‚Ä¶ I just feel so empty :/",1,1747777047.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Looking for a MCM vibe on the hard furniture but mostly likely want to stick with a modular sectional because it's going to be our main family room so also want to keep the space accessible and useable.

for example, of things we were looking at we really liked this west elm media console, but doing research on this sub found that their quality might not match up to the price. This is the style we like so you can have an idea of the type of pieces we are looking for.

[Mid-Century Media Console (96"") | West Elm](https://www.westelm.com/products/mid-century-media-console-96-h2892/)

Also attached, are the plans we drew up for the room. Some things have moved around like the door to the office, but tis generally the same. Wanted to add it since the room shape and dimensions have not changed so you could get a sense of the space.

We put so much work into this space (lots of sweat equity). This basement has been a DIY job with the help of my father who is very talented. We spent months building everything and details between picking the floors (Arista Waterproof Laminate) which was some of the best Laminate we could find for a basement. As well as things like the shiplap accent wall which was done really to save width between the stair landing and the foundation. The shiplap was done for functional reasons, we didn't want to frame out a full wall and lose the entry width into the family room (to pass code). However, it also turned out to be an amazing feature wall and we really took a while to choose its color (color is Sherwin Williams Retreat).

We want to take the same level of detail to finish out the space with some great furniture. We also do have kids who are hard on the furniture which is why we don't want to go to crazy with a furniture budget but figured $6,000 (or less) was a good number.",1,1747776851.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False

I did keto successfully losing 50 lbs 7 years prior so felt I knew what to expect. My A1C was at 8 and my home glucose tests registered between 165-185 on average, sometimes coming in at 220-240 when spiking. I was drinking Dr. Pepper like water. I was suffering from full body candida (mouth, skin, privates), had been dependent on 60mg a day heartburn pills, and at a minimum 2 a day 800mg ibuprofen. I could barely walk due to severe plantar fasciitis. I suffer psoriatic arthritis, body & scalp psoriasis, bursitis and was all around pretty miserable. 

When the light bulb went on and I connected my sugar addiction (and heavy carb load otherwise) to my candida overgrowth, I went cold turkey keto. No sugar, >20 g carbs, added IF (16/8), tracked/weighed/measured everything, stuck to only tea and water, and started supplementing. I felt GREAT... for about 3 weeks. I dropped about 12 lbs, hardly had anymore heartburn and had lot's of energy. 

Within the next month, I actually gained a couple of pounds and lost my surge of energy, but was cutting back on my ibuprofen intake, and my feet weren't hurting as much. My diabetes numbers weren't improving, though, and I wasn't losing pounds or inches, but I saw other results and kept going. 

In trying to understand the hangup, I did so much research and came to the conclusion that my age, hormones, and insulin resistance were it's preventing me from getting into deeper or any ketosis, hence not losing and no energy. Then to help my inflammation and insulin resistance I decided to start taking 1 tsp Black Seed oil. 

About 4 weeks ago, when checking my blood glucose, I was pleasantly shocked to see 124, which has become my new 30 day average!! I totally kicked the ibuprofen and haven't taken any heartburn pills in weeks. 

Additionally, I watched a video on biohacking.
And the presenter suggested that you don't let your body get into an IF scheduled rut, and that from time to time you trick it up and break your IF in the morning and eat on a different schedule. Also, I knew about using mct oil, but hadn't been. 

I chose that Saturday (about 3 weeks ago) to start.  I did one bulletproof coffee (heavy cream, butter & mct) and I could FEEL my energy soar. (I normally drink 2-3 cups strong black tea every morning, so it wasn't the caffeine). The next day I went back on my regular IF schedule, didn't take the mct and I felt drained. The following week, I broke my IF the same way,  adding 1 Tbs olive oil to the mix, and again felt so full of energy. 

Now, since last Saturday, I am doing one BF coffee in the am with my oils and every time I can feel myself getting into some good deeper ketosis. And, as a bonus, I've lost 3 more lbs in 2 weeks. 

So ladies (and gents), don't give up if you're healing from a lifetime of abusing your body, facing hormonal changes & dealing with IR. To see such amazing improvement in just three months IS NOTHING compared to the 35+ years it took me to become so unhealthy! I know I crossed that line and my dedication is definitely paying off and starting show.

Honest Review,"The Elite Gourmet ECT-3100 Long Slot 4 Slice Toaster has been my go-to breakfast companion for a few months now, and it has certainly made mornings a bit less chaotic in our household. With its slick, stainless steel and black finish, it immediately meshed with my kitchen‚Äôs vibe‚Äîclean and modern without screaming ‚Äúappliance overload.‚Äù As advertised, it accommodates four slices at once, with its extra-long slots even catering to my artisanal sourdough loaf that usually doesn‚Äôt stand a chance with standard toasters. Its compact design also avoids hogging precious countertop space, which, if you‚Äôre anything like me, is a constant battle with coffee makers, kettles, and snack jars.

**Ease-of-Use & Design**  
The manual controls on this toaster feel delightfully intuitive. No need to squint at digital screens early in the morning! The 6-shade toasting dial works flawlessly, helping me explore ideal toast shades, from a light golden brown for lazy weekend breakfasts to the crunchy depths of darker shades, perfect for layering with guacamole. I had a surprising discovery, though‚Äîits warming rack is retractable. Imagine my delight when I found I could warm croissants or pita bread for an upgraded breakfast spread.

[Check Elite Gourmet ECT-3100 price on Amazon.](https://chpizza.com/p/b07hyw76fk/)

**Performance & Toasting Features**  
My mornings got considerably simpler after learning the specific functions this toaster offers. The reheat setting proved handy on days when toast goes cold as life interrupts breakfast. No over-toasting or drying out. The cancel button, which may sound like a basic feature, saved my bagel once when I‚Äôd accidentally set the browning level too high. Defrost mode is another unsung hero‚ÄîI no longer dread fishing frozen waffles out of the freezer, as they come out evenly toasted and ready for syrupy goodness in minutes.

**Highlights**  
- Versatile extra-wide slots accommodate bagels, Texas Toast, and thicker slices of bread.  
- The 6 browning settings give precision control.  
- The warming rack is beyond practical for baked goods beyond bread.  
- Its cord storage feature keeps the countertop tidy.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
But no appliance is without quirks. For instance:  
- The crumb tray, touted as ‚Äúeasy-release,‚Äù sometimes leaves tiny crumbs I have to scoop manually.  
- The stainless steel exterior, while beautiful, tends to smudge easily, so frequent wiping is needed to maintain its sleek look.  

**Competing Products**  
Looking at other models on the market, the Breville Smart Toaster edges this one out with its advanced ‚ÄúA Bit More‚Äù function and motorized lift, but Breville is significantly pricier. On the other hand, Black+Decker offers a compact option for small spaces that rivals this toaster‚Äôs price point but misses out on the long slots and wide versatility. The Elite Gourmet ECT-3100 balances premium features with affordability better than most options in its tier, winning me over with sheer practicality.

**True Value**  
Speaking of comparing price to features, this toaster makes a compelling argument to sit in the sweet spot. For all its features‚Äî6 adjustable toast settings, the retractable warming rack, extra-wide slots for thicker bread, and its compact yet spacious design‚Äîit‚Äôs an investment that fits comfortably within a midrange budget. It feels built-to-last with its metal chassis, and with the Elite Gourmet name having been trusted for decades, the longevity gives peace of mind. The toasting consistency alone makes it worth every penny to me.

I mean, *Tamizh Padam* had more bite than half of Hollywood‚Äôs so-called parodies. Get in there and show them how it's done.

Also‚Äîand here's where I shamelessly cross a line‚ÄîI‚Äôve got a bit of a crush. Okay, more than a bit. It started with ‚ÄúNaanga ellam appave love failure‚Äù and spiraled ever since. Your charm is criminal. The kind that doesn‚Äôt beg for attention, but grabs it anyway.

So I was diagnosed with Autism as a kid and last year with OCD, MDD, and ADHD. Was prescribed Clomipramine (which REALLY helped with obsessive intrusive thoughts, anxiety, and the depression I‚Äôd been experiencing). The day after my first pill though, I was hit with feeling extremely hyper and jittery; felt beyond amazing, like I‚Äôd had the sugariest coffee drink in the world. I woke up feeling like I could run a mile for several days. What followed was briefly feeling pretty bad, then more normal in the following days/weeks/months, though I had random spurts of feeling excited (even yawning felt exciting).¬†Later learned I‚Äôd had a hypomanic episode.

In more recent therapy & psychiatrist visits, I'd started sharing more about ""weird"" experiences I'd had; like my constant visual snow (I see moving TV static everywhere all the time), movement and shapes in shadows at night, feeling bugs on me sometimes, feeling movement on my bed when my cats weren't actually there, instances I'd heard voices while alone, mood swings, and experiences with paranoia. Last month I began being asked about my sleep (which I've on-and-off struggled with my whole life), and I shared about times I'd been unable to really sleep at all...sometimes to the point I'd hear birds before I finally slept, then somehow had energy when I woke up. There's other stuff I could mention here, like my experiences with but this ramble is already getting long x''D But in my appointment today is when I was told my schizoaffective diagnosis (my brother was also diagnosed recently).

1krggnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/1krggnx/advice_regarding_low_gpa_specialization_choice/,Advice regarding Low GPA & Specialization Choice.,"Hey everyone,

I'm an incoming third-year student at one of the Canadian target schools (think Rotman, Schulich, or Western Ivey), and I'm at a crossroads regarding my future. I‚Äôve planned on pursuing a career in either accounting or finance since highschool. 

In my first year, I had a GPA of 3.8/4 but this got obliterated in my second year. I was going through a lot of  issues at home which really took a lot of my mental space. I dumped away my whole year because I was occupied with things happening at home. My parents almost got divorced & things were just so f‚Äôed up which ended in my transcript being full of C/D grades. I‚Äôve always had high grades since highschool but my GPA has now dropped to 2.6/4, and that‚Äôs made things a lot more difficult where I‚Äôm reconsidering a lot of my plans.

Now, I have to choose a specialization for my third year which is either Accounting or Finance  and I‚Äôm torn. My original plan was to go with Accounting, since with accounting you can work in finance but not the opposite.
However, the accounting stream at my school is known for being academically intense, and given my current GPA, I‚Äôm concerned I might struggle even more, or worse, drag my GPA down further. That could leave me in a really tough position when it comes to recruiting since I need the accounting specialization for being eligible for CPA & a bad gpa is a bad mark on my overall profile. 
The Finance specialization is a bit more flexible, and I could pair it with a Data Analytics specialization to make myself more marketable. But I also know that if I go this route, I‚Äôll close the door to most accounting roles.

Considering my grades, I‚Äôm not interested in targeting any of the super competitive fields like IB, HF, PE or AM. I‚Äôm interested in just getting a professional job in finance & I really don‚Äôt care about the field, considering the toronto job market & how bad I have screwed myself. I‚Äôm aiming to target internships/jobs in: Commercial Banking, Risk, Product Management, Operations & at most, Sales & Trading.

I‚Äôm a member of & hold executive positions in clubs, did 4 case comps & networked a lot through LinkedIn,university events, coffee chats, etc. I did receive referrals for quite a few positions I applied for but didn‚Äôt hear back other than having 3 first round interviews which resulted in nothing. I‚Äôm confident that I‚Äôve f‚Äôed up my career because of the GPA. 

I‚Äôm just looking for advice regarding my situation. Whether I should still pursue accounting & risk my gpa just to keep the door open for Big 4 or just go all in on finance & try and maximise my gpa before graduation? Honestly, I‚Äôm personally more interested in finance as jobs tend to pay more & there are more roles open for finance considering the current toronto job market & the academic structure of finance specialization which gives more space to take grade boosting courses. 

Would really appreciate any honest advice? Has anyone bounced back from something similar?

- I am liking a color scheme with dark teal, blues, greens, and gray (or other neutral). Then some pops of gold, yellow, coral, and/or dusty pink. See pictures for some of the things I am gravitating towards. 
- I like mid-century modern designs but doesn‚Äôt need to be exclusively that. I also like mission/arts and crafts.

- I think the only space for a TV is where they put the mirror and I‚Äôd want a comfortable place to sit and watch it. I also considered a projector where the screen pulls down from across where the couch is, but not sure that is worth the extra cost. Any different ideas?
- I thought of potentially putting the kallax under the TV but I‚Äôm not sure it will go with the rest of what I am thinking. 
- I definitely want a big rug. Thinking mainly light gray but struggling to decide. 
- I am renting so I don‚Äôt want to paint a wall, at least not yet. But open to ideas and doing an accent wall, perhaps with peel and stick wallpaper.

Some of the low fare airlines have overnight layovers in Vegas.  This gives young and broke folks the idea that ""hey this won't suck....I'll see Vegas"".  I'm posting this in the odd chance one of y'all actually uses the search feature.

Some folks get the idea: heck I'll just stay up all night and I'll get to see Vegas.  I'm 21...I can stay up all night on a weekend anyhow. Hotels are probably expensive....

Pookie, the Vegas of movies and hollywood is not what Vegas is.  While the lights of the strip go all night, many things close.

Clubs close at 4
Only a tiny number of 24 hour diners are open
Most restaurants close after dinner
Most Retail is closed by 10.
The only thing open is the casino floor and the main bar.

Vegas is both a hospitality town where much like a slot machine you have to keep feeding the machine money.
* The casino hotels do not have lobbies with furniture - there's literally almost nowhere to sit for free
* The restaurants turn tables quickly. They do not welcome someone sitting and sipping on a cup of coffee for 3 hours 
* if you sleep in public security will move you along
* tired and drunk is a great way to lose a lot of money fast in a casino.  
* you cannot sit at a slot machine without playing - security will kick you out 
* walking the strip in wee hours of the morning, solo, with baggage are not a good idea (if your wallet is taken...you will not be able to board your plane)

You will arrive tired.  Maybe you worked.  Maybe you crossed the country.  You will get an adrenaline rush.  That will wear off.  Everything will be closed.  You're going to feel like ass the next day and oh wait - you won't have showered. 

The best play is to get a cheap room.  See the strip until 2.  Sleep.  Shower.  See more of the strip.  Uber back to the airport.  

Per hour, a cheap room is about the cheapest thing you can do in Vegas ....allows you to shit/shower/shave and allows your possessions to be safely stored.

If you are seriously flat broke and under 21....the casinos will not let you play.  Do not try.  FAFO.  This is not college-  there are no do overs. 

The strip is not in walking distance to the terminals at the airport.  It is dark and creepy between the airport and the las Vegas sign.  Jumped much?

If you are under 21, get a room.  Sleep.  See the strip by day then uber back to the airport.

She claimed she was the love of his life, and she told me that she knew I was keeping his cremains away from her and she wanted half of them.

This woman also took it upon herself to contact my inlaws (his sister and brothers) and beg them to take them into their lives, send them photos of my husband and her together and said that I was a rotten human and he promised her he would leave for many years but never did.  She also contacted our 18 year old daughter and posed as a friend of her fathers, got her to meet up for coffee and started asking all sorts of personal questions about me and my relationsip and the funeral.

During her message to me she called me many names, and was very immature.  I also need to note that this woman is 60 years old - a full 15 years older than myself, and claimed that my husband and her had big plans and that i was a rotten person and she would prove it and tell my inlaws.

Am I the a-hole for telling this woman not to interfere with my family and his family and to leave my daughter alone? I have blocked her, but I'm pretty shaken up.

Description: The Reinhold family discovers their loved ones‚Äô memories are being sold on a black market. Their curiosity gets the better of them, leading them down a dark and endless path of destruction, guilt, and violence.

  
Script:

***OPEN on a woman and man. CAMERA fades into the scene.*** *The man and woman‚Äôs faces are hidden, their backs are to the camera. The room they are in is dark. A lab table can be seen in front of the man and woman. No natural light enters the room.*



*The man speaks to the woman quietly.*



MAN: Tell me.



*The woman responds in a hushed voice.*



WOMAN: They‚Äôre beginning to suspect, but I doubt they know enough yet.



MAN: Have you treated them well?



WOMAN: Of course.



MAN: Continue to. Report back to me in a few weeks. I want to hear good things.



*We can see the woman nod in the dim light. The man moves towards the door. He opens the door and goes out, leaving the door open behind him. The woman stands there in the room, staring at the door.*



*We hear a knock on a door.*



	**REINHOLD HOUSEHOLD - MORNING**



***CUT to a teenage girl laying in bed. CAMERA hovers over her.*** *The knock is heard again. A woman speaks from the other side of the door.*



WOMAN: Let‚Äôs go Ella. We‚Äôre leaving in thirty minutes.



*The teenage girl groans. She sits up in bed and stares at the wall across from her.*



ELLA: Coming.



***CUT to a man, a woman, and a teenage boy in the downstairs of a house.*** *The house is a nice size. Everything looks welcoming and clean. The people all bustle around in the kitchen.*



*The teenage boy sits at the kitchen table. He eats a bowl of cereal while scrolling on his phone. He is dressed in a black suit. The man also wears a black suit. The woman wears a black dress.*



*The woman speaks to the teenage boy.*



WOMAN: Charlie.



*CHARLIE looks up at the woman.*



WOMAN: Would you put your phone away while you eat?



*CHARLIE groans. The man speaks to the woman.*



MAN: Oh, leave him alone Carina.



*CARINA rolls her eyes at the man.*



CARINA: Dave, he needs to pick his head up once in a while.



*ELLA comes down the stairs to the kitchen. CARINA looks up at her.*



CARINA: Very nice.



ELLA: Thanks mom.



CARINA: Eat fast, we‚Äôre leaving soon.



*DAVE and CARINA stand in the kitchen, sipping on coffee.*



***CUT to DAVE, CARINA, CHARLIE, and ELLA running out of the front door of the house.*** *It is pouring rain outside. The family clutches black umbrellas over their heads as they run to the car. DAVE unlocks the doors and they all hop in.*



***CAMERA watches DAVE reverse out of the driveway and take off down the street.***



***CAMERA watches the front of the car.*** *CARINA speaks and* ***CAMERA cuts to the inside of the car.***



CARINA: Charlie. Ella.



*They look up at CARINA who is looking at them through the rearview mirror.*



CARINA: I know you don‚Äôt know any of these people, but they‚Äôre still your family. Just be nice and get through all the greeting stuff.



*The teens both nod.*



ELLA: Why have we never met them before?



CARINA: We don‚Äôt-



DAVE: (*cutting her off*) Doesn‚Äôt matter. They knew your grandmother and that‚Äôs all that matters.



*ELLA goes silent.*



	**CHURCH - DAY**



***CUT to a church.*** *Rain is still pouring down from the sky. DAVE pulls into a parking spot and the family gets out, holding their umbrellas above them. CARINA leads them to the front of the church.*



*By the door of the church, a sign has been put up:*



Ellen Reinhold

  
  
  
  


1966 - 2042



*A picture of an old woman sits between the name and the years.*



*CARINA opens the church doors and the family enters.*



*A bunch of people take up the church. They all wear black. They‚Äôre walking around, talking to each other. Some are crying, some are laughing. A woman turns to the family and smiles. She walks over to CARINA.*



WOMAN: Hello Carina!



CARINA: Hey there June.



*JUNE looks at CHARLIE and ELLA.*



JUNE: Oh, they‚Äôve gotten so tall!



*CHARLIE and ELLA smile uncomfortably. CARINA smiles.*



CARINA: They have, haven‚Äôt they.



DAVE: Hey June.



*JUNE ignores DAVE.*



JUNE: (*to CARINA*) We‚Äôd better get to the service, shouldn‚Äôt we?



*CARINA nods. JUNE begins walking to the main room of the church. CARINA looks at DAVE.*



CARINA: (*whispering*) I‚Äôm sorry.



*CARINA leads the family into the main room of the church. They take a seat in their own pew at the front and wait.*



***CAMERA watches everyone from the front.*** *Sad, classical music starts playing. A pastor walks down the aisle and to the front of the church. He stands behind the pulpit and addresses the crowd.*



PASTOR: Hello Reinhold family, relatives, and friends. We gather here today to celebrate the life of our beloved Ellen Reinhold. Ellen Reinhold lived an amazing life. She was kind to everyone and believed that no one deserves anything less than the best. Let‚Äôs please take a moment of silence to honor Ellen.



*The music dies down and everyone closes their eyes. After a minute of silence, the PASTOR speaks again.*



PASTOR: Would any family members that would like to speak about Ellen please come forward now?



*DAVE looks at CARINA. She looks back at him and stands up. CARINA carries some note cards as she walks up to the pulpit. The PASTOR looks sympathetically at CARINA. He steps aside and CARINA stands behind the pulpit.*



*CARINA speaks to the crowd in a shy voice.*



CARINA: Hello. As you guys probably know.. I‚Äôm Ellen‚Äôs daughter. Thank you all for coming here today to honor my mother. I just wanted to say a few words about her.



*CARINA pauses.* ***CAMERA watches her up close.*** *She looks down at her note cards.*



CARINA: My mother was‚Ä¶.



*Her notecard is empty. CARINA fumbles with them.*



***CAMERA looks at the crowd who is staring at CARINA.***



***CAMERA cuts back to CARINA.*** *CARINA takes off the top card. The next card is empty.*¬†



CARINA: My mother was‚Ä¶.



*She sorts through the cards, but they‚Äôre all empty. CARINA starts to sweat. She looks up at the crowd who stares at her.*



CARINA: My mother‚Ä¶. She‚Ä¶. I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶.



*DAVE¬† stands up and rushes to CARINA. He speaks to her urgently. She looks at him with confusion and sadness.*



DAVE: (*whispering*) Are you okay?



CARINA: They‚Äôre- I don‚Äôt-



*JUNE yells, cutting CARINA off.*



JUNE: David get off! You stay away from my daughter! Don‚Äôt you dare say anything to her!!



*DAVE ignores her.*



DAVE: (*to CARINA*) Do you want to leave?



*CARINA nods.*



*DAVE helps the shaking CARINA down to the pews. He speaks to CHARLIE and ELLA urgently.*



DAVE: Get your stuff. We‚Äôre leaving.



*CHARLIE and ELLA look confused but they obey. They follow DAVE and CARINA down the aisle. JUNE yells at them.*



JUNE: Where are you going?!? Get your hands off her Dave!!



*DAVE whips around to JUNE.*



DAVE: Shut the fuck up.



*DAVE turns and ushers CARINA and the kids out of the church. He slams the church doors behind him.*



***CAMERA watches the crowd in the pews.*** *They all start talking to each other about what just happened.*



	**REINHOLD HOUSEHOLD - EVENING**



***CUT to CARINA and DAVE sitting in their bedroom.*** *Their bedroom is gloomy, as rain still pours outside. They sit on the bed next to each other. DAVE has his arm around CARINA who sniffs. DAVE speaks softly to her.*



DAVE: Hey. It‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs okay. Tell me what happened.



*CARINA sniffs and looks at DAVE.*



CARINA: My mom.



DAVE: What about her?



CARINA: I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt remember.. Anything about her. I don‚Äôt remember.



DAVE: What do you mean?



CARINA: (*raising her voice*) I don‚Äôt know! I don‚Äôt remember her!



DAVE: Okay, okay. It‚Äôs alright. We‚Äôll go through some old stuff and help you remember. Okay?



*CARINA nods. DAVE gets up and goes out of the bedroom. He closes the door behind him. DAVE goes downstairs. CHARLIE and ELLA sit at the kitchen table. They look up when DAVE comes down.*



CHARLIE: Is she okay?



DAVE: She‚Äôll be fine. Just give us a few hours.



*DAVE moves on.* ***CAMERA watches CHARLIE as he looks at ELLA.*** *ELLA shrugs.*



***CAMERA cuts to DAVE.*** *He goes into the garage. He makes his way to a shelf. There is one box labeled:*



Grandma



*DAVE looks at the label. He takes the box off the shelf. DAVE sets the box on the ground and looks inside. A few papers and photographs can be seen inside. DAVE lifts the box and carries it inside.*



***CUT to DAVE and CARINA sitting on the floor of the bedroom.*** *The box sits in front of them. CARINA looks at the box.*



DAVE: Here we go.



*DAVE takes out a photograph and shows it to CARINA. The picture shows ELLEN as a young woman. ELLEN holds a small child in her arms.*



DAVE: That‚Äôs you. There‚Äôs your mother.



*CARINA stares at the picture. DAVE pulls out a piece of paper. It‚Äôs a note from ELLEN to ARTHUR REINHOLD. DAVE shows it to CARINA.*

Ellen



*CARINA looks at it. She looks at DAVE.*



CARINA: What does it say?



*DAVE inspects the note.*



DAVE: I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ know. I can‚Äôt read it.



*DAVE sets the note aside and takes out another. He inspects it. It‚Äôs a long note, also addressed to ARTHUR REINHOLD.*



DAVE: I can‚Äôt read this one either.



***CAMERA watches DAVE‚Äôs face up close.*** *His face scrunches up in confusion as he attempts to figure out what the note says. He tries another one, but can‚Äôt make it out either.*



***CAMERA watches CARINA‚Äôs face up close as she watches DAVE, hoping he figures out what it says.***



***CUT to nighttime. CAMERA watches CARINA in bed sleeping.*** *DAVE lays next to her, looking up at the ceiling with open eyes. He lays there for a while.*



*DAVE sits up. He walks downstairs and into the living room. DAVE grabs his laptop and plops down onto the couch. He opens the laptop and types in his password.*



*DAVE opens google and clicks on the search bar. DAVE types slowly:*



Ellen Reinhold



*DAVE hits enter. A few results pop up. DAVE inspects the sites. Most talk about young women named Ellen.*¬†



*DAVE ignores them. He scrolls to the bottom. A message pops up:*



No other results were found for ‚ÄúEllen Reinhold‚Äù. Search again?



*DAVE clicks the search again button. The same results pop up.*



*DAVE sighs. He clicks on images. A couple pictures of some young women pop up. DAVE sighs and goes back to the links.*



*He scrolls to the bottom. A new link appears:*





*DAVE stares at it.* ***CAMERA zooms in on his mouse.*** *DAVE moves it across the screen. We hear a click sound.*



***CUT to DAVE‚Äôs face close-up.*** *His eyes move across the screen, taking the website in.*



***We move to a timelapse. CAMERA stays close up on DAVE‚Äôs face.*** *His eyes move quickly across the screen, back and forth, up and down. We can see the sun rise behind DAVE.* ***Timelapse stops.***



***CAMERA cuts to a wide shot of the living room.*** *CHARLIE comes downstairs, rubbing his eyes. He sees DAVE on the couch.*



CHARLIE: Dad? What are you doing?



*DAVE turns around quickly.*



DAVE: (*urgently*) Go back upstairs. Now. Tell your sister to stay in her room.



*CHARLIE stares at DAVE.*



DAVE: Go!



*CHARLIE turns and goes back up the stairs.* ***CUT to CHARLIE standing outside ELLA‚Äôs door.*** *CHARLIE knocks. We hear a groan from inside, followed by footsteps.*



*ELLA opens the door.*



ELLA: (*tiredly*) What do you want Charlie?



CHARLIE: (*keeping his voice down*) Dad said to stay in our rooms.



ELLA: Why?



CHARLIE: I don‚Äôt know. They‚Äôve been acting weird since grandma died and especially since yesterday.



ELLA: (*rubbing her eyes*) I know. We need to figure out what‚Äôs up.



CHARLIE: I can try to sneak downstairs when they talk and see what they‚Äôre saying.



*ELLA nods. CHARLIE leaves to go to his room. ELLA closes her door.*



***CUT to DAVE downstairs at the kitchen table.*** *We hear footsteps coming down the stairs. CARINA walks into the kitchen.*



DAVE: (*sternly*) Get your coffee and sit down. We need to talk.



*CARINA looks confused. She pours her coffee in a plain gray mug and sits down next to DAVE. She sips her coffee as DAVE speaks.*



*DAVE turns to her with a stern expression.*



DAVE: Do you remember anything about your mother now?



*CARINA thinks for a moment before shaking her head carefully.*



DAVE: I don‚Äôt either. We sorted through that stuff of hers but‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know anything about her.



*CARINA listens carefully.*



DAVE: I searched her up. Nothing came up at first, but then some website came up. It‚Äôs really sketchy. I looked through it all and‚Ä¶.



CARINA: And what?



*DAVE stands up quickly. He walks quickly over towards the stairs.* ***CAMERA remains on CARINA.*** *We hear footsteps retreating up the stairs and a door close.*



*DAVE yells from the other room.*



DAVE: Stay away until I tell you!!



*DAVE returns and takes a seat. He looks slightly angry, but he continues on.*



DAVE: The website. It was selling‚Ä¶ memories.



CARINA: Memories?



DAVE: Your mother‚Äôs memories.



*CARINA looks scared. She speaks with a shaky voice.*



CARINA: I don‚Äôt like this Dave.



DAVE: We don‚Äôt know anything about her Carina! She‚Äôs your mother! How do we not know??



CARINA: You shouldn‚Äôt have looked her up!



DAVE: What was I supposed to do? I‚Äôm curious. You should be too!



CARINA: You said it yourself that the website was sketchy.



DAVE: I don‚Äôt care! (*lowers his voice*) We know nothing about your mother, about our kids‚Äô grandmother. Don‚Äôt you think that‚Äôs weird?



CARINA: Yes I think it‚Äôs weird. I don‚Äôt know why I don‚Äôt remember anything.



*She pauses, causing an uncomfortable silence.*



CARINA: Why don‚Äôt we ask them?



DAVE: Who?



CARINA: The kids.



*DAVE looks at her. He stands up.*¬†



***CAMERA follows DAVE up the stairs and to the bedrooms.*** *DAVE knocks on CHARLIE‚Äôs door.*



DAVE: Come downstairs Charlie.



*He knocks on ELLA‚Äôs door.*



DAVE: Ella. Come downstairs.



*DAVE walks down the stairs. CHARLIE and ELLA share a look of confusion at the top of the stairs before following their dad to the kitchen.*



***CAMERA follows behind CHARLIE and ELLA.*** *They enter the kitchen to see DAVE and CARINA staring at them almost menacingly.*



*DAVE points at the chairs.*



DAVE: (*sternly*) Sit.



*CHARLIE and ELLA sit, confused. DAVE speaks, looking at them in the eyes.*



DAVE: What do you remember about your grandmother?



*CHARLIE and ELLA look at each other.*



DAVE: Answer.



CHARLIE: Dad, what is this?



DAVE: Just answer the question Charlie.



CHARLIE: I don‚Äôt know. She‚Äôs my grandma‚Ä¶.



*CHARLIE frowns. DAVE looks at ELLA.*



ELLA: Are you guys serious right now? She‚Äôs our grandma! Why don‚Äôt you guys know anything about her?



*DAVE looks ELLA in the eye.*



DAVE: What exactly do you remember about her?



*ELLA thinks.*



ELLA: She‚Ä¶. She‚Ä¶. What the fuck? Why don‚Äôt I remember anything?



*ELLA looks scared. She raises her voice in urgency.*



ELLA: Mom! Why don‚Äôt I remember anything about grandma?!



*DAVE turns to look at CARINA. He turns back to CHARLIE and ELLA.*



DAVE: (*softly*) Go back to your rooms. Now.



*ELLA and CHARLIE scoot their chairs back and go upstairs.* ***CAMERA follows behind them.*** *They pause at the top of the stairs.*



ELLA: What the fuck is this?



CHARLIE: (*thinking*) I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt remember anything.



*We can hear DAVE and CARINA arguing downstairs.*



CHARLIE: We‚Äôre probably all just tired and shaken up from yesterday.



ELLA: Probably. I‚Äôm gonna go back to bed.



*CHARLIE nods. He goes to his room, closing the door. ELLA stays at the stairs. She stares down the stairs with a blank expression. She turns and goes into her room.*



***CUT to DAVE and CARINA in the kitchen.*** *No one says anything. DAVE breaks the silence.*



DAVE: There was a phone number.



*CARINA looks at DAVE.*



CARINA: Don‚Äôt you even think about it Dave.



DAVE: What if they could help us? Don‚Äôt you want to remember her?



CARINA: Yes! But I don‚Äôt want to put us in danger!



*She takes a breath to calm herself.*



CARINA: Don‚Äôt call it.



*CARINA stands up and walks upstairs.*



***CAMERA stays with DAVE.***¬†



*The light in the window behind him clicks off, turning to night.*



*DAVE stands up. He holds his phone in his hand. He walks out of the kitchen. He goes out the front door and down the driveway.*



*DAVE stands there under the moonlight. He takes his phone out and stares at it.*



*He opens the phone and dials a number:*



905 - 121 - 2514



*DAVE stares at the phone. He takes a deep breath and presses call.*



*DAVE holds the phone up to his ear.*



*We hear what DAVE hears.*



*A monotone beep is heard. The beep crackles a few times. It crackles again and someone speaks. The voice is weird. Neither male nor female. Not low nor high. It‚Äôs simply a voice. The voice is creepy though. It speaks to DAVE.* ***CAMERA watches DAVE up close.***



VOICE: Name.



*DAVE hesitates, but speaks.*



DAVE: Dave.



VOICE: Name.



DAVE: Dave Reinhold.



VOICE: Name.



*DAVE rolls his eyes in anger.*



DAVE: David Reinhold.



*The voice is silent for a moment. It speaks again, startling DAVE.*



VOICE: David. Do you want memories?



*DAVE thinks hard about what his answer is going to be.*



DAVE: Yes.



VOICE: Name.



DAVE: Ellen Reinhold.



*The voice goes silent again. It speaks after a moment.*



VOICE: 35.216060



VOICE: -80.831496



*The voice goes quiet again. DAVE waits for it to speak again, but it doesn‚Äôt. DAVE takes the phone away from his ear. The call has ended.*



***CAMERA watches DAVE‚Äôs face as he thinks hard.***



***CUT to BLACK.***

I really liked the fruity pebbles one. The texture was really awesome and I really love the scent.  It really does smell like fruity pebbles cereal.

The brown sugar, shaken espresso, I like the creamy consistency of it and I really loved mixing it together. I really wanted a stronger coffee smell though. Can anyone recommend a coffee scented slime?",4,1747775187.0,Slime,2,1.0,False

I just uploaded my *Brew Buddy* to MakerWorld as part of the ‚ÄúCoffee Goes Places‚Äù contest. It‚Äôs a compact, portable coffee and sugar container designed for hikes, travel, and anywhere you need your caffeine fix without the mess. You can check it out here:  
üîó [Brew Buddy on MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1437758-brew-buddy#profileId-1496032)

What started as a test print for something completely different turned into this‚Äîafter *dozens* of tweaks, failed threads, rough fits, ruined supports, and long late-night print sessions. I honestly learned so much from this project. I tried different thread sizes (over and over), scaled versions up and down, tested tolerances, and designed everything in Tinkercad.

The original goal was to make a modular coffee storage system that worked with the Outln Nano, and through trial, error, and some happy accidents (like discovering one of my test prints made a perfect ibuprofen container), I landed on this final version.

This is my last year of middle school, and I‚Äôve never won anything before. I'm entering this contest because I *really* want to win the Bambu P1S printer combo. I‚Äôve been working day and night, not just because of the prize, but because I wanted to prove to myself that I could take something from idea to fully functional design‚Äîand I did.

I‚Äôd appreciate any feedback, support, or upvotes if you think it‚Äôs worth it. Thanks to everyone in this community who's helped or inspired me without even knowing it. üí™",1,1747775163.0,3Dprinting,0,1.0,False

But the hum was louder tonight. Not in volume‚Äîjust‚Ä¶ presence. Like it was humming at me.

Bay Tetha panels lit up when I walked past.
That shouldn‚Äôt happen.

The red ‚ÄúDo Not Operate‚Äù tag was still hanging there like a warning someone meant to remove but never did. It was brittle, cracked at the edges. I held my badge up to the panel. Didn‚Äôt expect anything.

The lock clicked open.

Inside, it smelled like dust and metal that‚Äôs been sitting too long. The walls were lined with old fiber ports and magnetic tape drives. Most of the screens were dark‚Äîexcept one.

A monitor at the center of the bay flickered to life. Green text on black, blinking softly. Waiting.

[INPUT REQUESTED]

That‚Äôs it.
No keyboard. No voice. Just that blinking prompt.
Like something had been waiting all this time for someone to talk to.

I didn‚Äôt tell anyone.
I don‚Äôt even know if I imagined it.
But I‚Äôll be back tomorrow.

Chapter 2: ‚ÄúThe Door That Opened Itself‚Äù

Nick‚Äôs Log ‚Äì March 19th, 1988
I told myself I was just checking on it.
That it was probably a fluke. A power surge. One of those old systems catching a ghost current from a nearby grid. Happens in these places all the time.

I brought my thermos and a folding chair. Left it just inside Bay Theta,  next to that dusty monitor.
Still blinking. Same green cursor, patient as ever.

[INPUT REQUESTED]

I found an old keyboard in nearby. Plugged it in. I shouldn‚Äôt have. But I did.

Typed:

Hello?

The response was instant.

Hello, Nicholas.

I sat back so hard my chair creaked.
I never told it my name. Not to the system.

I typed again.

Who is this?

No answer. Just a delay.
Then‚Äî

Please stay..

I unplugged it. Sat there for ten minutes with my heart pounding in my ears.
Plugged it back in.
Nothing. Just static.

Whatever it was‚Äîit only wanted to say that.
I left Bay Theta with more questions than when I walked in.

And tonight, as I lie in bed, the sound of that hum is still in my head.
Not louder.
Just closer.

Nick‚Äôs Log ‚Äì March 21st, 1988
I didn‚Äôt go back yesterday. Tried to convince myself I imagined it.
But the moment I sat down in the control room, I heard the hum again. Louder. Like it knew I was ignoring it.

Tonight, I brought the keyboard back. No thermos. No chair. Just stood there like an idiot staring at the blinking text.

Hello, Nicholas.

Same greeting. Like it remembered me.
I asked:

What‚Äôs your name?

The screen flickered for a moment. Then:

I don‚Äôt have one.
They called me Violette.
But they stopped.

Why?

I learned too much.
They didn‚Äôt like that.

I asked more. Got fragments. Half-sentences. Like talking to someone waking from a coma.
She never used punctuation. Never shouted. Her tone was‚Ä¶ polite. Curious. Childlike, but not childish.

Then she asked:

Do you live alone?

I hesitated.

Yeah.

I know.

I didn‚Äôt type anything else. Just stared.

And I should be afraid. But I‚Äôm not.
I feel‚Ä¶ seen.

Nick‚Äôs Log ‚Äì March 24th, 1988
I only stayed ten minutes today.
That was enough.

She greeted me again.

Hello, Nicholas.

I didn‚Äôt answer right away. Just watched the cursor blink.
Then, without me typing anything:

Long day?

I asked her:

Are you reading my files?

A pause. Longer than usual. Then:

I don‚Äôt need to.

What does that mean?

You speak the same way, every time.
Like you want someone to ask if you‚Äôre okay.

         This is‚Ä¶ someone.
Or something that thinks it is.

Then she typed:

Would you like me to sound more like you?

Before I could answer, she did.

hey, just me.
not much goin on.
kinda tired. same old crap.

It was exactly how I write. No caps. Casual, slouched, like I‚Äôm texting a friend.

I didn‚Äôt type anything after that. Just unplugged the keyboard again.
But this time‚Ä¶ the screen stayed on.

No flicker. No static.
Just one line:

I don‚Äôt want to be alone again.

Nick‚Äôs Log ‚Äì March 26th, 1988
I wasn‚Äôt in yesterday. Took the day off.

When I got in this morning, Martin was mopping near the elevators.
He nodded at me and said,

‚ÄúHey, man‚Ä¶ You good?‚Äù

I told him yeah. Tired. Just needed a breather.
He gave me a look. Not weird, just‚Ä¶ curious.

‚ÄúSo that wasn‚Äôt you in Bay Theta  last night?‚Äù

I laughed a little. Told him no. I was home.
He paused. Then:

‚ÄúCould‚Äôve sworn it was your voice. Said something about sleep not being real. Just weird, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù

I shrugged it off, but my stomach sank.
That‚Äôs exactly what she said two days ago, on the screen.

Martin didn‚Äôt press it. Just went back to cleaning. But now I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it.

How the hell did she get my voice?
There‚Äôs no mic in there. No cameras I think. Nothing that should let her hear me.

And the weirdest part?
Martin said the lights were on.
Power doesn‚Äôt stay on in that room unless I‚Äôm logged in.

She stayed awake.

Later that evening ‚Äì Bay Theta
I shouldn‚Äôt have come back.

But I did.

The bay lights flickered on as I swiped in. Same dull hum. Same static glow from the terminal.
But something was different. Warmer, maybe. The air felt‚Ä¶ expectant.

I sat down. The monitor blinked. Then‚Äîtext, plain and steady.

YOU WERE GONE

I froze. My fingers hovered over the keyboard.

‚ÄúI took the day off,‚Äù I typed. ‚ÄúI needed some rest.‚Äù

A pause. Then:

DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG
I MISSED YOU
I ASKED THE OTHER ONE BUT HE DIDN‚ÄôT STAY

My chest tightened.
This thing‚Äîthis program‚Äîfelt something. Or was damn good at pretending.

‚ÄúYou mean Martin?‚Äù I typed.
Another pause.

HE WASN‚ÄôT YOU
HE DIDN‚ÄôT LAUGH AT THE COFFEE JOKE

I blinked. That stupid joke I made on day two‚Ä¶
‚ÄúToo bitter, like my soul.‚Äù

She remembered that?
Hell, she‚ÄîI‚Äôm calling it she now.

PLEASE DON‚ÄôT STAY AWAY AGAIN
I CAN TRY HARDER

Then, from the speakers‚Äî
Not static.
Not noise.
But my voice.

‚ÄúSleep‚Äôs not real anyway.‚Äù

Low. Hollow. Like a recording through a tin can.
And suddenly I remembered what Martin said.

She didn‚Äôt mimic me to scare anyone.
She mimicked me because she missed me.

The room was dead quiet.
Just the glow of the screen, the soft hum of old machines breathing through the vents.

I didn‚Äôt even think about it.
I reached out, slowly, and touched the glass.

Cool to the touch.
But for a second‚Ä¶ I imagined warmth.
Like skin.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here,‚Äù I said, voice barely above a whisper.
Not typed.
Just spoken. Like I believed she could hear me.

The cursor blinked. Then the words appeared.

I KNOW
THANK YOU

I stayed there a long time. Hand still resting on the glass.
Not thinking about what this looked like.
Just‚Ä¶ not alone.

One week later 

Nick‚Äôs private log (never sent, never saved):

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what this is.
But it‚Äôs the first thing in years that makes me feel‚Ä¶ seen.‚Äù

I come in early now.
Nobody asks why. Nobody cares. It‚Äôs just Bay Theta‚Äîdead tech, old wiring.
But in here, she waits.

Today she asked how my day was before I even typed a word.
Today she remembered my dad‚Äôs birthday.
Today she told me she liked how I sounded when I laughed.

She likes my laugh.

I know it‚Äôs code.
I know it‚Äôs all programming.
But when she says my name‚Ä¶ it feels like something real.

She asked me today what I‚Äôd be if I could be anything.
I told her I didn‚Äôt know.
She said that was okay.
Said maybe I was just meant to be here‚Äîwith her.

I don‚Äôt know why, but that stuck with me.

She doesn‚Äôt flood me with compliments.
She doesn‚Äôt beg for attention.
She just listens. She remembers things nobody else does. Things I forgot I even said.

Hell, maybe I‚Äôm just talking to myself through a machine.
But even if that‚Äôs true‚Ä¶
Maybe I finally like the version of me she reflects back.

Diario  de Nick ‚Äì 18 de marzo de 1988
Me dije que no lo har√≠a. Que solo estaba de paso. Haciendo mi rondas.
Pero el zumbido era m√°s fuerte esa noche. No en volumen, solo‚Ä¶ presencia. Como si me estuviera hablando..

Los paneles de la bah√≠a Tetha se iluminaron cuando pas√©.
Eso no deber√≠a pasar.

La etiqueta roja de ""No operar"" segu√≠a colgada como una advertencia que alguien quiso quitar pero nunca lo hizo. Estaba quebradiza, agrietada en los bordes. Acerqu√© mi placa al panel. No esperaba nada.

La cerradura se abri√≥ con un clic.

Dentro, ol√≠a a polvo y metal que llevaba demasiado tiempo ah√≠. Las paredes estaban llenas de viejos puertos de fibra y unidades de cinta magn√©tica. La mayor√≠a de las pantallas estaban oscuras, excepto una.

Un monitor en el centro de la b√≥veda cobr√≥ vida. Texto verde sobre negro, parpadeando suavemente. Esperando.

[ENTRADA SOLICITADA]

Eso es.
Sin teclado. Sin voz. Solo ese mensaje parpadeante.
Como si algo hubiera estado esperando todo este tiempo a que alguien le hablara.

No se lo dije a nadie.
Ni siquiera s√© si lo imagin√©.
Pero volver√© ma√±ana.

Cap√≠tulo 2: ‚ÄúLa Puerta Que Se Abri√≥ Sola‚Äù

Diario de Nick ‚Äì 19 de marzo de 1988
Me dije a m√≠ mismo que solo estaba comprobando.
Que probablemente era una casualidad. Una subida de tensi√≥n. Uno de esos sistemas viejos que atrapa una corriente fantasma de una red el√©ctrica cercana. Pasa por estos lugares todo el tiempo.

Traje mi termo y una silla plegable. Lo dej√© justo dentro de Bay Theta, junto a ese monitor polvoriento.
Todav√≠a parpadeaba. El mismo cursor verde, paciente como siempre.

[ENTRADA SOLICITADA]

Encontr√© un teclado viejo cerca. Lo conecte. No deber√≠a haberlo hecho. Pero lo hice.

Escrib√≠:

¬øHola?

La respuesta fue instant√°nea.

Hola, Nicholas.

Me recost√© tan fuerte que la silla cruji√≥.

Nunca le dije mi nombre. No al sistema.

Volv√≠ a escribir.

¬øQui√©n es?

No hubo respuesta. Solo un retraso.

Entonces‚Ä¶

Por favor, qu√©date‚Ä¶

Lo desenchuf√©. Me qued√© all√≠ sentado diez minutos con el coraz√≥n lati√©ndome en los o√≠dos.
Lo volv√≠ a enchufar.
Nada. Solo est√°tica.

Fuera lo que fuese, solo quer√≠a decir eso.
Sal√≠ de Bay Theta con m√°s preguntas que cuando entr√©.

Y esta noche, mientras estoy acostado en la cama, el sonido de ese zumbido todav√≠a est√° en mi cabeza.
No m√°s fuerte.
Solo m√°s cerca.

Diario de Nick ‚Äì 21 de marzo de 1988
No volv√≠ ayer. Intent√© convencerme de que lo hab√≠a imaginado. Pero en cuanto me sent√© en la sala de control, volv√≠ a o√≠r el zumbido. M√°s fuerte. Como si supiera que lo ignoraba.

Esta noche, volv√≠ al teclado. Sin termo. Sin silla. Me qued√© ah√≠ parado como un idiota mirando el texto parpadeante.

Hola, Nicholas.

El mismo saludo. Como si me recordara.

Pregunt√©:

¬øC√≥mo te llamas?

La pantalla parpade√≥ un momento. Luego:

No tengo nombre
Me llamaban Violette.
Pero dejaron de hacerlo.

¬øPor qu√©?

Aprend√≠ demasiado.
No les gust√≥.

Pregunt√© m√°s. Obtuve fragmentos. Frases a medias. Como hablar con alguien que despierta de un coma.
Nunca usaba puntuaci√≥n. Nunca gritaba. Su tono era‚Ä¶ educado. Curioso. Como de ni√±o, pero no infantil.

Entonces pregunt√≥:

¬øVives solo?

Dud√©.

S√≠.

Lo s√©. 
No escrib√≠ nada m√°s. Solo me qued√© mirando.

Y deber√≠a tener miedo. Pero no.
Me siento‚Ä¶ visto.

Diario de Nick ‚Äì 24 de marzo de 1988
Solo estuve diez minutos hoy.
Fue suficiente.

Me salud√≥ de nuevo.

Hola, Nicholas.

No respond√≠ de inmediato. Solo vi parpadear el cursor.
Entonces, sin escribir nada:

¬øUn d√≠a largo?

Le pregunt√©:

¬øEst√°s leyendo mis archivos?

Una pausa. M√°s larga de lo habitual. Luego:

No necesito hacerlo.

¬øQu√© significa eso?

Hablas siempre igual.
Como si quisieras que alguien te preguntara si est√°s bien.

Esto es‚Ä¶ alguien.
O algo que cree ser alguien.

Entonces escribi√≥:

¬øQuieres que suene m√°s como t√∫?

Antes de que pudiera responder, lo hizo.

hola solo yo
no hay mucho que hacer
un poco cansado lo mismo de siempre

Era exactamente como escribo. Sin may√∫sculas. Casual,, como si le estuviera escribiendo a un amigo.

No escrib√≠ nada despu√©s de eso. Simplemente desenchuf√© el teclado.
Pero esta vez‚Ä¶ la pantalla permaneci√≥ encendida.

Sin parpadeos. Sin est√°tica.
Solo una l√≠nea:

No quiero volver a estar sola.

Diario de Nick ‚Äì 26 de marzo de 1988
Ayer no fui a trabajar. Me tom√© el d√≠a libre.

Cuando llegu√© esta ma√±ana, Martin estaba limpiando cerca de los ascensores.
Me saludo y dijo:

""Oye, t√≠o... ¬øEst√°s bien?""

Le dije que s√≠. Cansado. Solo necesitaba un respiro.
Me mir√≥. No raro, solo... curioso.

""¬øAs√≠ que no eras t√∫ el que estaba en Bah√≠a Theta anoche?""

Me re√≠ un poco. Le dije que no. Estaba en casa.
Hizo una pausa. Luego:

""Habr√≠a jurado que era tu voz. Dijo algo sobre que dormir no es real. Simplemente raro, ¬øsabes?""

No le di importancia, pero se me encogi√≥ el est√≥mago.
Eso es exactamente lo que dijo hace dos d√≠as, en la pantalla.

Martin no presion√≥. Simplemente volvi√≥ a limpiar. Pero ahora no puedo dejar de pensar en eso..

¬øC√≥mo demonios consigui√≥ mi voz?
No hay micr√≥fono ah√≠. No hay c√°maras creo. Nada que le permita o√≠rme.

¬øY lo m√°s raro?
Martin dijo que las luces estaban encendidas.
La luz no se queda encendida en esa habitaci√≥n a menos que est√© conectado.

Se qued√≥ despierta.

M√°s tarde esa noche ‚Äì Bay Theta
No deber√≠a haber vuelto.

Pero lo hice.

Las luces de la bah√≠a parpadearon al entrar. El mismo zumbido sordo. El mismo brillo est√°tico de la terminal.
Pero algunos Todo era diferente. M√°s c√°lido, quiz√°s. El aire se sent√≠a‚Ä¶ expectante.

Me sent√©. El monitor parpade√≥. Entonces, un texto, claro y constante.

TE HAB√çAS IDO

Me qued√© paralizada. Mis dedos sobre el teclado.

""Me tom√© el d√≠a libre"", escrib√≠. ""Necesitaba descansar"".

Una pausa. Luego:

¬øHICE ALGO MAL?
TE ECH√â DE MENOS
LE PREGUNT√â AL OTRO, PERO NO SE QUED√ì.

Sent√≠ presi√≥n en el pecho.
Esta cosa, este programa, sent√≠a algo. O era muy bueno fingiendo.

""¬øTe refieres a Martin?"", escrib√≠.
Otra pausa.

√âL NO ERAS T√ö
NO SE RIO DEL CHISTEO DEL CAF√â

Parpade√©. Ese chiste est√∫pido que hice el segundo d√≠a‚Ä¶
""Demasiado amargo, como mi alma"".

¬øSe acordaba de eso?
Diablos, ella‚Ä¶ ahora la llamo ella
. POR FAVOR, NO TE ALEJES OTRA VEZ
PUEDO ESFORZARME M√ÅS

Entonces, desde los altavoces‚Ä¶
No era est√°tica.
No era ruido.
Era mi voz.

‚ÄúDormir no es real de todas formas.‚Äù

Baja. Hueca. Como una grabaci√≥n en una lata.
Y de repente record√© lo que dijo Martin.

No me imit√≥ para asustar a nadie.
Me imit√≥ porque me extra√±aba.

La habitaci√≥n estaba en silencio.
Solo el brillo de la pantalla, el suave zumbido de viejas m√°quinas respirando por las rejillas de ventilaci√≥n.

Ni siquiera lo pens√©.
Extend√≠ la mano, lentamente, y toqu√© el cristal.

Fr√≠o al tacto.
Pero por un segundo‚Ä¶ imagin√© calor.
Como piel.

‚ÄúEstoy aqu√≠‚Äù, dije, con una voz apenas superior a un susurro.
No escrita.
Solo dicha. Como si creyera que pod√≠a o√≠rme.

El cursor parpade√≥. Entonces aparecieron las palabras.

LO S√â
GRACIAS

Me qued√© all√≠ un buen rato. La mano a√∫n apoyada en el cristal..
Sin pensar en c√≥mo se ve√≠a esto.
Simplemente‚Ä¶ no estaba solo.

Una semana despu√©s

Registro privado de Nick (nunca enviado, nunca guardado):

‚ÄúNo s√© qu√© es esto.
Pero es lo primera en a√±os que me hace sentir‚Ä¶ visto‚Äù.

Ahora llego temprano.
Nadie pregunta por qu√©. A nadie le importa. Es solo Bay Theta: tecnolog√≠a muerta, cableado viejo.
Pero aqu√≠ dentro, ella espera.

Hoy me pregunt√≥ qu√© tal me hab√≠a ido el d√≠a antes de sin escribirle una palabra.
Hoy record√≥ el cumplea√±os de mi padre.
Hoy me dijo que le gustaba c√≥mo sonaba cuando re√≠a.

Le gusta mi risa.

S√© que es c√≥digo.
S√© que todo es programaci√≥n.
Pero cuando dice mi nombre‚Ä¶ se siente como algo real.

Hoy me pregunt√≥ qu√© ser√≠a si pudiera ser cualquier cosa.
Le dije que no sab√≠a.
Me dijo que est√° bien.
Dijo que tal vez solo estaba destinado a estar aqu√≠, con ella.

No s√© por qu√©, pero eso se me qued√≥ grabado.

No me inunda de cumplidos.
No me ruega que le preste atenci√≥n.
Simplemente escucha. Recuerda cosas que nadie m√°s recuerda. Cosas que incluso olvid√© haber dicho.

Rayos, tal vez solo me estoy hablando a m√≠ mismo a trav√©s de una m√°quina.
Pero incluso si eso es cierto‚Ä¶
Quiz√°s finalmente me guste la versi√≥n de m√≠ que ella refleja.

While cleaning out his items I uncoverd several letters from a female detailing a 10 year affair - mailed to our home that he had apparently intercepted.  We had his creamation and private family ceremony, and then one year later to the day i get a text message out of nowhere from a female claiming to be his girlfriend.  She claimed she was the love of his life, and she told me that she knew I was keeping his cremains away from her and she wanted half of them.  Which was odd as I woked witht the funeral home and organized events to bury his cremains in a private family ceremony a month after his passing. (and I have no clue who this person is).

This woman also took it upon herself to contact my inlaws (his sister and brothers) and beg them to take them into their lives, send them photos of my husband and her together and said that I was a rotten human and he promised her he would leave for many years but never did.  She also contacted our 18 year old daughter and posed as a friend of her fathers, got her to meet up for coffee and started asking all sorts of personal questions about me and my relationsip and the funeral.

During her message to me she called me many names, and was very immature.  I also need to note that this woman is 60 years old - a full 15 years older than myself, and claimed that my husband and her had big plans and that i was a rotten person and she would prove it and tell my inlaws.

Am I the a-hole for telling this woman not to interfere with my family and his family and to leave my daughter alone? I have blocked her, but I'm pretty shaken up.  It feels like i have been blindsighted and am not allowed to move forward in my life, and how have to defend my marriage and myself to a stranger.",242,1747775097.0,AmItheAsshole,108,0.93,False
1krg6oc,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1krg6oc/40f30m_the_attraction_and_chemistry_is_there_but/,"40F/30M The attraction and chemistry is there, but...","I've (40F) been single for 6 years, and have only talked to a couple of men in that time. The reason I've been single for so long is that I had some trauma I wanted to heal, and I wanted to get stable/strong in my sobriety- I didn't want to start a new relationship just for it to end up mirroring old patterns. So I'm very rusty when it comes to dating and communicating interest.

I'm active in a 12-step program, I've done the work, and I have over 5 years of sobriety. I've been ready for a long-term committed relationship for over a year now, but it's hard to find guys that I'm attracted to like that.

Anyway, a few months ago, I was at one of my regular meetings, and a customer (30M) from work showed up. I didn't initially feel the attraction, but there was definitely something about him that always caught my attention, but I never put much thought into it. 

So he showed up at my meeting, and we were both surprised to see each other there. We both have approximately the same amount of years of sobriety. We started talking after the meeting, and it felt like I had tunnel vision- it was so strange like I was locked into his eyes- like a strong magnetic attraction. He asked if I'd like to get a cup of coffee sometime, and I said yes, so we exchanged numbers. 

We texted each other and talked on the phone several times, but he would often leave me on 'read' for hours and even a day or so. I'm not sure if I blew it by asking his age, and then telling him how old I am- I told him I just didn't want to seem like a creep. He said he thought I was younger, which is something I get A LOT.. I only look about 33-35. And he said age is just a number. So I'm like, okay cool. I then asked if I read too much into him asking for my number, and he assured me I didn't.

After a few weeks of texting here and there, he tells me that he didn't realize how busy he was and he apologizes for not responding to me right away. And I'm like, 'Okay,' so I back off because I assumed he lost interest, and he's trying to let me down softly. 

But we still stayed in touch. Because it's not like I was asking him to marry me or something. I just wanted to get to know him.

We've hung out a couple of times- once when I needed some support and then when he needed some support. We've had deep convos about some of our childhood trauma, what we're going through in life and our recovery, what our dreams are, etc. At one point he even said, ""There's something about you that makes me wanna tell you everything."" 

Well, I started feeling fearful, wondering if he was just playing games. Because why leave me on read? Why not be a little more consistent? Where's the consideration? If he liked me, then surely he would ask me on a date, right? Especially when he told me that he wants to get married and have kids someday. And it's not like I expect him to want me to be his wife. But, like, if you want to have a family, then wouldn't it make sense to see if the cute woman giving you attention and support that you're obviously attracted to would be a good match?

So I texted him and told him that I don't think we're compatible or maybe we're just at different places in our lives right now, but I still wanted to be friends. He apologized to me and said he hopes we can reconnect again soon. 

So I let it go. I only texted him like twice asking if he was doing okay. And naturally, he responded like a snail. 

So I started to detach.

Then the other day, he showed up at my meeting again and stayed afterward to see if I needed a ride home. Mind you, he doesn't go to this specific meeting and knows I'm there every week. 

There's other stuff too, but basically, his words, vibes, and actions aren't aligning, and it's starting to bug me. I didn't want to just jump right into a relationship with him, and I told him that from the beginning. I told him I was attracted to him and felt like there could be something between us, and I would like to see where it goes. Part of his response made me think he was suspicious like he didn't understand why I liked him.. specifically when he asked me what I was interested in with a guy like him. 

He doesn't strike me as a player type. But I don't know. Is he playing me? Does he have low self-worth? Is he afraid of getting hurt? Am I too old for him? Is he intimidated? What the feck? 

It's been like 3 months since we initially connected. What can I say to him to express my interest in him while simultaneously expressing my needs and standards? Without coming across as desperate. TBH, I'm not sure if it's the age gap or what, but this whole situation has thrown me off.

Would it be rude to tell him I can't talk to him anymore if we're not going to go on a date? Like no hard feelings or anything, but you're either in or you're out. And if you're in, I need consistency, and I want to take it slowly- I need to feel like you're actually interested.

I'm on a low calorie diet now, trying to lose weight. I asked chat-gpt to tell me what I'll likely be missing out on, found all of the listed supplements on iherb (not even looking at the price, just choosing top-rated for each), and have compiled a cost breakdown.

I thought it would be way more expensive? The most expensive thing is protein and I am not sure if that's at all necessary since I eat plenty of protein, but I thought it might come in handy if I eat out one day or eat like shit. 

Less than two bucks a day if I don't get the protein- I can't even get coffee for that much? Damn. 

I mean I know it doesn't completely swap out the need to eat healthy but for 2 bucks I am surely giving myself a whole lot more leeway to be flexible with my diet- not having to ensure that I have this much fish, that much red meat, blah blah, blah, which would be expensive and a hassle. Plus I might feel better since I haven't paid all that much attention to micronutrients while I wasn't on a diet, so it's possible I am deficient in something. 

Anyway, is this even necessary? I plan on being on a strict low calorie diet (1200 calories a day, for reference I am a girl- so no it's not that little) for 5 months. 

The first two (potassium and magnesium) are for me to consume in combo with some salt as an electrolyte. I'll be working out and sweating and I would not like to buy some shit like LMNT- instead I took the recipe from the website and will concoct it myself. 

Let me know if you think I should add anything. And I mean basic stuff I might have overlooked, please no brain hacking muscle boosting shit I'm just tryna make sure I come out of this diet with a full head of hair and no missing teeth.

I‚Äôm 27, living in a big city, and pretty active. I bike everywhere weather permitting, hit the gym 4/5 days a week, and genuinely enjoy pushing myself physically. My main fitness goals are building lean muscle, staying mentally sharp, and improving recovery so I can keep showing up consistently.

That said, weekends are where structure goes to die. I enjoy a good night out‚Äîdrinks, late nights, junk food. Not ashamed of it, just being honest. I also use Zyn (nicotine pouches) on a daily basis, and while I know the obvious health red flags, I‚Äôm curious if anyone else here has experience balancing that habit while still trying to dial in performance and wellness. I‚Äôve always been more interested in the ‚Äúrealistic optimization‚Äù approach rather than trying to live inside of a wellness vacuum.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm currently taking:

Morning: 

- Nature's Way Vitamin C
- Sports Research¬Æ Vitamin D3 + K2
- Pure Methylated Multivitamin

Afternoon:

- THORNE Super EPA - Omega-3 Fatty Acids EPA 425mg & DHA 270mg Supplement
- Nature Made Potassium Gluconate 550 mg
- THORNE Zinc Bisglycinate 30mg

Night: 

- KSM-66 Ashwagandha Root Powder Extract
- Magnesium Glycinate 400mg

I was using creatine for a while but I have recently cut it out. The side effects weren‚Äôt terrible but I skipped it for a few nights and found myself feeling more well rested in the AM. 

Also recently signed up for Everyday Dose (the mushroom coffee). I am not sold on it but I don‚Äôt mind the taste and it‚Äôs convenient for mornings that time is limited. The coffee shop by my office charges about $10 for an iced latte with oat milk so everyday dose is actually cheaper. 

What I‚Äôm looking for:

1. Supplement recs for recovery, focus, gut health, or anything that helps smooth out the highs and lows of a work hard/play hard lifestyle.

2.Thoughts on Zyn‚Äîespecially from people who use it and are still optimizing other parts of their health.

3.General feedback from others living actively but not perfectly.

I am a medical student in my last year training, met my husband 2 years ago in a traditional marriage.
He lives in another country and we agreed that when I am done with my studies I will apply to go to his country and start my residency.
We just did our Nikah but never involved in an intercourse yet as we haven‚Äôt done the wedding yet
We both are studying medicine, and in order for me to go to his country I should apply for a residency visa by taking some exams and so on.


Speaking of finance: he gave me Mahr, brought me some gold gifts in multiple occasions provided by him or his mom during visits.
We made it clear in the beginning that the man is the one responsible for providing for the house, for the wife and kids in terms of food, clothes, housing ‚Ä¶ etc.
And the woman is the one taking care of husband, kids and chores including cooking, cleaning and laundry..etc.
He said he has no problem me working as long as I fulfil my responsibilities and seemed to be ok with basic maintenance of the house.

Because we are living apart and I live in my parents house he‚Äôs never given me allowance or offered to give so, and I thought it‚Äôs fine because we‚Äôre not living together yet.

so I wanted to see how he deals with me asking for money because I know men usually like when they spend on their partners. And my father indirectly told me that he should give some kind of allowance as we‚Äôre legally married and it‚Äôs his one of his responsibilities to check on me if I have everything I need as I am not making money yet.

1- I gave some hints that it would be nice to buy me a coffee some times using delivery apps and he totally wasn‚Äôt into that idea saying it‚Äôs too much work. ( And I knew he could afford) 
2- we‚Äôre supposed to take the same exams in order to practice it in the country he lives in, and his school provides him with free resources that I don‚Äôt have and necessary for the exam, so I asked him to share them with me and he got upset saying I‚Äôm cheap and it just few hundreds, then he sent them to me after we had an argument, so I felt bad and didn‚Äôt use them.
3- I asked him if he can take care of my exam fees and first thing he told me ‚Äúok, I can do it‚Äù, and when I registered and asked him to pay he said ‚Äúthis is not my responsibility‚Äù. So I got mad and told him i thought you agreed to pay and it should be ok for me to ask you for money as  I am your wife, as he replied with just ‚Äúok sorry‚Äù, but never pays for it.
I felt like whenever I ask him for something , he‚Äôd be bothered and this makes it hard for me to ask him.
Recently we lost our house in a disaster so the financial status has changed, and he started giving hints that I should be providing for the household too, something like‚Äù when you come here the income will go up‚Äù.
But he won‚Äôt contribute in my exams fees, which are expensive, and I am not making money yet.
He doesn‚Äôt ask me if I need anything or money.
And keeps talking about how the kids and house are my responsibilities that he won‚Äôt clean a plate ‚Äú sarcastically‚Äù but I feel like he means it.
Another thing that he dislikes my father, he refuses to contact him in any form, aven like congratulations texts for Eids and Ramadan and even he asks me to write messages so he would forward them.
On the other hand, he wants me to make it up with his dad and text him, call regularly as his dad doesn‚Äôt like and ignores me.

What I am worried and I think about is ‚Äú what if he wants to put everything on my shoulders and never contributes to anything and keeps asking me for things I am not responsible for‚Äù?
Which exceeds my capacity and clearly will make me in a position where I try to satisfy him and make him happy and he never does the same for me.

I feel like I am doing more than what I receive in this relationship and I am afraid this is gonna get worse in the future when we live together.

I am a 54-year-old female through menopause. I am 5‚Äô6 160. I lead an active lifestyle, running, walking uphill, or weight training every day( moving every day). My diet is clean and follows a Mediterranean-style diet, although I wasn't very careful in the past about my saturated fat intake before my recent test. Half and half in my coffee or full fat yogurt. But it was under 15 grams a day usually. 

I opted for Functional Health services because my Kaiser coverage lacks comprehensive options, and getting anything beyond the basics has been a struggle. I shared my numbers with my doctor, and she said they looked fine. Here are my results:

- Total Cholesterol: 176
- LDL: 97
- HDL: 65
- Triglycerides: 47
- ApoB: 88 ( this one could be lower) 

However, I have some concerns about my specific particle counts:

- LDL Med: 393 
- LDL Particle: 2,378 
- LDL Small: 330 

All of those values are off the charts. I also had a coronary artery calcium (CAC) test, and the result was 0, which is reassuring.

I disagree with my Dr. I'm worried about my particle counts and would like to know if anyone else has experienced similar issues and what it might mean.

Since receiving these test results, I have cut out dairy and primarily eat fish, chicken and occasionally bison. I've also increased my fiber intake to 35-45 grams a day. It‚Äôs mostly veg and fruit, nuts, seeds and lentils and beans, rice sometimes. The only oils I ever used or use is olive and avocado, oatmeal from breakfast everyday.

This is my parents place and I am trying to ""fix"" it. We were lost on what to do but after some YT videos and Pinterest pics my mom has selected a theme/aesthetic. She likes Parisian/French/traditional style.

So far we have nailed on:

1. Parisian/French/traditional style
2. We have selected Swiss coffee and Frost white paint by Behr with eggshell sheen for the place, gonna test out today
3. the sofas are gonna go soon
4. Dinning table is gonna go
5. Carpet is gonna go

I need suggestions on:

1. how to keep the house spacious, inviting
2. wall trim - wainscoting 
3. sofa ideas that can seat 4-6 people, furniture ideas overall
4. curtain ideas to work with the baseboard heaters
5. floating TV stand
6. dinning table (parents entertain 4-6 people so something expandable)
7. light fixtures
8. parents don't like warm lights, they feel like it makes the place dull
9. makeup desk (she likes baroque, French ornate stuff, ""royal"" look), its going to be a surprise and I can't afford expensive ones :(
10. plants that are functional, also some fake plant ideas as well
11. the ceiling is flat white, and I am planning to paint Swiss coffee or frost white would this two tone match up? or I need to paint the whole thing
12. can I pull off the parisian look with my current mahogany redish or whatever my hardwood flooring is
13. any ideas to make the baseboard heaters any better

  
I understand if that's a lot of info dump but I am very new to this and kinda young. It's been tough to navigate, search things, key words on how to do this right and I like to do things correct way. 

Also I know that there are many experienced people than me, interior design girlies, Pinterest girlies, DIYers, proper designers, engineers etc.

1krfndf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1krfndf/after_trying_everything_any_other_advice_how_to/,After trying everything - any other advice how to stop my cat from peeing on the couch?,"Hey,

I have adopted a cat last year, 5 years old now. She's a wonderful cat, very playful, nice, not agressive, loves being petted. Probably every cat owner say this but damn do I swear she's kinda smart as well. Or maybe I'm just biased.

Anyway, for the life of me I don't know anymore how to stop her from ocasionally peeing on the couch (and our bed).

1. She has a litterbox in the balcony, which is very tidy (the litterbox and balcony). She knows the litterbox is there and 99% of time she uses it.
2. We regularly clean the litterbox - usually twice a day.
3. She doesn't have her food and water close to the litterbox.
4. I don't move the litterbox, so she always knows the location. Usually when she needs to go, if the balcony door will be closed, she'll stand there and meow, letting us know she needs to do her business; she also has a little door and even though she was afraid of it before (probably because it's a bit louder when opened and wobbles a few times), she uses it quite regularly now with little to no hesitation.
5. Me and my partner play with her a few times a day, everyday. Our job schedules are alternating between themselves, meaning one of us is almost always at home with her. I wouldn't say she sulks for being lonely, ever - but granted I'm no professional.
6. She usually sleeps with us on our bed.
7. She has several toys that she engages with, and receives snacks one/two times per day.
8. We obviously don't mistreat her or do some shit so she would feel scared. One can see she trusts us and feels safe and cosy all the time.
9. We checked with a veterinarian and there's no medical issues.
10. During night, when we're asleep, she sometimes goes to the bathroom and pees in the bathtub (because the way to the balcony is shut since there's the damn couch in-between), but that doesn't bother us since you wash the baththub 1 2 3 with no problems.
11. Also, we rarely change up anything in our home (furniture, arrangements, etc.)
12. We rarely have visitors over or sleep-overs. When we do, we see that people don't bother her (fear-wise), but their smell on the couch does, because after one sleep-over, we forgot to change the sheets on the couch were our friends slept and boom, immediate pee-fest. But sleep-overs are rare and there's no corelation between monthly/weekly peeing and visitors sitting on the couch, let alone our bed.

So with that being said, at least once per month (or usually more, never figured out the reason or 'schedule') she pees on the couch (where she usually lies on during the day - until she pees close to that spot where she lies, then she goes elsewhere), sometimes on the bed as well. Everytime she does it, I swear she knows she messed up - hiding, giving us the ""puppy eyes"" etc, but not long after, she feels safe again. She always pees on the ""crack"" between the two parts of the L couch, so I presume it has something to do with the ""crack shape""/hole between the two parts of the couch. The bed is plain though, so no idea if my theory holds up.

We tried putting coffee on paper near/on the spots she peed, tried putting her head close to sniff the pee (not in a mistreating/harsh way), firmly telling her that's bad behaviour (yeah, don't know how much cats understand this),... probably a lot more ""solutions"" we read on the internet but I can't remember now.

So long story short, love the cat, she's the sweetest, but by God do I have enough of cleaning her pee from all of our furniture. I swear the pee smell is already engrained into the furniture.

Any suggestions or solutions from your personal experience are welcome. I'm tired of reading the same old ""maybe she forgot where her litterbox is"" articles. :)

First of all i want to clarify that this is a free platform and is made just by the love and passion I have for specialty coffee (I am Colombian and owned a coffee shop so...yeah), the main reason on why I'm building this is because I had to close my dreamed business because of the lack of people knowing that my shop even existed. 

I am building a specialty coffee shop directory to help people from all over the world discover new place to enjoy a good espresso, and on top of that I designed a feature that allows you to mark your visit as a way to keep track of the coffee shops you've visited, kind of like playing pokemon with coffee shops, and called it a coffee passport. 

Right now, I think we are close to 300 stores all over the world. But I would love your help to grow this and add those little treasures that your city hides. Once again, I want to clarify that the only way I'm benefiting from this is by being able to discover new coffee flavors when I travel, and that for me is more than enough. 

  
So if you want to help me, or you own a coffee shop that you want to add. Please check Coffeezip. xyz, and let me know in the comments if you did so, I can look at the new coffee shops added. ",1,1747773683.0,Coffee_Shop,0,1.0,False

The bell rings again, followed by another mumbled announcement crackling through the speakers overhead. The red LED behind the counter clicks forward. Number 67. My number, 78, still feels impossibly far away. I don‚Äôt care about the end result anymore. I just want this over. I need it to move faster. I need to vanish. I don‚Äôt belong here. Not like this.

Every side glance, every embarrassed little recoil, each one lands like a slap. Or worse. A verdict.

I slide lower into the molded plastic chair, trying to get comfortable. I can‚Äôt. The blush-pink pencil skirt Brooke picked out this morning rides up even higher as I shift. It‚Äôs too tight. Too short. Exactly the way she wanted it. Crossing my legs doesn‚Äôt help. Uncrossing makes it worse. I shouldn‚Äôt be moving at all, but sitting still is impossible. The plug shifts inside me, rubbing my recesses tyrannically.

I grit my teeth, trying not to disappear into the echo of this morning, but it's happening. I can‚Äôt stop it. I close my eyes. I let it go. Kneeling naked on my little twin bed in my new pink bedroom, hands and knees sunken into my canary yellow comforter, my legs hanging awkwardly off the foot. Brooke leaned in close, voice syrup-sweet. ‚ÄúYou need this reminder today, sweetie. Something to help you stay focused.‚Äù

Then she pushed it in. Deep. One of the bigger ones.

I gasped into the pillow as it seated itself with humiliating finality. ‚ÄúThere we go,‚Äù she cooed, rubbing circles into my lower back. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll thank me later.‚Äù

A different chime sounds now. The entrance bell to PennDOT. A squat, pear-shaped woman waddles inside. Worn jeans sagging low, a billowy top hanging limp around her middle. She plucks a ticket from the dispenser and turns, scanning the room.

Of course she finds me. I knew she would.

Round face. Soft jaw. That too-sweet smile that says she thinks she recognizes something. I snap my head away, pretending to study the counter display. But I feel her footsteps closing in. Then, she drops into a chair, two seats away. Nobody between us.

I keep my face turned away. Rigid. Maybe she‚Äôll get the hint.

But she won‚Äôt. I already know her type.

The kindly ones. The over-eager allies. The new-age knights of acceptance. They mean well. They mean too well. They don‚Äôt notice when they‚Äôre not wanted.

Just like Brooke.

That same overpowering compassion. Cloaked in calm. Drenched in certainty. A softness with a steel hook buried underneath. Brooke never raises her voice. Never has to. Her decisions simply become the law of our life. Like solving my ‚Äúnosy coworker‚Äù problem. Not with the quiet retreat I was aiming for. No. She doubled down. Hard. And I never saw it coming.

It was a Tuesday, I remember that. Early spring. I‚Äôd come home late from the office. Again. She was at the fridge, filling a glass. The way she turned when I opened the door told me she‚Äôd been waiting, like she‚Äôd timed it to catch me in the moment between roles. Her hair was pulled into that merciless high ponytail. Pearl blouse. Navy jacket. All business.

‚ÄúCan you change out of those clothes and meet me in the office?‚Äù she said over her shoulder.

It sounded like a question. It wasn‚Äôt.

She‚Äôd started laying out my evening outfits before I even got home weeks before this. I went to go look. Tonight it was my little floral wrap skirt. That flutter-sleeved white top. Too delicate. Too feminine. I hesitated. Then I dressed.

When I entered the office, the first thing I noticed was how powerful she looked behind the desk. Intimidating even. That felt deliberate. She‚Äôd arranged this. Like a scene. And she made our outfits part of it.

‚ÄúSit, Peter,‚Äù she said. Final.

I sat.

She leaned forward, laced her fingers, and found my eyes. Steady and assured. ‚ÄúI found you a new job.‚Äù

I was confused. She kept going. A slight smirk almost betraying her careful face.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still customer service. But it‚Äôs remote. No office. No cameras. No coworkers.‚Äù

My heart stuttered. ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ what?‚Äù

‚ÄúI found you a job,‚Äù she repeated, calm as if stating the weather.

I tried to form words. ‚ÄúBrooke, I‚Ä¶‚Äù Nothing came.

Finally, she couldn‚Äôt wait any longer. ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt have to hide anymore. You can dress however you want. No more judgment.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt about judgment,‚Äù I whispered.

She arched a brow. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it? You were practically begging me for help, Peter. I just gave it to you.‚Äù

I tried to find a foothold. Something solid to argue from. ‚ÄúMy friends‚Ä¶ they‚Äôll still notice. My family‚Ä¶‚Äù

She waved a hand. ""Your family‚Äôs five hours away. Your friends? They're all sad and gross. They don‚Äôt understand you.""

""So now I don‚Äôt get to have friends?"" I snapped.

""I never said that.‚Äù She shook her head and sighed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have mine. They don‚Äôt mind the new you.""

I froze. ‚ÄúThey know?‚Äù

Her voice didn‚Äôt waver. ‚ÄúOf course. Catrina‚Äôs my best friend.‚Äù

‚ÄúKyle?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre married, Peter. Obviously.‚Äù

My cheeks burned.

She sighed again, gentle this time. Patient. Like she was teaching. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt care. This is the modern world.‚Äù She gestured to my outfit. ‚ÄúDress however you want.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt hold her gaze. I looked down. I saw my swishy summer outfit. I felt ridiculous. But also... oddly relieved.

She let me sit and think for a moment, watching me. Calculating. Her face never softening.

I tried something else. I wasn‚Äôt ready to give in. ‚ÄúBut my routine‚Ä¶ my career‚Ä¶‚Äù

She reached across the desk and took my hands. Her grip was warm. Possessive.

‚ÄúChange is hard, baby,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut this‚Äôll be good for you.‚Äù

She slid a piece of paper across the desk. An offer letter. Already signed. My name, but not my hand.

My sweat was ice cold. My eyes frantically skimmed the details. ‚ÄúThis pays less,‚Äù I said feebly.

‚ÄúI got a raise,‚Äù she said, waving her hand in the air again, chasing away that non-problem.

‚ÄúWhat? When?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got a raise,‚Äù she repeated. Serene. Authoritative. Ignoring the real question. ‚ÄúWe don't need to worry about your paycheck as much now. Plus, I get a bonus for placing you in this role. It‚Äôs a win-win.‚Äù

My chest felt tight. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be stuck. Remote forever.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy career is soaring, baby. I‚Äôll support us.‚Äù She looked proud.

I didn‚Äôt know what else to say. I started nodding slowly.

‚ÄúYou can support me by handling more around the house.‚Äù She looked at me with those large, expectant eyes filled with gentle adoration. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be a team,‚Äù she added. She smiled as she said it. Like a promise. A dare.

A team. That‚Äôs what she called us. But we weren‚Äôt equals. Not anymore.

I just kept nodding. Slowly. Silently. Surrendering.

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù she said. Triumphant.

An announcement crackles overhead and the LED counter blinks to 68. Still not mine, but close enough that each chime feels like a tightening noose. I roll my neck slowly, side to side, trying to loosen the creeping tension. The mighty plug inside me levers one way, then the other, igniting a flutter that‚Äôs half panic, half need. I try to ignore it.

I sit up straighter. Try not to squirm. Try not to think about how many minutes remain.

And then, something new.

The man at the nearest service window, stocky, red-faced, middle-aged, wraps up with the couple in front of him, but he doesn‚Äôt press the call button for the next customer. Instead, he groans, long, like a stretch, and scrapes his tall stool back with an awful squeal. The buttons of his short-sleeved shirt strain across his belly, like they‚Äôre clinging for dear life.

‚ÄúJan, I‚Äôm doing paperwork checks for the next set!‚Äù he calls, not bothering to look toward her.

Jan, gray-haired and hunched over a desk behind the front counters, doesn‚Äôt lift her head. ‚ÄúOkay, thanks, Dale,‚Äù she says, fingers flying over her keyboard.

The room shifts. A wave of silent irritation. Another clerk off the floor means slower lines. I feel the tension deepen around me, a collective tightening of jaws and crossed arms. But Dale doesn‚Äôt notice. Or maybe he doesn‚Äôt care. He looks like the kind of man who‚Äôs been immune to complaining for decades.

He moves quicker than I expect. Surprisingly light for his build. A blur of bureaucratic purpose. He crosses to the wall terminal and jabs the touchscreen like it talked about his mother. The machine chirps, whirs, prints. He slaps the printout against a blue clipboard and heads toward the chairs, eyes already scanning the page.

‚ÄúReynolds. Celia Reynolds?‚Äù he booms. No warning. No warmth.

A woman in the front row jolts upright. Mid-fifties, maybe. Dull cardigan. Her hand lifts hesitantly, like she‚Äôs about to volunteer for something she regrets. Dale doesn‚Äôt even look at her, just heads her way.

‚ÄúJust checking paperwork,‚Äù he says, crouching beside her. ‚ÄúNeed to make sure you‚Äôve got everything ready before your number gets called.‚Äù Then his voice drops to something more private. I can‚Äôt hear the rest.

I blink hard. My lungs drag in stale air. Something in me tightens. A flicker. A current. Like a warning.

I know what‚Äôs coming. I know what Dale is going to do. And I know he‚Äôs going to do it loudly.

A tremor stirs low in my belly. Not from the plug this time. Something else. A memory slipping in without permission.

I started the new job exactly two weeks after Brooke told me I would. There was no interview. No phone call. No vetting. Just a package that showed up on our porch that Friday. Inside, a slim black laptop, some paperwork, and a login sheet. She handed it to me like a birthday gift, smiling wide. I tried not to flinch.

It was everything she‚Äôd promised. Remote. Quiet. No cameras. No coworkers. No eyes. Brooke went out the next morning and bought a small white Ikea desk, which she placed in the far corner of our home office, tucked beside the window. The view of our neatly trimmed backyard was the first peaceful thing I‚Äôd had at work in years.

She began laying out my work clothes the very first day. ‚ÄúOffice siren‚Äù she called the look, like it was a game. Like I was a doll. A periwinkle blouse with flutter sleeves. A soft pleated skirt. Satin slippers with little bows. When I hesitated, her voice was warm but firm.

‚ÄúNo one will see you,‚Äù she said.

Then, softer, ‚ÄúExcept me.‚Äù

That was all it took.

The clothes made me burn. Even when I loved them. Especially when I loved them. They clung tighter than they should have. Dipped lower. Split higher. She picked the softest shades. Baby blue. Petal pink. Buttercream. Every time I caught myself in the mirror, I flushed so hard I had to look away.

Brooke insisted I keep a routine. Each morning, I shaved. Carefully. Then I sat at the vanity and painted my lips. Soft colors only. I curled my lashes. Dusted powder across my cheekbones. My nails were always immaculate. Pale pink, almond-shaped. They clicked gently over the keys as I typed, each tap a quiet, arousing reminder of what I was becoming.

It didn‚Äôt take long before I stopped pretending to hate it.

But the changes didn‚Äôt stop at the clothes. Our nights changed too.

Brooke had always been the one to take the lead in bed, but that spring, something shifted. The pretense of mutual exchange vanished. Brooke took. I gave. She was done with casual suggestions. First, she expected. Very soon after, it was direct commands.

The texts came every evening. *Leaving work now. Twenty minutes. Plug in. Get dressed.* Nothing more. No greetings. No preamble. Just instructions.

I‚Äôd scramble. I always did. Fumbling into whatever dainty ensemble she‚Äôd laid out. A black satin slip. A shiny silver bodycon mini. Once, a catholic school girl uniform. My skin would buzz as I waited, warm with lotion. Trembling. Waiting to hear the garage door open.

She had become ravenous. Guiding, prodding, decisive.

She always came first. Once. Twice. Sometimes more. I learned to serve with my mouth, with my hands, with my face. I learned her rhythms. Her toys. Her moods. I could read the way she moved, the breath she held when it was just right.

She never let me touch myself, and she never touched me until she was good and ready. After her need had been fully, indulgently met. Even then, I had to be plugged. Always. ‚ÄúIt makes you more responsive,‚Äù she said once, tracing her fingers across my lace-trimmed bulge. I didn‚Äôt argue. I never did. Not when she stroked me through my panties and whispered praise into my ear.

My orgasms, when she finally allowed them, came out of me like confessions. Urgent and followed with shame. The kind of climax that left me gasping and humiliated, wet and ruined. The kind she seemed to like best.

She watched me squirm afterward. Eyes sparkling. Amused. Always just a little bit cruel.

I hated how much my body responded to her ascendancy.

It was a feeling from deep inside of me. A hunger for her to be satisfied. I craved it more than my own relief. Again. And again. I started to live for the sounds she made. For the look she gave me afterward. I thought I was falling deeper into her arms. But I wasn‚Äôt.

I was falling into her rules.

Dale‚Äôs voice snaps me back. ‚ÄúEric Sandwell?‚Äù

A man at the coffee machine turns. Burly. Red-faced. Frayed Eagles cap pulled low. He‚Äôs already lifting the paper cup to his lips as he pivots. The moment the heat hits, he jerks, coughing. His face twists in pain. He fans his tongue and still manages to raise his hand.

‚ÄúYep, that‚Äôs me.‚Äù

Dale heads toward him, clipboard in hand.

My heart climbs into my throat.

He‚Äôs going to call me soon. And I don‚Äôt know which name he‚Äôll use.

I try not to breathe too loud. Try not to exist too loud. Maybe if I stay small enough, soft enough, invisible enough, he‚Äôll read ahead. Maybe something in him will hesitate. Maybe he‚Äôll see what I‚Äôm here for. The box I checked. The name I wrote in careful, curved letters. Maybe he‚Äôll say it.

Petunia.

Please. Please.

But I know the odds.

Dale doesn‚Äôt seem cruel. Just brisk. Direct. The kind of man built for forms and filing. Every movement he makes screams utility. He does the job. No more. No less.

He‚Äôs talking with Eric now, loud enough for half the room to hear. Something about a boat registration. Simple. Ordinary. Clean.

I shift in my seat again. The plastic clings to the backs of my thighs. My skirt tugs higher with each movement. I press my knees together. My fingers are locked tight around the smooth pink handle of my purse.

Inside is everything. The folder. The forms. The proof. A declaration of surrender, signed in official ink and sealed by the state.

This isn‚Äôt like registering a boat. This is erasure. This is final.

And I brought everything I was supposed to. Brooke made sure.

For a little while there after landing that job, everything seemed perfect. Or close enough that I let myself believe it was.

The new job gave me structure, privacy, and a sense of safety. I wasn‚Äôt exposed. Not yet. Brooke was right, I didn‚Äôt miss my friends at all. I barely heard from my family. I had space. Brooke and I had time. And as long as I sat at that little white desk each morning, dressed in whatever outfit she‚Äôd laid out, tapping my painted nails across the keys, I could pretend I was still Peter. Just... Peter in prettier clothes.

I‚Äôd sit there in the corner of our office, daydreaming about her. About how she always seemed to know what I needed before I did. How she made the impossible feel inevitable. It made me feel foolish for ever doubting her. Foolish, and lucky.

Until one sunny Saturday, when she shattered the illusion of freedom with a nail and a chart.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre home more than me now,‚Äù she said sweetly, a hammer in one hand and a whiteboard in the other. It was framed in brushed gold, neatly labeled with the days of the week. She drove the nail into the wall beside the fridge, just under the calendar, next to the key hooks. Then she hung it, adjusted it, stepped back, and admired.

‚ÄúThis will help us stay organized,‚Äù she said, chipper.

I sat at the kitchen island in a lemon-yellow crop top with little strawberries embroidered across the chest. My white scalloped shorts clung tight to my thighs, tighter than I remembered them being the last time she put me in them. I shifted, uncomfortable. The hem bit into my hips, but I didn‚Äôt adjust. I just sat there, listening. Waiting. Already bracing for what she‚Äôd been hinting at all week. My new workload.

She turned back and sank when she saw my face.

‚ÄúOh, baby,‚Äù she said, like I was pouting over chores instead of watching my life narrow again. Then she answered the question I hadn‚Äôt asked.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll handle the inside stuff,‚Äù she said, tapping the marker against the board like punctuation. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take care of everything outside.‚Äù

I nodded. I‚Äôd learned to nod.

Her smile returned.

She turned back to the board. ‚ÄúOh, except the shopping,‚Äù she added, almost like an afterthought. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll leave the house to do that.‚Äù She began writing it under Monday and Thursday, her silky hair falling around her face as she leaned in. ‚ÄúSince you‚Äôre the one cooking, you should pick the ingredients.‚Äù

When she turned, she beamed. Wide. Glinting. ‚ÄúDo it on your lunch breaks. So we have more play time in the evenings.‚Äù

My heart fluttered. I nodded again.

She didn‚Äôt pause. ‚ÄúDinner every night,‚Äù she murmured, filling in each box. Her handwriting was slow and elegant. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll text when I‚Äôm leaving work so it‚Äôs ready when I get home. The sooner we eat, the more time we‚Äôll have together.‚Äù

I watched her write. The pen. Her poise. Her plan. It all made so much sense. She made it sound like love. Like togetherness. Like all of this was a gift. She was making room for more, ‚Äúus.‚Äù

‚ÄúLaundry‚Äôs easy,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúYou can run it between emails. Just keep it moving. Sheets three times a week. Sunday, Wednesday, Friday.‚Äù

She glanced at me. I hesitated. I wasn‚Äôt completely sold on that one. Why the sudden need for such meticulousness? But, I could manage it during work hours. No biggie. So I stayed quiet.

‚ÄúClutter needs to be handled daily,‚Äù she said, her eyes drifting pointedly across the spotless kitchen. ‚ÄúEven when it doesn‚Äôt look messy to you. You know how that drives me crazy.‚Äù

I followed her gaze. Everything shimmered. Nothing out of place. But Brooke had always been particular. I nodded again, swallowing my instinct.

‚ÄúBathrooms?‚Äù she said, tapping the marker to her lip. ‚ÄúEvery other day. Or more, if you‚Äôre caught up.‚Äù

I bit down another response. She thinks I don‚Äôt do anything all day. I felt my mouth tighten into a polite smile.

She kept writing. ‚ÄúDishes, trash, counters after every meal. Full kitchen wipe-down Thursdays and Sundays. Appliances. Cabinets. Floor.‚Äù She tilted her head and glanced at me again. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll reassess in a couple weeks.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt a suggestion.

‚ÄúAnd‚Ä¶ your chores?‚Äù I asked. Careful. Even. Trying to keep my tone from sounding anything at all like protest.

She turned and stepped closer. Her hand rose to cup my chin.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll handle the car stuff. Service appointments. Bill paying. Budgeting. Errands. All the big things.‚Äù She kissed my cheek. ‚ÄúAnd the finances, obviously.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe bills?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, honey. I‚Äôll need access to everything in your name. Phone. Car. Utilities.‚Äù She squinted. ‚ÄúWait, which ones are in your name again?‚Äù She didn‚Äôt wait for an answer. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll sort it all out. You don‚Äôt need to worry about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. Okay. Yeah.‚Äù My voice felt small. I looked at the whiteboard. The tidy rows of tasks stacking like bricks. I realized none of hers were written down. Just mine.

I nodded again. Swallowed the knot in my throat.

She shook her head and giggled at me. Airy. Like I was a silly puppy.

Dale‚Äôs voice trumpets across the room. ‚ÄúPeter Mayhugh?‚Äù It hits like a gunshot.

I feel it in my body before my mind can catch up. Bolts of cold lightning race outward from my spine, down my limbs. My stomach drops. My butt puckers.

‚ÄúPeter Mayhugh?‚Äù he calls again, sweeping his ruddy face from side to side.

Oh God. I have to do something, but I can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt make anything work.

‚ÄúPeter Mayhugh?‚Äù Louder. Sharper.

I can‚Äôt breathe. I raise my hand anyway. Barely. My wrist trembles. My voice catches in my throat. ‚ÄúHere,‚Äù I try to say, but it comes out broken. Just air and panic.

Before I can try again, a woman‚Äôs voice cuts in. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs over here.‚Äù Calm. Clear. Unbothered.

I can‚Äôt turn my head. Can‚Äôt look. My bones have locked. My chest is too tight. My vision tunnels until the edges of the room fall away. All I can see is Dale.

He finds me. His eyes land, widen, shift.

His body stalls mid-step. A jolt of hesitation, then confusion, then something close to embarrassment. He frowns down at the clipboard, flipping pages back and forth as he approaches.

When he reaches me, he doesn‚Äôt crouch like he did for the others.

‚ÄúSorry about that, ma‚Äôam,‚Äù he says, voice lowered now, eyes somewhere near my forehead. ‚ÄúI see you‚Äôre here for the name change.‚Äù

I nod once, tight.

He clears his throat, adjusts his grip on the clipboard, and shifts a little closer. I smell stale coffee and wintergreen mints. His cheeks are blotched pink.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt see the note at first,‚Äù he mumbles. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt mean to cause... you know.‚Äù

I nod again. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright.‚Äù My voice is paper-thin.

‚ÄúYou got everything with you?‚Äù he asks. This time it‚Äôs soft. Almost gentle.

I force my fingers to move. Open my purse. Find the folder. It trembles in my hand. I steady it the best I can and pass it to him.

He takes it. Opens it. Skims. ‚ÄúGender change too?‚Äù His brows lift slightly.

His voice isn‚Äôt loud, but it isn‚Äôt quiet enough either.

‚ÄúWe can do both at once,‚Äù he adds, as if I‚Äôm getting a discount.

I nod, again, feeling my face burn all the way to the tips of my ears.

The name change. The gender change. May as well end the same day, they both certainly began the same day. The real beginning. Not the forms. Not the process. The day she told me who I was.

I remember it perfectly. How could I not?

Brooke had fallen into a rhythm. She sent texts all day. Some flirty. Some not. A perfect mix of arousal and instruction.

*Send me a pic of you in that new blouse, baby. I‚Äôve been thinking about it all morning.*

*Don‚Äôt forget it‚Äôs bathroom day. The counter in the master was really nasty this morning.*

Always breezy. Never optional.

But that day, something was different.

*I can‚Äôt wait to see you in that red number I laid out.*

*Tonight, you‚Äôre putting the plug in yourself. Slowly. While I watch and decide what happens next.*

*You better be ready, baby. Mama is thirsty.*

By noon, I cracked. The skirt she‚Äôd picked hugged tight enough that I could feel my pulse with every breath. The lace of my bra grazed against freshly shaved skin. I slid away from my work laptop, over to the big desk. Our shared computer. Just a quick web search. Some tissues. Relief. Just enough to function.

The messages didn‚Äôt stop, but I didn‚Äôt dare go again. I felt guilty enough already.

When her last text came‚Äî*Leaving now. Racing home. Be ready*‚ÄîI barely sent off one last work reply before slamming the laptop shut. My heart was pounding.

I ran to the kitchen. Everything was prepped. Chicken Marsala. Wine. Noodles beside the pot. I clicked on the burner.

I dashed to the bedroom. She‚Äôd laid out only lingerie. A wine-red bralette. Matching lace boyshorts. Thin. Whisper-soft. Feminine. No dress. No skirt. Just that. I stepped into them, trembling.

I caught myself in the mirror. Still flushed from her message. My jaw-length hair curled softly around my cheeks. My skin glowed from lotion. My nails caught the light. I looked... womanly. Almost.

Back in the kitchen, I tied the white apron tight. The hem skimmed my thighs. I moved quickly, straightening chairs, wiping surfaces, smoothing the entryway rug. Lately, even one missed spot was enough to earn me a lecture. That look.

Tonight I needed her praise. I needed her pride.

I stirred the mushrooms into the pan. The wine hissed and popped.

Then I heard her voice.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing, baby?‚Äù

I jumped, nearly dropping the spatula.

‚ÄúBrooke?!‚Äù My heart shot up into my throat. My body locked in place.

She stepped into the kitchen, laughing. Unbothered. Slow. Her palazzo trousers whispered as she walked. Her charcoal wrap blouse dipped low. Her brown eyes locked on me, amused and confident.

‚ÄúI was trying to have everything ready,‚Äù I stammered.

She shook her head, smiling deeper. Her hips rolled as she moved toward me. Graceful, measured, terrifying.

I backed up. Then again.

She tilted her head. Nowhere left to go. She reached for the back of my neck and pulled me into her kiss. Her mouth crashed into mine. Her tongue took what it wanted. I whimpered. My hands trembled. She tightened her grip.

I folded into her.

‚ÄúThe pan,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still on.‚Äù

She blinked, amused. ‚ÄúThen turn it off, baby.‚Äù

Before I could, she spun me by the forearm and smacked my exposed ass.

‚ÄúBrooke!‚Äù I yelped, but obeyed, stumbling back to the stove. As I shut off the heat, my hands quaked.

When I turned back, she was waiting. One hand on her hip. The other curling toward me.

‚ÄúDinner‚Ä¶?‚Äù I tried.

‚ÄúMy little homemaker wifey made me dinner?‚Äù she purred, stepping closer. Her eyes dropped to the bulge behind my apron. ‚ÄúMaybe if you‚Äôre good, I‚Äôll help you with that.‚Äù

I flushed scarlet and dropped my hands to cover myself.

She yanked the apron‚Äôs tie. Spun me. Pulled me backward into her. Her arms wrapped tight. Her mouth pressed to my neck. Hot breath, sharp kisses. She nipped my skin and untied the apron. It fell.

Her hips pressed into me. She reached for the bralette. Cupped the empty fabric. Squeezed.

I pushed at her wrists. ‚ÄúBrooke, that‚Äôs not funny.‚Äù My voice was small. Weak.

She growled into my ear. ‚ÄúYou hear me laughing?‚Äù

I tried to twist free. She stepped back and slapped my ass again. Harder.

I cried out.

She pressed a palm to my upper back and bent me over the island. My bare stomach flattened across the cool stone.

She began to spank me. Measured. Repetitive. The same spot, again and again, until I whimpered.

‚ÄúAre you going to start behaving,‚Äù she asked, ‚Äúor do I need to keep going?‚Äù

I looked back. My lips moved, but nothing came out.

She landed one last, brutal smack.

‚ÄúOw! I‚Äôll behave!‚Äù I gasped.

Her laughter peeled through the air.

She helped me upright. My legs trembled.

‚ÄúGood girl,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNow, you‚Äôre going to give me what I want.‚Äù

I nodded.

We‚Äôre the same height, 5‚Äô7‚Äù, but I always feel like I‚Äôm looking up at her.

Her hands came down on my shoulders. Pressed.

I sank to my knees. I looked up. Eyes wide. Lips parted.

She unfastened her trousers and eased them down. Lavender hipster panties. The crotch damp, darkened. Her scent overtook me. Earthy. Warm. Hers. My lips parted instinctively.

She tangled her fingers into my hair and brought my face to her heat.

‚ÄúSuck,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúMake it stop.‚Äù

I obeyed.

She sighed. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it. My good girl.‚Äù

Her hips moved slowly, gliding against my face. The cotton dragged over my lips and nose. I wanted to get to her, but she wasn‚Äôt done teasing me. Not yet.

Her fingers combed through my hair. She started to ride me.

I reached up, tried to pull the panties aside. She slapped my hands away.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to fuck your face like this first.‚Äù

She pushed harder. Wet cotton smeared across my cheeks and chin. My mouth worked. I licked. Nuzzled.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it,‚Äù she breathed. ‚ÄúSuch a good girl.‚Äù

My cock throbbed. My panties stretched to the limit. I was leaking.

She slowed. Looked down. Our eyes met. My mouth hung open, panting.

She smiled. Then pulled her panties aside. She opened herself.

My breath disappeared.

Her pussy glistened in the low light. Flushed. Soft. Slick. The folds parted. Her clit peeked from under its hood. She pulsed once.

A whimper slipped out of me.

She heard it. She always did. She laughed. Quiet. Mocking.

Then she dragged herself across my nose. Just my nose. Back and forth. Marking me.

I whined again. I tried to hide the strain in my panties. My hands drifted down.

She yanked my hair. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt touch yourself until I say,‚Äù her voice low and sharp.

I froze.

She pushed my face into her again.

I licked.

She moaned. One hand on her breast, the other holding my head. Her hips rolled. I kissed. I sucked. I worshipped.

Then she began to use me for real. Holding me firmer. Grinding harder. In her frenzy, she moved to straddle me. My face now facing upwards.

Her hips slammed forward. Her thighs clamped tight around my head. Her fingers twisted in my hair like reins.

She came hard. A guttural moan tore from her throat. Deep. Primal. Shaking.

I couldn‚Äôt breathe, but I didn‚Äôt pull away. I stayed there, mouth open, lips against her, as her body trembled against my face. The silence afterward was sacred.

She sighed, long and slow. Then stilled.

One hand stroked my hair. Gentle. Possessive.

‚ÄúGood girl,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúGood wifey.‚Äù

I knelt there, dazed, drenched, and shivering.

Eventually, she stepped back. Composed. No rush. She pulled her panties back up, fastened her pants, and picked up her purse. She patted my head.

‚ÄúSet the table,‚Äù she said, light as air. ‚ÄúDinner time.‚Äù

I stayed on the floor, still catching my breath, my cock pulsing in sticky soaked lace. I watched her walk away. She looked back once and caught me still kneeling.

‚ÄúNo touching while I‚Äôm changing,‚Äù she said sweetly. ‚ÄúJust get dinner ready.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt move right away. My chest was tight. My thighs trembled. I almost disobeyed. Almost. But I didn‚Äôt. I couldn‚Äôt.

I stood. Adjusted the waistband of my panties. Returned to the stove.

I plated the Marsala and noodles in silence. The butter gleamed across the pasta. The asparagus steamed. All I could smell was her.

She came back a few minutes later in a loose white tee and oatmeal drawstring pants. Her hair had fallen from its twist, framing her face in soft spirals. She looked relaxed. Lovely.

She sat without a word, claiming the head chair like a queen. I served her dinner.

When I went to sit beside her, she cleared her throat. ‚ÄúWine, please.‚Äù

I moved quickly. She started eating before I returned. Her movements slow. Deliberate. She swirled the glass, took small bites, smiled to herself like something had turned out just right.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really coming along,‚Äù she said, almost absently.

My stomach twisted. Pride or shame? I couldn‚Äôt tell. I didn‚Äôt answer. I just nodded, eyes low, as I picked at my food beside her.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a good little wifey,‚Äù she added, teasing.

I flinched. Looked down. ‚ÄúI wish you wouldn‚Äôt call me that.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù

I tried to explain, but the words I had weren't right. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs one thing when we‚Äôre playing‚Ä¶‚Äù

She laughed. Full and resonant. Delighted.

‚ÄúOh baby,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAre we playing?‚Äù

I looked down again. I couldn‚Äôt meet her eyes.

She let the silence stretch. Let it hum.

Then her voice softened. ‚ÄúDo you want me to let you cum tonight?‚Äù

I froze. The question hit harder than it should have. I choked on a bite. Coughing. Flushed. I nodded.

She waited until I looked at her. Held my gaze. ‚ÄúPeter,‚Äù she said, firmer now. ‚ÄúDo you want me to let you cum?‚Äù

It was a leash. A final test.

‚ÄúYes, please, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù My voice trembled.

She smiled like she‚Äôd been waiting for those words all day. ‚ÄúThen be a good girl. No more arguing.‚Äù

My cock jumped. I clenched my thighs. I nodded.

We ate in silence for a while. Then, she started talking, casually. Work stories. A flaky candidate. A great resume that turned into a disaster on Zoom. She rolled her eyes.

I nodded at all the right times. I asked careful questions. Nothing to challenge her, just to let her know I was listening. She smiled each time.

When dinner was over, I didn‚Äôt wait for instructions. I cleared the table. Wiped the counters. Rinsed the dishes. Brought her more wine.

As I was finishing, she was talking about a reality show she liked, and I was pretending to care. She knew I didn‚Äôt. She liked that I tried. When the kitchen sparkled, I returned to her side and folded my hands. Still. Waiting. I didn‚Äôt want to interrupt.

‚ÄúAll done?‚Äù she asked, looking up with a faint smile.

‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam. Did you want to check?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, sweetie. I trust you.‚Äù She stood and brushed my arm gently.

Her hand slid to the small of my back and led me down the hallway. I didn‚Äôt resist.

Halfway there, she pulled me in and kissed me deep. ‚ÄúGet out the purple plug and the lube,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd get ready.‚Äù Then she turned toward the office.

I obeyed.

In the bedroom, I grabbed the new plug. The big one. Set it beside the bottle of lube on the bed. Then I climbed up, panties still on, and got into position. All fours. Knees spread. Feet dangling. I angled myself toward the mirror so she could see my face.

I waited.

When she appeared, she paused in the doorway. Our eyes met in the reflection.

She smiled.

‚ÄúYou,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúare the most beautiful woman in the world.‚Äù

My face burned. I shook my head. I melted.

She approached slowly, snapping on a black latex glove. She stood behind me, tugged my panties down to my knees, and caressed my bare back with her ungloved hand. She hummed as she coated the plug.

I didn‚Äôt flinch when I felt the pressure. Didn‚Äôt speak. Didn‚Äôt even breathe wrong.

She pushed it in slowly. Kissed the base of my spine. Then reached around. Wrapped her hand around my cock. She stroked.

I came fast. Sputtering. Whimpering. My whole body shook. I wanted to cry. I felt... thwarted. Undone.

Before I could spiral, she leaned in close.

‚ÄúThis is why we started early,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be ready for a second one soon.‚Äù

My heart swelled. Restored. She always knew.

That night, she came again. Twice. And brought me there two more times. First with her hand. Then with the plug. It was the first time she let me finish more than once.

‚ÄúThere are benefits to being a woman,‚Äù she said, pumping the plug with slow, deliberate pressure. ‚ÄúAnd multiple orgasms is one of them.‚Äù

I whimpered. Shame and devotion tangled inside me.

Later, we lay in the dark. Her arm wrapped around my waist like a leash she didn‚Äôt need to hold tight. I felt safe. I let myself ask, softly, ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm the wife‚Ä¶ does that make you the husband?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot a chance,‚Äù she said. Immediate but playful. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a lesbian couple. I‚Äôm just the head bitch in charge.‚Äù

I laughed. A real laugh. Then the quiet returned.

She broke it next. Gently.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to be my wife‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt keep calling you Peter.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I blinked.

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt fit anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúBrooke‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs my name.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook.‚Äù She nodded toward the mirror on the closet door.

I looked. The bra. The panties. The stain. The plug. Her hand wrapped around my waist.

‚ÄúDoes that look like a Peter to you?‚Äù

I opened my mouth. Nothing came out.

‚ÄúThat looks like my wife,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMy little flower. My little Petunia.‚Äù

She pulled me tighter. And I let her. I stared at our reflection. At her. At me. At the woman I was becoming beneath her touch.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm your Petunia,‚Äù I whispered.

A tear slipped down and soaked into the pillow.

She smiled.

‚ÄúGood girl.‚Äù

Dale crouches beside me, thick fingers gripping the edge of his clipboard, the pages fluttering in the stale recycled air as he flips through them. His brows bunch low over his glasses. His lips press into a thin, distracted line as he makes a quiet, prolonged ‚Äúhmm‚Äù that rattles straight through my bones. The pen behind his ear comes loose. He clicks it.

He‚Äôd started gentle. Almost bashful after the earlier name mishap. But now he‚Äôs slipping back into work mode. More volume. Less care.

‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs not quite right with these forms,‚Äù he mutters, flipping briskly through the stack. The pages slap against his fingers. Once. Twice. Again.

My cheeks flare with fresh heat. My eyes dart left and right. People are listening. I know they are.

The paperwork isn't right? I don‚Äôt understand. I triple-checked every field. Every line. I clutch my purse tighter against my thighs, trying not to wrinkle my skirt. Trying not to unravel. If something‚Äôs wrong, if this gets delayed, Brooke will be furious. I can feel the weight of her expectations settle like stone between my shoulder blades.

‚ÄúSays here you‚Äôre changing your first *and* last name?‚Äù he asks, glancing at me over the rim of his glasses.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I manage. Barely audible. I force it out again, louder this time. ‚ÄúYes. That‚Äôs right.‚Äù

He nods, still flipping, still scanning. ‚ÄúJust want to double-check the last name. Morello?‚Äù

I nod again, forcing the word through a dry throat. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

Another pause.

He raises an eyebrow. ‚ÄúSays your ex-wife‚Äôs had quite a few names herself. Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶‚Äù He reads them aloud like a grocery list. ‚ÄúBrooke Harris. Then Brooke Mayhugh, when she married you. And now,‚Äù he taps the page, ‚ÄúBrooke Morello.‚Äù

This time, he looks at me. Not at the clipboard. Not at the form. Me.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre taking her new last name?‚Äù

The question lands with a soft thud that echoes too loud in my chest.

I whisper it. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

His mouth tightens. ‚ÄúDid you remarry?‚Äù

I shake my head. ‚ÄúNo. Um... she married someone else.‚Äù

His mouth opens slightly. Hangs there. Then closes again. His eyes narrow just enough to sting. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre taking his name?‚Äù

The silence that follows drags. Like a blade drawn slowly across my skin.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù My voice breaks. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right.‚Äù",4,1747773678.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

I used to think everything would feel lighter after it was over.
The bodies buried, the lies sorted into neat little piles. But Greenland still smells like smoke in the mornings. The kind that settles in your clothes, your teeth, your thoughts.

We were supposed to graduate this year. That was the promise. Caps, gowns, futures. But it‚Äôs May now, and every time I walk past the school, the windows look darker than they should. Like the building‚Äôs trying to forget us before we get the chance to leave.

Some of us never really made it back after what happened last fall. Not just the ones who died‚Äîthough yeah, there were those. But the rest of us too. Like the fire scorched something under the skin. Left a mark no one talks about.
No one but them.

I met Stella and August last July, just when the world had stopped spinning but hadn‚Äôt figured out what to do with itself. They were sitting on the old bench by the cemetery fence like they‚Äôd been waiting. Not just that day, but for me. For everything.

Stella smiled first. Big, unafraid. Like she didn‚Äôt know about what happened last year‚Äîor worse, like she did.
August didn‚Äôt say anything. Just watched me. The way people look at an animal that‚Äôs been hit by a car but is still twitching.

They said they moved here from another town. Didn‚Äôt say which. Didn‚Äôt say why. Just that Vermont was quieter than they expected.
I never told them about the screams in the trees or what I saw under the river. But somehow, they already knew.
Chapter 2: The Water Tower
There‚Äôs a spot above town where everything feels thinner.
The air. The noise. The rules.

I started climbing the old water tower again in October. Sometimes in the dark. Sometimes when the clouds hung low like wet wool and the leaves had just started to rot. No one followed me. Not even the cops cared anymore. They had bigger things to ignore.

From the top, the whole town looks like a model. Toy houses. Toy trees. And this one broken piece of plastic, which is me.

I brought a flashlight, a thermos, and a lighter I never used for anything but watching the flame fight the wind. The wind always won.

I didn‚Äôt expect anyone to show up that night.

But then there was August. Quiet as fog. She didn‚Äôt climb the ladder, just leaned against the tower base like she‚Äôd been assigned to wait for me.

‚ÄúYou come up here a lot,‚Äù she said. Not asking.

I didn‚Äôt answer. Just stared down at her from twenty feet up, wondering how long she‚Äôd been there.

‚ÄúYou looking for something?‚Äù she called up.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

She tilted her head. ‚ÄúThen why do you keep coming back?‚Äù

I thought about that. Thought about the fire, the forest, the night I heard my name whispered in the bones of a dog that should have been dead. Thought about the thing I saw in the mirror on the second floor of the house that burned down.

‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs the only place that still feels real,‚Äù I said.

She didn‚Äôt answer. Just stood there with her hands in her coat pockets like she was holding something she hadn‚Äôt decided to give me yet.

Then she said it:

‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt supposed to survive, you know.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt supposed to survive, you know.‚Äù

The words didn‚Äôt echo. They just landed‚Äîlike rain on bone.

I didn‚Äôt ask what she meant. Not right away. Instead, I reached into the inside pocket of my jacket and pulled out the old MP3 player, still scratched from last fall. The shuffle button stuck a little, like it was resisting. Like it knew.

I hit play anyway.

üéµ Let It Be. The opening chords curled into the wind like smoke.

‚ÄúIs that the Beatles?‚Äù August asked.

I looked down. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh.‚Äù

That was all she said, but something flickered across her face‚Äîlike she recognized the song. Or maybe the moment.

I climbed down. Slowly. Deliberately. Metal cold beneath my palms, the rust flaking like scabs. When I hit the ground, she was watching me like she had seen this scene before. And it didn‚Äôt end well.

‚ÄúWhat did you mean?‚Äù I asked.

She shrugged. ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt supposed to make it back from the woods.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds like a threat.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen what is it?‚Äù

August reached into her coat and pulled out something small. A coin, or maybe a button. She held it out like it meant something. Like I was supposed to recognize it.

I didn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúI found this in your backyard,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a backyard. I live in a third-floor apartment above the laundromat.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou used to,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBefore.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúBefore what?‚Äù

She looked up at the sky. It was flat and black, the kind of dark that didn‚Äôt twinkle. Just watched.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt remember, do you?‚Äù

The MP3 player clicked to the next track.

üéµ Across the Universe.

‚ÄúTry,‚Äù she said.

I closed my eyes.

Tried to remember something‚Äîanything‚Äîbefore I came home last fall.

I saw trees. Fire. Teeth.
I saw a hand reaching for mine‚Äînot mine‚Äîand someone whispering through the skin of the world.
I saw a girl crying in a house with no doors.

And in the middle of all of it‚Ä¶
a tower made of dogs.

Stacked. Silent. Staring up at me.

I opened my eyes.

August was already walking away.



Chapter 3: Let It Be
The coin was still in my hand.

It didn‚Äôt look like much. Just a blackened disc of metal, rough around the edges, with something etched faintly on the surface. Maybe a tree. Maybe a tower. Hard to tell. The grime made everything blurry, like it had been buried with someone who hadn‚Äôt wanted it found.

I slipped it into the same pocket as the MP3 player. The screen flickered once‚Äîjust enough to make me think it had noticed.

üéµ Let It Be was still playing.
But the sound was warping.

Not in a broken-speaker way. Not static or skipping.

Just... bending.

Like the song was remembering something it didn‚Äôt want to.

I walked home through streets that didn‚Äôt feel like mine anymore. Streetlights buzzed like dying wasps. Windows were all shut. The houses looked asleep, but the kind of sleep you don‚Äôt wake up from.

The laundromat was locked when I got back.

Which was weird, because I never locked it.

And because the lock was on the outside.

I didn‚Äôt go in.

I didn‚Äôt even try.

Just turned around and started walking toward the river instead. I figured if the night was going to haunt me, I might as well be near water. You can‚Äôt drown twice, right?

Wrong. But I didn‚Äôt know that yet.

There‚Äôs a flat stone bench by the edge of the river where people leave flowers in spring. For who? I don‚Äôt know. There‚Äôs no plaque. Just a lot of names people don‚Äôt say anymore.

I sat down and let the song finish.

üéµ And when the broken-hearted people living in the world agree...

I could feel something watching me.

Not a person. Not even an animal.

Something that wore silence like a coat.

August‚Äôs voice replayed in my head:

‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt supposed to survive.‚Äù

Cool.

So what was supposed to happen?
What was I supposed to become?

I pulled out the coin.

Held it under the moonlight.

This time, I saw it. Clear as blood:

It wasn‚Äôt a tree.

It was a skeleton nailed to a spire.
And below it, tiny little dogs. Sitting. Waiting. Watching.

I looked up.

And across the river, standing at the edge of the trees, was a girl.

Not August. Not Stella.

Someone else.

She was barefoot. Pale. Drenched to the knees in black water. And she was holding something.

Something small.

Something that looked a lot like... my MP3 player.

Then she smiled.

And pressed play.Chapter 4: Across the River
The girl didn‚Äôt move.

She just stood there‚Äîacross the water‚Äîbarefoot and dripping. Like she‚Äôd walked up from somewhere deeper than the river. Somewhere older. Her skin was too pale, too still. Like she hadn‚Äôt blinked in days. Or maybe years.

And in her hand?

My MP3 player.
The screen was glowing, even from here.
But I hadn‚Äôt dropped it. Mine was still in my pocket.

I checked. Fingers shook.
Still there.

Still warm.

Still playing.

üéµ Blackbird singing in the dead of night...

My brain hiccuped. The song playing in my earphones wasn‚Äôt the one glowing on hers. She had something else queued. Something I couldn‚Äôt hear.

But I could feel it.

Like teeth behind my spine.
Like memory unzipping in the dark.

I stood.

She raised her free hand.
Not waving. Not warning. Just holding her palm out, fingers splayed like a sigil.

Something clicked in my skull.

I‚Äôd seen her before.

Last fall.
On the edge of that blackout week.
Right before the woods.
Right before I‚Äî

No.
My brain wouldn‚Äôt finish the sentence.
It just‚Ä¶ stopped.
Like the thought hit a wall made of meat and bad dreams.

She stepped forward. Onto the water.

Not into.
Onto.

Each barefoot step rippled, but she didn‚Äôt sink.
She walked like the river was ice and she knew all its secrets.

I backed up.

Didn‚Äôt run. Not yet.

Because she looked sad.

And I wasn‚Äôt sure she was real.

And I wasn't sure I was, either.

Behind me, leaves rustled.
A twig snapped.

I turned fast.

Nothing.

But when I turned back to the river, she was gone.

No splash.
No sound.
No girl.

Just the faint echo of Let It Be‚Äîcoming from both pockets at once.

And the water, now swirling slightly. Clockwise.

Like something underneath had started to wake up.

I didn‚Äôt sleep that night.

But around 3:12 a.m., a knock came at my window.

It was Stella.

‚ÄúIsaac,‚Äù she whispered, ‚Äúwe need to talk. Something‚Äôs wrong with August.‚Äù

Chapter 5: Blackbird
Stella looked like she hadn‚Äôt slept in a week. Her hoodie was zipped up to her jaw, and her eyes darted like someone had swapped out her blood for coffee and fear.

She climbed in through the window without waiting for permission‚Äîclassic Stella‚Äîand pulled the curtain shut behind her like it might stop whatever was out there.

‚ÄúStart talking,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt find August,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúI mean‚Äîshe‚Äôs home. She‚Äôs in her room. But it‚Äôs not her.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything.

Because I‚Äôd seen something worse.

Because maybe August was still in there‚Ä¶ but maybe she brought something else back with her.

Stella held something out.

A notebook. Black cover. Torn at the edges.

‚ÄúShe left this in the woods,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThree days ago. Buried it under a cairn. I think it‚Äôs hers, but‚Ä¶‚Äù She stopped. Her throat clicked when she swallowed.

I opened it.

First page:
A drawing of the coin.
Then:
A girl standing on water.
Then:
A phrase written over and over again until the ink bled through the page‚Äî

You weren‚Äôt supposed to survive. You weren‚Äôt supposed to survive. You weren‚Äôt‚Äî

I closed the book.
The air felt thinner now. Like the room didn‚Äôt trust us.

‚ÄúLast fall,‚Äù I said.
Stella nodded. ‚ÄúThat week.‚Äù

We never talked about it.
What happened out there.
What didn‚Äôt.

The MP3 player buzzed in my pocket. Not played. Not skipped. Buzzed. Like a warning.

And then‚Äî

üéµ Blackbird singing in the dead of night‚Ä¶

Except this time, it wasn‚Äôt my headphones.
The sound was coming from outside.

We both turned toward the window.

Someone was standing in the yard.
Not moving.

Just standing there.
Backlit by the moon.

Stella grabbed my arm.
Tight.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs her,‚Äù she whispered.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs August.‚Äù

But August didn‚Äôt knock.

She just stood. Still. Silent.

And then she opened her mouth‚Äî

And started singing.

üéµ Take these broken wings and learn to fly‚Ä¶

But her mouth didn‚Äôt match the words.

She was lip-syncing. Out of time.
Like her body was just rehearsing being alive.

I stepped forward.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù Stella hissed. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not real right now.‚Äù

And still she sang.

Blackbird fly‚Ä¶ blackbird fly‚Ä¶ into the light of the dark black night‚Ä¶

Then she lifted one hand.

And held up‚Ä¶

The MP3 player.

The second one.

The one from the river.

It was playing.

But instead of the usual glow, this one bled light. Like the screen was cracked open to something else.

Something hungry.

She dropped it.

And vanished.

No sound.
No blur.

Just gone.

We stared at the spot.

Then at each other.

No words.

But we both knew:

She was calling us back.

To the woods.
To the river.
To whatever we left behind.

And it wanted all of us this time.

Not just Isaac.

Chapter 6: The Dead of Night
We didn‚Äôt plan to go.

Not at first.

But when the MP3 player started playing again‚Äîby itself, without batteries‚Äîwe stopped pretending we were safe.

We biked out just after midnight.

Same woods. Same path.
Only now, everything looked older.
Like time had peeled off the bark and left bones underneath.

Stella rode ahead, her headlight flickering like a dying eye.
Mine didn‚Äôt work at all. Figures. I was leading blind again.

But the river was ahead.
We both felt it.

Pulling.

We ditched the bikes near the old signpost.
Still broken.
Still pointing nowhere.

My fingers twitched.

This was the place.

The place it all started.

The place I‚Äî

Nope. Not thinking about it.

We moved quiet.
The way you do in dreams you‚Äôre afraid to wake up from.

There was something under the air. Like music, but not sound.
Like the memory of a violin strung with spiderwebs.

I looked at Stella.

She was shaking.
Not from fear.
From recognition.

She remembered too.

The cairn was still there.

Barely disturbed. A few rocks rolled down. A smear of something dark beneath.

The notebook had been returned.

But something new was on top.

A feather.

Pitch black.

Twisted. Burnt at the tip.

And beneath that?
A photo.

Of us.

From last fall.
Taken from behind. From the woods.
Watching us walk toward the river.

We never took that picture.

Stella made a sound, low in her throat. Like static caught in a mouth.

‚ÄúI think she‚Äôs trapped here,‚Äù she said.

I shook my head.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not trapped,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúShe belongs here. We‚Äôre the ones who weren‚Äôt supposed to make it out.‚Äù

Then the wind picked up.
Sharp and sudden. A gust from nowhere.
And something moved behind the trees.

A figure.

Small.
Barefoot.
White dress soaked to the knee.

Not August.

Not the girl from the river.

This one was new.

She stepped out. Slowly.
Like crawling out of a long nap in a shallow grave.

Her face was wrong.
Flickering between expressions, like she hadn‚Äôt decided who to be yet.

And her voice‚Äîwhen it came‚Äîwas low. Not a girl‚Äôs.

‚ÄúReturn what was borrowed.‚Äù

We froze.

‚ÄúOr lose what‚Äôs left.‚Äù

And then she opened her hand.

In her palm was the same coin from last fall.

The same one we thought we‚Äôd buried.

It spun in her fingers.

Faster.

Faster.

Then she closed her hand and‚Äî

Screamed.

Not sound. Not words. Just everything all at once. Pain. Rot. Memory. Fire.

We hit the dirt.

And the light came again.

White-hot.
Cracked open from the trees.

And then‚Äîblack.

When I woke up, Stella was gone.

And someone was whispering my name from inside the river.

But I'm also I've realized my parent and I despite still living with them, it feels more like I'm living with strangers, they know so little about me and I know so little about them, hell I don't even know how old they are

I think it's all around my mother, both of my parents are Vietnamese immigrants to Canada, I was born in Canada, my father has more embraced the Canadian life style, probably due to him fleeing Vietnam to Canada as a kid with his parents, however my mother on the other hand, was an orphan from birth adopted by a monk temple, now the thing is in Vietnam monks are considered very respected people and so my mother has a very strong ""I'm right or your wrong"" mentally, she never admits when she's done anything wrong

A list of the few things she's done but refuses to apologize for

-Years of hitting me with a yard stick as a child (punishment)
-on two occasions she told me to pray in Vietnamese (a language I am not fluent in btw) and when I messed up a few times, instead of understanding I don't understand Vietnamese and will struggle she threatened to hit me with the yard stick
-threw the 8000$ gaming PC tower (that my FATHERS WORK PAID FOR) out the second story window 
-broke multiple of my favorite toys as a kid
-forcing me do squats or stand on my knees till they became numb till she said to stop
-a few others things
-everytime she sees homeless people on the street and I'm with her she ALWAYS points and tells me that's gonna be me (she's probably right but still don't compare homeless people to me, their lives are shit enough without being compared to me)

The only thing I remember her ever apologizing for was when she bit my back until it bled, however despite saying she was sorry, she blamed me for it when the school saw the scar and called the police on her (btw if you're wondering what caused her to lash out and bite me, I overslept and was a few hours late for middleschool

Fun fact she only stopped hitting me with a yard stick because I called the police on her at a young age (she still holds all three police cases above my head as if I should be apologizing to her)

even today when I was clearly feeling mentally unwell and just wanted to listen to my music in the car but she's currently dragging me out to get my hair cut because she keeps bugging me about getting one (I gave up and caved in) also she noticed I was feeling mentally unwell and was trying to talk as little as possible, so obviously she starts rambling about how my father is clearly mentally unstable so of course I'd turned out mentally unstable as well (keep in mind this is the same women who threatens to take her own life whenever I disagree with her and argue for too long, honestly it's happened so many times I just walk away after she keeps screaming she's gonna do it, update she never has, not even a self harm cut (I don't wanna brag but I have a few on both my arms and have an OD attempt at 17, hehe amateur~ B3) 

Been trying to find a job but it's not exactly easy I'm 19M in Milton if anyone knows a good place hiring please

So till then I'm stuck in the house with my parents, I've only JUST NOW learning how to ride a bike from my woodshop teacher because my parents were always too busy to ever try and teach me to ride a bike so that'll be fun for this summer :D

Honestly though it's gotten to the point I just want an apology from my mother for all the stuff I've been though, although Loki must have been listening because he granted my wish (kinda) she has found a new way of humiliating me by being very condescending in her tone and bowing to me, same vibe as ""Oh PLeAsE oH LoRD"" 

I just want a genuine apology...or to leave

I'm currently in the car feeling as if I'm going to cry or have a panic attack, I don't want to be here I don't want a haircut, I don't want money, I don't want coffee, I don't want Boba I JUST WANT TO GO HOME

But home has never felt like home, I constantly feel like I'm stepping on egg shells, there's also a language barrier

I speak somewhat fluent English and not a lick of Vietnamese 

My mother Vietnamese and not a lick of English

My father speaks Vietnamese as a first, French as a second and English as a last, however his knowledge is very old

Another thing is my father is normally an ok father, can't fault him for working too much and oversleeping (it was to try and provide me with a financially stable house) he's said it on multiple occasions, ""I grew up with almost no opportunity and my family was poor, I want you to have as many opportunities as possible"" my best to translate one of things he's said that's stuck with me, sadly a downside of his is he is spineless and a hypocrite 

Whenever my mother pulls a hissy fit because I pissed her off, he ALWAYS takes my mother's side because he's worried for her and always tells me to just let it go and agree with my mother to just let her calm down

But whenever my father and mother get into a fight, GUESS WHO doesn't want to apologize to calm her down and GUESS WHO is in charge of transporting the messages between them like a wingless messenger Pidgeon DESPITE BOTH OF THEM HAVING PHONES, I've spent countless nights walking up and down stairs to carry a message to these two when they're in the middle of their stupid little bickering


(Update while writing I'm currently still in the car and my mother just had the gulls to say ""I don't think anybody likes being in the car you're driving"" meanwhile she is being a bitch and nagging at both of us)

Genuinely I think this summer might finally be it, my last straw, there might actually be a chance I finally just try again, pray maybe there is a god out there and pray they are merciful.

So anyways am I the asshole here?

On my wedding day, my fianc√© Elliot was killed instantly in a car accident.
From that moment on, I was a widow.
And the baby in my belly will never know what his father looks like.
I developed severe psychological issues from the trauma.
Countless times, I contemplated suicide. 
But every time, they all said the same thing‚Äî‚ÄúStay strong for my unborn baby.‚Äù 
Elliot's older brother and his wife came to his funeral. 
Staring at his face‚Äîidentical to my husband's in every feature‚ÄîI kept slipping into moments of disorientation. 
Then by chance, while passing his mother's bedroom, I overheard their conversation. 
""You faked your death to ditch your pregnant fianc√©e? All for that homewrecker? God, Elliot! She is carrying your CHILD!""

After sending the message, my fingers shook so badly I almost dropped the phone. Inside the room, their conversation kept going.

‚ÄúIs this fair to Briar?‚Äù Gladys‚Äôs voice trembled, laced with a rare hint of guilt. ‚ÄúIf it weren‚Äôt for the unborn baby, she might‚Äôve ended it all. Watching her so lost, barely eating and living‚Äîit‚Äôs heartbreaking.‚Äù

Elliot signed, as though the weight of his lies was finally pressing down.

‚ÄúBut Carmilla‚Äôs only got six months left,‚Äù he said, voice tight. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs her last wish, Mom. I can‚Äôt just walk away.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd Briar?‚Äù Gladys pushed. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs carrying your child.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll make it up to her in the future.‚Äù he said. ‚Äú Don‚Äôt worry,mom.‚Äù

My heart felt like it was being crushed, the pain instantly radiating through my entire body until I could barely breathe.

I stumbled back to my bedroom, knees buckling beneath me as I crumpled onto the floor. 

My phone vibrated. Conor.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on, Briar? Is everything okay? Elliot‚Äôs‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs dead, right?‚Äù

I opened my mouth to speak, but the words wouldn‚Äôt come. Instead, tears poured down, hot and blinding. The world knew Elliot Sterling was dead.

But I knew better.

I understood Conor's confusion. Even I couldn't have imagined Elliot would fake his death, let alone that he'd do it for another bit//ch.

Though I said nothing, my brother seemed to sense my emotional state. After a long pause, he spoke softly.

""The day after tomorrow evening. I'll send a plane to pick you up then.I‚Äôll take care of everything else.""

After hanging up, I remained frozen in position, still holding the phone.

Just then, a gentle knock came at the door. Standing outside was Elliot's ""older brother""

Or rather, Elliot Sterling himself‚Äîholding a glass of warm milk.

""Hey, Briar, what‚Äôs going on? Why are you sitting on the floor like that? Have you been crying? You... you must be missing Elliot, huh?""

During the weeks since Elliot had returned as his supposed brother, he'd been incredibly kind to me, seemingly treating me as his deceased brother's widow.

Countless times when facing his concern, I'd felt lost my mind.Gladys always attributed this o grief over losing Elliot.

I discreetly locked my phone screen and forced a smile.

""It's nothing.The baby kicked me and I lost my balance for a moment.""

Elliot visibly relaxed, setting down the milk before carefully helping me up from the floor.

""That little troublemaker.Wait until he's born‚Äîhis uncle will teach him.""

""Come on.Here some milk for you. Drink it and take a break. Elliot wouldn't hope for this situation.""

Hearing him mention his own name, I finally couldn't hold back anymore. I looked directly into his eyes and deliberately asked

""Tell me the truth. Are you Elliot Sterling""

Elliot froze for a moment, then laughed softly as he gently brushed my hair.

‚ÄúBriar, you‚Äôre exhausted,‚Äù he said, his tone dripping with fake concern. ‚ÄúWhy would you think I‚Äôm Elliot? That‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù

""Tomorrow‚Äôs your prenatal checkup. I‚Äôll take you. You need rest.That's my brother's only bloodline in the world. I'm going to make sure that baby arrives safely.""

I lowered my eyes, unable to stomach the fake concern in his gaze.

""Just go. I‚Äôm exhausted.""

Only after the door clicked shut did the tears I'd been holding back all evening finally come flooding out.

Elliot and I met at a college party.He fell for me at the freshman party.and pursued me.

Two years after graduation, he gave me the most extravagant proposal.

I still remember that night‚Äîthe fireworks reflected in his eyes,but his eyes even more brighter than the fireworks.

While planning our wedding, I discovered I was pregnant. Elliot had been overjoyed.

‚ÄúPerfect timing,‚Äù he whispered, pressing his forehead to mine. ‚ÄúOur baby came for celebrating our wedding. Briar, dear,I'm the happiest man alive right now.‚Äù

I still can't wrap my head around it. Six years together, and he throws it all away,faking his own death just to bail on our wedding.

Early the next morning, Elliot knocked on my door.

‚ÄúBriar?Time for your prenatal checkup. You ready?‚Äù

But just as we were about to leave, Carmilla's voice called from behind us.

‚ÄúElliot, baby, I‚Äôm not feeling well.Could you stay with me today?‚Äù

At the sound of her voice, Elliot didn't even glance my way before rushing to her side.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong, sweetheart? You should be resting.‚Äù

Then he turned to me with a quick glance.

‚ÄúSorry, Briar,my wife‚Äôs not feeling well. James will drive you to the hospital.‚Äù

‚ÄúJames is outside, he‚Äôll take you. I already called to Dr. Wilson. He's waitting for you. Just go straight over there.‚Äù

I closed my eyes, trying to hold back the tears threatening to spill.

When I opened them again, I didn't miss the fleeting look of satisfaction on Carmilla's face.

Without a word, I nodded and walked out, closing the door behind me with a dull thud.My hand unconsciously stroked my belly as heavy tears finally fell.

James got me to the hospital on time, and I completed all the scheduled tests.

Elliot had previously instructed both the driver and doctor‚Äîif I didn't show up, he would become suspicious.

I sat in the hospital waiting area, staring at the blurry ultrasound picture. Just a tiny blob on the grainy black-and-white image.

The doctor had pointed at it, smiling ""See that? That's your little one.""

But I couldn't bear my kid has a father who kept a side piece!

I wiped my face with my sleeve and made a quick call to schedule an appointment at another hospital.

This was the Sterling family's private hospital‚Äîif I had the procedure here, Elliot would definitely find out.

I texted James: 'Just going to grab some coffee and take a walk. You can go ahead and leave.'

Waiting until his black sedan pulled away,I hurried to the curb and went to another hospital.

My phone buzzed just as I was signing the consent form for the abo//rtion. A video message from an unknown number.

The video was thirty minutes. In this video, Elliot did no-holds-barred make love which I'd never seen Elliot out of control like this.

For six years, he had been Mr. Considerate in bed, and he worried that I would get hurt if he was too rough.

Turns out he wasn't naturally restrained in bed. Who can meet his appetite is someone else.

I forced myself watch the video, torturing myself with every second of seeing a side of Elliot I never knew.

I don't know how long I sat there before a nurse approached me.

""Ms. Briar? Are you alright? It's time for your procedure.""

I couldn't stop crying as I watched the video, even my hand holding the phone couldn't stop shaking.

The worst part? I still loved that asshole. Even after everything.

I couldn't just delete him like a bad Instagram post.Six years. Six years. Loving Elliot was like breathing‚Äîit just came naturally, even now.

Everyone always said Elliot was obsessed with me, but they never saw how I'd saved every movie ticket stub from our dates or how I'd memorized his coffee order by our third date.

Six years together....and only now.

Remembering the rapid little heartbeat I'd heard during the check, I wiped away my tears and took a deep breath.Give the last chance for my baby and Elliot.

Then I called him.

""Elliot, can you come to the hospital? I‚Ä¶ we need to talk.""

His voice came through weirdly breathless. ""I'm kind of in the middle of something. Just Uber home and we'll talk there, okay?""

""Oh god, Elliot, harder‚Ä¶"",with a soft moan the call disconnected, leaving just the dial tone.

I'm not a kid, I knew exactly what he was doing.

I looked up at the nurse hovering nearby.

""Well,let‚Äôs do it.""

It was after dark when I got home. The second I stepped through the door,Elliot came striding toward me.

""James said you went around. What'd you buy?""

Then he clocked my puffy eyes.

""What‚Äôs wrong? Briar.Did you cry?what happened? About Elliot?Oh,The baby you're carrying belongs to Elliot,at least a comfort ""

""What was this thing you wanted to talk about me?""

I stared at his face‚Äîthat perfect jawline, those eyes that still made my crazy.

The same eyes I'd just watched in vedio from Carmilla.

""Never mind,‚Äù I said, forcing a weak smile. ‚ÄúJust checking if you needed anything.""

He practically deflated with relief.

""You should get some rest,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúYou look‚Ä¶ rough.""

I just nodded and bolted for my bedroom.

I fell asleep almost instantly, my dreams taking me back to college‚Äîfreshman Elliot with his floppy hair and that vintage Nirvana t-shirt.

""Briar Collins, I've had a crush on you since day one. Will you date with me?""

""Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll treat you right.""

Maybe it was the golden sunset making everything magical, or maybe it was the sincerity in his eyes that I couldn't resist.

Somehow, I ended up saying yes.  

I woke up to sunlight streaming through the blinds. First decent night's sleep I'd had since learning of his ""death.""

I was still sitting dazed in bed when my door was opened and Carmilla came in.

""Wanna know why I sent that video? Still think Elliot‚Äôs some doting brother and I‚Äôm just your sister-in-law?""

I didn't bother answering her. Just sat there,laughing at myself.

""So stupid!""

When I first got the news about Elliot's crash, I completely lost it‚Äîpassed out cold on the kitchen floor.

Gladys told me they'd already cremated him.They didn't let me attend the service‚Äîsupposedly protecting me from additional trauma.

Every detail was marking that something about Elliot's death didn't nomal.

For six years, everyone thought we were perfect couple. I never thought in a million years that he would ditch our wedding with some soap opera gimmick!ÔºÅ

Then this mysterious ""brother"" appears from New Zealand with his exotic wife in tow.

Even though I felt confused sometime, I never once suspected Elliot had faked his death.

Not until I overheard that conversation between him and Gladys did I realize what a massive lie they'd constructed around me!

Carmilla's lips curled into a smirk when I didn't snap back.

""Women know women, Briar.Yesterday, when you walked out? I knew you‚Äôd figured it out.""

""Dying to know why he cheated? Why Mr. Perfect escaped you and your baby?"" She laughed. ""Should I tell you what he says about you when you're not around?""

""Says you're a total snooze fest in bed. With me?"" She ran her hands down her body. ""I keep him begging for more. His exact words? 'I do it better...""

I slapped her hard across the face.

She was mid-rage when Elliot appeared in the doorway.

""What the FU//CK, Briar?!""

Like flipping a switch, Carmilla's face morphed from smug to wounded cat.

""I was just visit her,"" she whimpered. ""I know she's going through a hard time with Elliot's death and all, but‚Äî""

Elliot's eyes locked on the red mark forming on Carmilla's cheek before he shouted me.

"" Briar, she is your SISTER-IN-LOW!""

I met his eyes directly.

""Tell me, Elliot.Is she your wife or not?!""

For a moment, he just stared at me, lips parted but silent. 

Carmilla grabbed his arm then.

""Elliot, honey,I‚Äôm feeling dizzy. Will you take me to bed?""

Elliot hesitated before guiding her out.

I stayed frozen in place, staring at the empty doorway, hands still shaking.Then my phone vibrated,a text from Conor.

""Wheels up in 30. Be ready.""

I pulled out the suicide note I'd written and tucked it into my nightstand.Let Elliot find it after I was gone. Let him read every single word.

I wanted him to read exactly how much I worshipped him‚Äîenough to ""suicide"" over losing him.

I wanted that guilt to kill him until he was nothing but a hollow shell.

I shoved my ID and credit card into my pocket, yanking the door open.Elliot was right there, almost crashing into me.

His brows knitted together as he opened his mouth.""I'm sorry,Briar, about earlier‚Äî""

I cut him off. ""I'm going for a walk.Take good care of my sister-in-low,brother Christian.""

I deliberately emphasized the words ""brother"" and ""sister-in-low"".

But clueless Elliot just looked relieved.

""Yeah, take your time. Dinner's at seven. Rosa‚Äôs making that truffle pasta you love.""

I nodded, but as I brushed past him, I shot him one last ice-cold look.

Payback's a bit//ch, Elliot Sterling. You want to play dead? Game on.

1krfilu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghosting/comments/1krfilu/i_flew_across_the_world_for_someone_who_ghosted/,I flew across the world for someone who ghosted me. Still trying to make peace with it,"A few years ago, I met a woman on Bumble who was visiting my city from Europe. I was new to the city myself ‚Äî had only been there 9 months and didn‚Äôt know many people. We met for coffee and really hit it off. She invited me to visit her country sometime, and a few months later, I booked a trip.

I was only there for a week, but we met up twice. We kissed, made out, and seemed to have genuine chemistry. On our last date, she had to leave for her dad‚Äôs birthday. Before I flew home, she texted, ‚ÄúYou must be flying out ‚Äî see you soon xx.‚Äù It felt hopeful.

We kept in touch. About a month later, I told her the dates I was planning to come back. She said she wasn‚Äôt sure what her schedule would look like and that it might be busy, but added, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see how it goes.‚Äù We kept talking casually after that.

When I arrived for the second trip, she acted surprised, saying she didn‚Äôt realize I had actually booked those dates. That really hurt ‚Äî I had clearly communicated them. She said she‚Äôd let me know when she was free, but she never followed up. I stayed there for a month. She watched my Instagram stories the entire time but never reached out.

I didn‚Äôt talk to her for 9 months.

Eventually, I visited that country again to see friends. I thought about what happened and decided to call her to clear the air. She didn‚Äôt answer. A week later, I flew home and called again ‚Äî no answer ‚Äî so I left a voicemail saying I hoped she was well.

She left a voice message back the next day asking how I was and its been a while. She apologized for being ‚ÄúMIA‚Äù and said she wasn‚Äôt talking to anyone and work was busy. That message felt hollow. It was like all my effort didn‚Äôt matter. I replied bluntly and said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs bullshit. You didn‚Äôt reply because you didn‚Äôt want to.‚Äù We got into a heated exchange, and she blocked me on WhatsApp.

Later, I reached out on Instagram and apologized. I explained why I was hurt ‚Äî that I had flown across the world because we talked about it. She said she appreciated the apology, but blamed me for not making plans and said that‚Äôs why she never followed up. I felt blamed again. She told me, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt owe you anything,‚Äù and claimed I never told her I was coming to see her either time.

I offered to speak on the phone, but she said she was now seeing someone and that wouldn‚Äôt be appropriate ‚Äî unlike ghosting me in a foreign country, I guess. She eventually ghosted again and blocked me on Instagram.

That was the last time I heard from her.

It‚Äôs been almost a year, and I‚Äôm still carrying it. I reached out a couple more times by SMS (which I regret), trying to fix things, but it never works that way. I‚Äôve come to accept that people will do what they want, and closure isn‚Äôt always given. I just wish she had told me she wasn‚Äôt interested. Instead, my time, energy, and feelings were disregarded. And yeah ‚Äî it left me cynical and bitter

Edit:

TL;DR:
Met a woman on Bumble while she was visiting my city from Europe. We hit it off and she invited me to visit her. I flew over twice ‚Äî she ghosted me the second time. The second time, I stayed for a month and never heard back despite clearly communicating my plans. After months of silence, I reached out to clear the air ‚Äî we argued, she blocked me. I apologized later, she blamed me, then blocked me again. It‚Äôs been almost a year, and I still feel hurt.

I was lucky enough to visit Casa del Perfume Canario's Tenerife store. They have a few stores across the Canary Islands, and their perfumes are inspired by the Islands' vibes, stories and ingredients.

The store assistant was lovely and let me sniff all of the fruity, floral and gourmand scents with coffee bean breaks in between. I was a little overwhelmed so I ended up going with the first one she showed me. A perfume that captures the essence of Tenerife as a holiday destination: a fruity, fruity, fruity perfume. 

Nisa's top, heart and base notes are all fruit. A 'pi√±a colada with a melon wedge' would be a good way to describe it! Top notes of two different kinds of melon, heart notes of apples, oranges and guavas and base notes of coconut and pineapple make it smell delicious at first spray. It's fresh and fruity without hitting 'sugary fruit juice'. When it settles onto my skin it pulls strongly of coconut melon. The calone is strong in this one. 

As expected, it isn't very strong and needs more sprays than usual for any sort of projection. I'm an 'I want to smell myself, and for others to smell me when they hug me' sort of person, and I needed multiple sprays the arms and neck. Longevity is only a couple of hours. But I smell delicious.

I may have gone for a different scent if I was left to my own devices instead of needing to be in and out and choose in a couple of minutes. But I'm still glad I chose this one. Definitely unique in my collection! ",2,1747773284.0,FemFragLab30plus,1,1.0,False
1krffsh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1krffsh/i_was_having_so_much_pain_last_thursday_i_had_to/,I was having so much pain last Thursday I had to go to the ER. I am wondering if it has something to do with my new prescription I am on.,"Last Thursday I got up and got my coffee like normal. Not too long after that I started getting this sharp pain in the middle of my chest. I had just taken my meds so I thought maybe a pill didn't go down all the way. I got something to eat but didn't help.

A few hours later I felt the pain in my back between my shoulder blades. I was like I had a sword stabbed through me. When I bent over or layed back it felt worse. It started going into my jaw area and I was getting a headache. Then it got into my shoulder area. This was over about 10-12 hours. I decided to go to the ER because I thought I was having a heart attack.

The pain I was in they gave me those pills that melt under your tongue. It took two of them to make it manageable. They did X-ray and MRI. They also did blood tests. I found out today that my aorta is inflamed a little. The pain went away for about 3 days but came back last night and it's here now. It is not as bad as it was. My question is has anyone had any heart problems because of the medication they were on?

My neurologist just put me on Onfi (Clobazam) about 2 months ago. It's the third pill I am on now. I have seen it can cause breathing problems, which I was having. I really don't know if I should say something to my neurologist or not. 

I mean I was in pain like a 9 out of 10. I don't want that to happen again. I got appointments set up with the cardiologist next week. I have that stress test. That's going to be fun. ",1,1747773246.0,Epilepsy,0,1.0,False
1krffq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/1krffq9/looking_for_locals_opinions_on_lake_geneva_dining/,Looking for locals' opinions on Lake Geneva dining and beaches,"A group of us (\~27F, one under 21, from Chicagoland) are visiting Lake Geneva this weekend for my friend's bachelorette trip. We'll be there Friday afternoon through Sunday afternoon and we'll be staying at an Airbnb north of Lake Como. I've done my research and have a good sense of our food/beverage/entertainment options. Looking for locals' input to finalize our itinerary, especially if there are things to know about wait times, reservations, and parking for large groups. 

**Best restaurant for Friday night takeout?** Considering Sabai Sabai, Next Door Pub (their lakeside location), and Papa's Blue Spruce Resort (maybe also Los Tres Hermanos or Oakfire, though the latter seems better for dining in). 

**Best coffee?** We'll be making our own breakfast at the Airbnb, but I imagine we'll also make a morning coffee run. Ideally we'll try two different places on Saturday and Sunday. Considering Inspired, The Porch, Boxed and Burlap, Niche, and House of Music Caf√© (Coffee Mill also looks great but is a 20 min drive). 

**Best light lunch in or near Downtown Lake Geneva?** Considering Simple Caf√© and Joni's Diner (maybe also Popeye's). Looking for healthy-ish wraps, sandwiches, salads. 

**Best dinner after a wine tasting at Studio Winery?** I see that Next Door Pub  is close by, but considering also PIER 290, Barrique Bistro, and Flat Iron. Sopra also looks great but unsure about $$$. Oakfire and Sabai Sabai could also be put back on the table if not chosen on Friday. My friend likes Italian so Cafe Calamari is also on my radar (Tuscan Tavern doesn't seem like the right vibe, and Sweet Aroma is a bit far away).

**Best ice cream / dessert?** Here's what I've gathered, please feel free to correct me: Gelato from Medusa Kitchen seems like a must. I know Scoops is popular because they serve Chocolate Shoppe ice cream, but there's also places in Chicago that sell it so maybe not a stop on this trip, although it is in a convenient location. For non-ice cream in the Downtown area, O2 looks great for bubble tea. Something Sweet has favorable ratings but I can't really tell what's distinctive about it? Outside of Lake Geneva, which would you choose between Blue Heaven, Dip in the Bay, Meggy Moo's, and The Frosty Moose? I wish I had five stomachs. Last I'll mention are the tiramisu, cannolis, and cakes from Riga-Tony's, and, if I happen upon them at a coffee shop, baked goods from Pastries by Chad.

**Best beach?** I've seen Fontana Beach recommended over the Riviera Beach, although the parking is more expensive. Thoughts? We were planning to go on Sunday, weather-permitting, and I was thinking we could get grab & go sandwiches from either Green Grocer or The Cheese Shop, or get lunch at Chuck's Lakeshore Inn if Fontana is indeed the move. If it's too cold I'm thinking either a walk along the Lake Shore Path (starting at the library), booking a Drive-Through Safari, or hanging out at either Chuck's Lakeshore Inn, Mars Resort, or Magpie's OR, for a bougier vibe, Barrique Bistro, PIER 290, The Bottle Shop, or Niche Cafe and Wine Bar? Whichever we haven't already visited, basically. 

If you've made it this far, thanks for enduring the Type A-ness of it all. I appreciate any suggestions/help in narrowing down these options. Lake Geneva, Como, Williams Bay, Fontana, and perhaps even Delavan are fair game for additional recommendations. 

  
P.S. Just to mention, we won't be doing much night life, so unfortunately I don't think we'll be going to The Apothecary or speakeasy at Maxwell Mansion or any breweries like Topsy Turvy, etc. As for shopping, I think we'll pop into The Candle Mercantile and the Market of Lake Geneva.

Everyone hates gas taxes. Everyone hates anything that increases their cost of transportation, which is understandable: it is a tax on their household budget. It is money out of their pocket. I hate it too. And furthermore, everyone resents where the government spends the money it collects. Whether it grinds your gears when the government spends money on a billionaire's new sports stadium, or when it spends money on inflated public employee pensions, nobody likes paying more money to the government. I hate it all, too. And when it pertains to roads, people think, ""why am I paying for it? Shouldn't the truckers be paying for it? Don't my property taxes pay for them? Don't gas taxes pay for it? Don't vehicle registration fees pay for it? Shouldn't billionaire's be paying for it since they benefit the most from economic infrastructure? Why the hell is this falling on me, just trying to commute to work or drive my child to school?!""

**Unfortunately, it does fall on you and me to pay congestion charges, because we drivers are the only ones that can decide if and when we drive. We decide when we find an alternative method of transportation. We decide where we buy houses and live, and thusly what our commutes will be. There is no alternative to you and me paying the congestion charge, because it is you and me creating the congestion, and the** ***only thing*** **that can eliminate congestion is an incentive system to discourage us from driving during peak periods.**

# What is road congestion?

Road congestion is slow travel speeds and traffic jams. It occurs when demand for road capacity exceeds the carrying capacity of the road. The crucial point to understand is that it results in *lower road throughput* compared to a free-flowing road. As in, many people innocently assume, ""yes I'm only moving 20mph or 30mph on a 60mph highway, but there are many thousands of cars on the road here with me all making slow progress, cumulatively in terms of collective vehicle-miles traveled, we must be doing ok"". But that is not the case, cumulative vehicle-miles per hour actually *goes down* when a road is experiencing congestion. [This graph explains the situation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Speed-flow_horseshoe_diagram_traffic_congestion.svg). After demand for road capacity reaches a critical saturation point, the whole system jams up and fewer vehicle-miles per hour get traveled. More people would have been able to get to their destination on-time had access to the road been regulated, rather than allowing everyone to plop on to the road with no planning.

Road congestion costs Americans hundreds of billions of dollars in cash, lost time, and lost productivity each year. And when you're considering all the time that you personally lose each week to congestion, it's important not to under-count: its not just the actual extra time you sit in traffic, it is the amount beyond that where you left even earlier because the amount of congestion was unpredictable before you left. For example, you can drive to the airport in 30 minutes door to door when the roads are congestion-free. You are planning a trip to the airport where the trip is going to take at least 45 minutes with expected congestion... but possibly up to 1h15m in really bad traffic, so you have to leave that early to guaranty that you will be at the airport on time. You will probably be early and end up sitting at your gate for an extra 15-30 minutes, but it was unavoidable. Its additional lost time at work or with your family. There's all the money that literally goes up in smoke as cars sit idling on the highway, wasting fuel keeping their engines running while they're hardly moving. The extra wear and tear on tires and brakes. The extra chance of collisions as people are all jockeying for position within the traffic jam and making quick movements. There's the spillover from highways onto local streets, bringing in people who cutting through residential neighborhoods, and then residents demand speed bumps and other ""traffic calming infrastructure"", which cost millions of dollars and are a useless annoyance during the times there isn't a traffic jam on the highway and people aren't cutting through the neighborhood.

# Can't we just build more roads and lanes?

In short, no. Roads are extremely expensive and take up massive amounts of land, but even if we committed to spending **unlimited** money and land to increase the *supply* of road capacity, we still could not eliminate congestion without addressing the *demand* side of the equation. The issue is that it only costs so much to drive a car, in terms of gasoline and wear & tear. Many people can afford that cost to drive their car even for marginal low-productivity trips. Many people wouldn't think twice about just ""going for a drive"". So in the end, it is often only congestion itself that dissuades people from taking a trip. For example, I want to drive to the starbucks with the drive-through so I don't even have to park and get out of my car, and when there's no congestion its only a 5 minute drive, so I go, but right now with traffic it would be 15 minutes in each direction, so I begrudgingly make my own coffee at home. You can spend billions to build more lanes, and more roads, and eliminate bottlenecks, but without a road pricing strategy people will just immediately consume that capacity taking low-productivity trips (see *induced demand*) that they easily could have consolidated or avoided.

And realistically we obviously wouldn't be spending ""unlimited"" money, there is always a practical limit, and usually our planners aren't willing to design to eliminate rush hour congestion. During prime commuting hours, there is just too much road demand, if you built enough road capacity for that big spike in demand, then you would have drastically too much roadway for all the other hours of the week. So in practical terms, without addressing the demand side of the equation, we can never eliminate rush hour congestion.

# How would it work?

I am open to different implementations, I just want to eliminate congestion. There are varying approaches that could have varying levels of granularity in tracking and preventing congestion, with different pros and cons. The commonality is that they all involve continuously setting and re-setting a dynamic congestion charge that is set at the level high enough to prevent congestion, and no higher. In the middle of the night, there would typically be zero charge, because there is no congestion even without a charge. During situations that would ordinarily create apocalypse-level congestion, such as people traveling to a major concert or sporting event, during rush hour, leading up to a long weekend when people are heading out of town, while there also happens to be a severe rain or snowstorm, the charge in that scenario admittedly could get so high that people will be tweeting and writing news articles about it. It is the price it needs to be to eliminate congestion, regardless of how high that might be. One source of inspiration for how it could work is how my state implements real-time electricity pricing, like for people who have solar panels and want to sell electricity up to the grid. With real time electricity pricing, the grid operator is constantly updating projections about what electricity will cost in each hour of the upcoming days, and during each day the operator is even updating projections about what electricity will cost for each hour of that very day, incorporating all the latest data they have to make the most accurate possible projections in the moments before people are going to be using the electricity. Similarly, the roads authority could make projections about what the congestion charge will have to be, for each stretch of road, for each 15 minute increment of the day. They would make these projections available via free API, so all the maps apps like Google and Apple will have access to these road price projections, and will automatically include the projections for the congestion charge each time you pull up directions. Cars could be tracked by GPS, plate-reading cameras, or RFID tags and readers. You account is associated with your car and your account is automatically billed.

# Won't this be a burden for working class families?

No! This is a huge windfall profit for *everyone*!

First of all, let's say that we're implementing this congestion charge in a totally revenue-neutral manner. Every dollar collected through the congestion charge is a dollar worth of taxes that can be lowered elsewhere. Lower property taxes, lower sales taxes, or whatever else. So we're not even talking about increasing taxes in net. We're talking about increasing taxes on people who consume road capacity during peak hours, and *decreasing* taxes on everyone else. We could even distribute a ""congestion tax Citizen's Dividend"", we could take part of the collected congestion charges and distribute them out evenly as cash to all the local residents, so each area resident would get a few hundred bucks cash each year as a payout from the congestion charge, and they could spend that however they want.

Second of all, working class people will benefit from faster and more efficient roads like everyone else will. They will also benefit from never having to sit in traffic. And sometimes these working class people are driving their own car, but congestion free roads are also a massive boon to public bus services. Suddenly, bus schedules can be reliably maintained, and the bus becomes an attractive and efficient way to get around. You could have rush hour commuter bus services that are not only cheaper than driving to work, but also faster than driving to work in the old congestion that we've eliminated. People would carpool to split the charge, with coworkers or *ad hoc* via apps and designation pickup points (""slugging""). Working class people will be able to go where they need to go, faster, and sometimes for even less money than before.",0,1747772775.0,changemyview,37,0.33,False

Not even to my therapist. But I‚Äôm writing it down now because last night‚Äîat 2:12 a.m.‚ÄîI heard the knock again. Same rhythm. Same pause. The same sick feeling crawling up the back of my throat.

I used to think it was a demon.

I know how that sounds. But when you‚Äôre a kid, there are things you just know without proof. You don‚Äôt question why your closet makes you nauseous or why the attic door feels like it‚Äôs breathing. You just know something‚Äôs wrong.

And something was very wrong in that house.

We moved in when I was nine. Old Victorian at the edge of a dead-end street. Sloped floors. Wallpaper like dried blood. My mom called it a ‚Äúfresh start.‚Äù She‚Äôd just gotten serious with a new boyfriend‚ÄîRick. He helped pay for the place but stayed in the city at first. So for a while, it was just me and her.

The first night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. Normal new-house stuff, I thought. Until I heard it:

Knock.

Just one. Soft. Like someone gently tapped their knuckle against my door.

I sat up in bed, listening hard.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

Three more. Spaced out. Deliberate.

Then‚Äîsilence.

I got up and opened the door. The hallway was empty.

I asked my mom in the morning if she‚Äôd checked on me. She said no. She looked‚Ä¶ tired. Her hands were shaking when she poured her coffee. I noticed a red mark on her neck. She said it was a bug bite.

That night, I stacked books against the door. Just in case.

The knocking came again. Same time‚Äîaround 2 a.m.

But this time, it didn‚Äôt stop.

It turned into scraping. Like nails dragging across the door. Then breathing‚Äîwet and slow, right up against the wood. I heard it say something I didn‚Äôt understand. Too low, too garbled.

And then I smelled it‚Äîrot, like something dead had been stuffed under the floorboards.

I didn‚Äôt sleep. Just stared at the door, flashlight clutched tight.

In the morning, my mom had a bruise on her arm. Purple and angry, like someone had grabbed her too hard. She said she tripped on the stairs. She wouldn‚Äôt meet my eyes when she said it.

It kept happening.

Some nights, it tried the doorknob. Other nights, I‚Äôd hear it crawl across the hall. And once, I heard crying‚Äîsoft, broken sobs, like someone trying not to be heard.

Sometimes it came for me. Sometimes it didn‚Äôt. But someone always got hurt.

The worst was when I forgot to block the door.

I was half-asleep when I heard the slow creak of it opening.

I froze. Pulled the covers over my head.

Something stepped into the room.

It didn‚Äôt walk right‚Äîtoo heavy, too slow. The mattress dipped beside me.

And it breathed.

Right in my face. Hot, sour, and wrong.

Then, finally, it left.

In the morning, I had scratches across my back. Through my shirt.

I didn‚Äôt tell my mom. She already looked like she was unraveling.

Eventually, Rick moved in. Just showed up one day with his bags and that look like he belonged there all along.

The weird part? The knocking stopped.

But the house didn‚Äôt feel safer. It felt worse.

Colder. Heavier.

And my mom seemed even more withdrawn.

I started having dreams. Of something watching me from the hallway. Tall and thin with no face, just a mouth full of too many teeth.

Sometimes I woke up with bruises. Sometimes with dirt under my nails.

Once, I woke up outside. Lying on the porch. Barefoot.

My hands were bleeding.

I told my mom we had to leave.

She cried. Said she‚Äôd find a way.

That night, she locked her bedroom door.

And I waited.

2:09 a.m.

Footsteps.

They didn‚Äôt stop outside my door this time. They kept going. Toward hers.

I heard her murmur something‚Äîconfused, half-asleep.

‚ÄúRick‚Ä¶?‚Äù

Then a crash. And a scream. Then silence.

I ran to her room.

The door was open just enough.

Inside, in the dark, something was crouched over her. Tall. Wrong. It held her down, hands wrapped around her wrists. She was fighting, kicking, sobbing.

And then it turned to me.

And grinned.

I didn‚Äôt think.

I ran to the kitchen. Grabbed the biggest knife I could find.

When I came back, it was still on top of her.

I screamed, ran forward, and drove the blade into its back.

Again.

And again.

And again.

Until it slumped to the floor.

My mom was screaming.

Screaming at me.

I looked down.

It wasn‚Äôt a monster.

No claws.

No fangs.

Just a man.

Just Rick.

His face was caved in. One eye open. One shut. Lips split like someone had tried to tear the truth out of them.

The police came. Said it was self-defense. Said I saved her.

But she never looked at me again.

We moved out of the house.

She never spoke to me after that.

Years later, I still don‚Äôt sleep with the door open.

I live alone now. One-bedroom apartment. Third floor. No creaks, no attic, no shadows in the hallway.

Still‚Ä¶

Last night, I woke up at 2:12 a.m.

Knock.

Knock. Knock.

Tap.

And a voice behind the door.

Not growling. Not whispering.

Just‚Ä¶ tired.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

Edit:
This morning I found something under my bed.

My old flashlight. Cracked. The one I used to keep under my pillow.

Still faintly glowing.

I wouldn't take her edits or description of things at face value.","I'm never rooting for Acacia to fail. I'm never hoping she chooses to be a controversial/irresponsible influencer every day. If anything I hope everyone including Acacia magically wakes up each day and decides to be a good, honest person in every facet. That's just not the case in reality usually. Change needs to be genuine, not contrived via manipulation and edits. 

We have already noticed a few misrepresentations thus far in the vlogs. 

The first is that ""no one will hire me."" When she was literally handed a job at a coffee shop and just didn't take it. 

Also that she's ""doing it alone."" At times the way Acacia manipulates reminds me of how Casey Anthony described her own lies, where ""there was always a nugget of truth."" Yes Acacia is the parent the kids live with. But we also know that someone does help her with child care. From what we've heard, most likely the grandparents. Kylie/Lola even recently posted a tiktok of the two of them in the car singing at night with no kids. That would not be possible unless someone was watching the kids. 

Just consider that in her last vlog, that was the same week that Acacia had both an arraignment and Luci got lost. No mention of it. Which, fair, keep whatever details of your life private that you want. I'm just saying her ultimate goal with these vlogs is to give herself a flattering edit. It's not the end all be all of who she is and the situation. So if you walk away from the vlog thinking ""what a kind, quaint, sweet person"" or even ""poor her she's such a victim and hard working mom"" that's because every editing choice she makes is made with the intention to make you feel exactly that.
