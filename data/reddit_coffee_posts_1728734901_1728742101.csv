We will be leaving from Minneapolis in the morning and want to be home by five or six. What should we do along the way? Suggestions for scenic overlooks, coffee shops, bakeries, lunch spots. If you know of a place to get a really great apple pie, let me know!

Should we stop in Red Wing?

1g20ubo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1g20ubo/aita_for_cutting_my_narcissisticenabling_in_laws/,AITA for cutting my narcissistic/enabling in laws off? ," For background, my husband and I have been together for about 4 years and married back in January 2021. We have two kids, one from a previous relationship and a 2 year old daughter. 
He used to work with my brother and my dad so he has known my family for years prior to be being in the picture. I also met his parents before him since I worked with his dad in close quarters. In fact, his dad and I were very close and very good friends.
I befriended his mom thru his dad and we also started a close friendship. At first they seemed great and fun  and when my husband and I got together it seemed like the perfect relationship (with his parents) I mean we were friends! 
Pretty early on hubby made comments about his mom like “she’s only cool if you’re not her son” or “you think she’s like that but you’ll see” 
I remember even standing up for her once or twice cuz my husband said something mean to her. 
Anyway pretty soon into my relationship with their son, I started to notice what he meant. And once you see it, you cannot unsee it. 
These are things she did to name a few. And trust me, there are way more. 
She got angry at me for Halloween cuz my son had a fever and couldn’t go trick or treating. She send me a pretty nasty text about how I don’t care about her and I hate her. 

She got nasty for thanksgiving cuz my parents invited us over (it was the first family event we got invited to as a couple) she said “I guess me and dad will just be here alone then” so I invited her too since my mom said it was fine. 

She got nasty for Christmas because we split the night up to see both families since we both celebrated on the 24th. I missed the majority of my family’s Christmas because we were at my husband’s family celebration and when we decided to leave 3 hrs after we were supposed to, she said I was “taking her son away and I didn’t let her see him”.

Mother’s Days were always about her because you know I have two kids but I’m not a mom?? One year she made us picnic under the rain literally and my son had a cold and just like Halloween she didn’t care. 

Her husband planned a nice trip to NYC (we lived in Jersey) to an art gallery and it was great but not for her! Oh no she made sure we knew she was disappointed. 

One time we were eating take out at my house and out of nowhere she just says “I wanna leave” so my father in law just closes his container and gets up and they leave. I say there, with the fork still in my hand shocked. We were all still eating lol it all happened in like less than 5 minutes. Just what? 

If I didn’t go over, I would get the you hate me texts, but if I did go over I had to watch everything that came out of my mouth because god forbid she got offended and cried/guilt tripped us into whatever. Sometimes she would just get up and leave for her room and leave us there haha! 

She would get an idea like “oh we can sign up the baby for this and that!” And right away start trying to buy whatever she saw without once asking us if we were okay with it. 

She would buy concert tickets for her favorite band for all of us without once asking if we wanted to go or if we were available, then she would try to guilt trip us into feeling bad. She did this kind of stuff a lot. Then she would get angry we couldn’t go. Btw I will add she goes to see the same two bands with her husband every year and her husband hates them but she doesn’t care nor does she takes him to see one of the bands he likes. 

Her tv is always on with politics or whatever band she likes (they are like punk/hippies kind of ppl) and her husband can never change it unless she is not home. And every vacation is what she wants, any activity they do is what she wants and all his days off are for her. 

She would just show up at my house unannounced and one time even brought her friend I had never met and got my son to unlock the door for her. One of the only times I lost my shit and screamed at her and kicked her out. lol sorry I was sick, nursing the baby, and NOT EVEN MY BFF just walks in. Like we’re not a 90s sitcom get out of here with that lady! 

She asked my husband to cancel a trip we took for Halloween to Oregon/WA area because “you’re taking my granddaughter away in my favorite holiday” bishhhhhh whattt. Also if you live in the states and haven’t seen those forests, you should, they are beautiful!!! 

She tried to guilt trip us for eloping and not having a wedding and not inviting her when all we did was sign a paper and didn’t do a celebration. Again, not even my best friend was there. And I did tell mother in law to come she just said no. 

She tried guilt tripping my husband when we made the decision to move to Orlando although she knew the job he got offered was life changing and Jersey was getting unaffordable. 

They came to visit in Orlando and she acted like she owned the house and disrespected our rules with the kids and kept on making remarks like “you have so many rules” or talking to the kids like “your mom (meaning me) is not gonna allow you or your mom has all these rules”. She spilled coffee on my new couch which was an accident and got up and went into the room they were staying in while her husband right away started cleaning. It took the two of us like 40 min to clean up the whole mess and she was nowhere to be found. The would go take naps and meanwhile we had to just pause and wait for her to decide she wanted to go out. It was very annoying. I will add I’m actually a very chill parent. The rules I have are just basic human rules man nothing crazy! 

Anyway here comes the last straw. A few months ago I noticed her FB profile picture was a picture of her with the kids. Cute right? Well no, because we have a no kids on social media policy. The world is dark and I don’t want the kids exposed. I also think they should be old enough to allow their own picture on social media. She knows this. Yet she doesn’t care. We asked her to take it down kindly and explained why and she ignored it. We asked her again, and she said she has already done so. She hadn’t. In fact I noticed she added it to her instagram. So I sent her a message and she ignored it. My husband asked her again and she answered with “FINE! I’ll take it down! Are you happy now??” And she changed the profile picture to a heart with cactus texture but kept the picture up. Like dude just stop. A cactus really? She told me she didn’t see the messages (she replied to some of them) and that she wasn’t tech savvy and couldn’t take it down. The thing is she is a very talented graphic/ fine artist and she uses photoshop all the time and is very active on social media. So again, just stop. Anyway, I was livid, and my husband finally saw the way she truly is. He knew obviously since she raised him to be very insecure and never let him do anything that she didn’t like herself, but he was still blinded to a point. He was so angry she lied to his face and refuses to respect our rule as parents. I sent her a very angry message finally standing up to her for her years of what felt like bullying and gaslighting and I also mentioned things my husband had said about the way he was raised which also made my skin crawl. I called her selfish and a narcissist and told her wasn’t welcomed but her husband was lol the poor man. 
The answer I got was “I didn’t know! I did nothing wrong” and she got her husband whom I loved and had a very good relationship with to belittle me and call me all kinds of shit. I get it, that’s your wife, but I never knew he was blinded to her manipulation. I always thought he hated his life of servitude but I guess he doesn’t even notice. It was very hurtful the things he said and yes I cried, and yes for a second I was gaslighted into thinking I was the one in the wrong. He even said I had a joined their family just to destroy and that was my plan all along. Righttt. 
But my husband reassured me I wasn’t crazy. He finally opened up to me about details of his life with them. He said every time he had ever stood up to his mom she would cry and do crazy shit like pull a knife on herself like “do y want me to die?” Stuff like that and he would get yelled at by his blinded dad. So he learnt to never stand for himself. I realized he was so broken and in a way the whole mess helped me have way more compassion for him and got us closer together. Which is funny to me because his mom’s behavior caused us to have arguments in the past yet finally dealing with it helped us. 

Long story short haha sorry! We have both cut them off. I have zero contact and I’m at peace in my relationship due to it. I do feel bad sometimes because her and I were friends at some point and I know she’s not evil. The situation with the dad is the one that truly hurts because I have always held him very high as one of my favorite ppl. He means a lot to me. Unfortunately she is a narcissist and he is her enabler of 30+ years. He lives for her and kisses the ground she walks on and I will never win. And that’s okay. I wish things were different but I know in order to “fix it”
I have to basically say I was wrong and she is perfect and refuse. My husband also cut them off and has very little contact if any. Like a picture here and a “yes I am alive and well” there. I told him it was his choice to have them in his life or not but I won’t be there and he respects that. He actually tried opening up to his dad about his trauma with her but all he got was “gotcha” and he realized maybe he was never gonna get there with them. 

So am the asshole for cutting them off? For not allowing them to visit anymore? I wish there was a middle ground but I tried that for a year with very low contact and it didn’t help. 

Thanks for reading!!! 
  
Also I couldn’t correct the misspells so bear with me this app wasn’t being nice haha. And I will add his parents are those kind of humans that refuse to grow up. They are eccentric and artistic and very much still in their 80s punk era but like in their 60s, which is cool but also totally not. My husband and I are also what you can consider eccentric artists but we wear our parent/ adult hats when we have to. They don’t. 

Okay now I’m done thank you for allowing 
me to vent! Looking forward to see what you guys think. ❤️ Also Charlotte you’re beautiful and awesome 😎 just saying ",1,1728741906.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

Although I love my friends, we’ve known each other for so long I feel like there are some parts of my life that I can’t share with them because I feel these parts of me contradict their general idea of me. 

On the surface, I look like I’ve got it all together, and while I enjoy my independence, I have to admit that it gets lonely sometimes. I live alone, and most of the daily socialisation I get is at work - ugh, it is such a toxic boys club - so all I want is an earnest, long-distance girly friendship / relationship where we can have a good #nofilter, (but not necessarily NSFW) chat. I want to be someone’s non-judgmental confessional booth. I want to know what you are eating for breakfast and what book you are reading. I want to share a spotify playlist with you and receive all your irrelevant memes at all hours of the day and night. I want to know all about you. 

A little about me, I work in finance, and have mixed feelings about my work. I’m a night-owl transitioning into a morning person, so I force myself to wake early for that cup of morning coffee before driving myself to the gym. I then spend most of my time at work. After work, I try my best to make myself a healthy dinner. Or i’ll just order two whole pizzas and finish all of them by myself. I like classical music and the Euphoria soundtrack lol. I am a massive trivia nerd. I also like lounging and reading in the sun by the side of the pool. I am looking for someone in the same phase of life as me so we can bitch about toxic men and recount our days. No men please, I’ve had enough of them.

It'll slowly drop your ferritin and maybe you'll become anemic after like, 20 years of that bad diet sustained. 

A few months ago I got my blood work done and saw I had 10.3 hemoglobin (male btw so it's worse). I, my dad, and the doctor all thought it's because of diet. We barely eat meat and I consume a shit ton of coffee and diary which inhibit iron absorption. 

I'll spare you the details, but I couldn't be farther from the truth. Yes, my diet was bad. But I also had H. Pylori for at least 5 years. H. Pylori is a stomach bacteria that lies dormant but can be irritated and start to deplete your vitamins and minerals. 

So yeah, always try to find your root cause. 

P.S: for the women too, don't let your doctor gaslight you into thinking it's ""normal"" or ""it's just because of periods"". That's highly unlikely, talking to an anemic woman who was diagnosed with heavy periods, she explained that they felt completely different to regular ones. You'd know something is up if it's just your period.

Last Friday they shipped 20,000lbs of bottled water into WNC and because I have my CDL, I volunteered to take it. I typically always stop and get a coffee in the mornings in a drive thru but because I left so early, no one would have been open locally outside of Starbucks and I no offense, don’t drink that ‘crap’.

Ok cool, life moves on, no coffee today—except what came later in the day was total misery. Exhaustion, irritability, skin crawlies and by the end of the day, a pounding headache and restlessness. I almost always fall asleep in +/- 15 minutes but for some reason, it took me an hour that night. Since I had such a bad time and assumed it was the coffee, I decided to stop drinking it because I felt penalized by caffeine for skipping a day.

Since then (over a week or so), I’ve noticed the following things about myself: Less brain fog/way more mental clarity and sharpness, faster and heavier sleep, dreaming almost every night which is something I typically don’t do, stronger appetite and overall I just feel what is seemingly way better.

I knew coffee everyday had become a senseless problem but it became a lifestyle choice and habit more than anything. I went my entire life without coffee until I started driving trucks over the road about five years ago.

I’d highly suggest kicking the habit if you suspect coffee is causing you some sort of issue(s). It’s worth exploring it for your own self health.",1,1728741469.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

She suffered a traumatic brain injury and is only 17 years old. The parents are struggling a lot mentally (understandably). Myself and one other colleague have been a crutch in some form for them as we have shown genuine care for their daughter as well as their family. We often give emotional support to the parents when things get difficult, so therefore we have both formed a close rapport with the parents. This other colleague always goes above and beyond for the parents (bringing gifts for them/daughters, cooking them lunch, bringing them coffees, organising stock for the client etc.). It is very nice of her and the family appreciate it a lot. She brings me gifts as well, I think it is how she communicates additional support. However, I’m starting to find it a bit unfair. Not that this is a competition at all but I feel as though she is able to win them over more easily, and they automatically start to favour her. I’ve noticed the last few times I worked with her, I find myself feeling left out. Her and the parents talk about things that they have discussed over the phone out of working hours as well as when she brings gifts she is showered with appreciation, praise, thank you’s, and hugs. I feel awkward because I feel like she is raising the standard, I don’t want to have to give people gifts but it makes me feel like I’m not as generous or thoughtful. I don’t know what to do, I work and interact with her a lot more than other people do and I’ve started to notice that she may not be as genuine as she makes out to be (fabricating stories to make them funnier/dramatic, talking crap about other colleagues, taking credit for my ideas).

1g20nso,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1g20nso/should_i_keep_this_going/,Should I keep this going?,"I apologize for this long ass post but yall need the deetz

Backstory: Me 22F and him 20M met through friends while he was visiting my city during the summer. Nothing happened between us until I made a move. Later found out he didn’t pursue me at first because he assumed me and my guy friend had something going on smh. We ended up really connecting throughout the week. Honestly felt like meeting a soulmate the amount of similarities we had was insane. He expressed how he wanted to try long-distance. He had very serious expectations and communicated all of them thoroughly.  I was very impressed w how emotionally intelligent/mature he was. When he returned to his city, we talked and agreed to be exclusive. 

Fast forward to present day, 4 months into this relationship. he’s starting to really confuse me. I feel like leaving this relationship to protect myself even though he’s my dream man

Pros 
-He told me he wants me to be his girlfriend and has even called me his wife a couple of times (he dates to marry). We aren’t officially bf & gf, though, because he says he knows women expect a huge romantic gesture when asked that question. Seems like he’s waiting until we’re in-person and I believe him bc he tried to ask me out twice but then changed his mind and told me to wait on answering. 

-When I bring up issues, he tries to resolve them and tries to change. Continuously says, “See, I’m changing.” to get me to acknowledge him stepping up.

-When we’re having issues and I ask him if he’d keep talking to me if he began losing interest, he says, “I’m not that type of person; I would have left.” He says he doesn’t like to waste anyone’s time and tells me not to overthink.

-He told me he’s extremely busy and that he met me at a time when he didn’t want a relationship but “then he met me.”

-When he parties, he calls to reassure me that he’s not cheating (not that I need him to, but it’s still sweet). One of these times was during this national festival that people in our culture attend once a year; also notorious for people looking for relationships/hookups. Since we both date within our culture, him going to a festival full of baddies made me a lil nervous nglll but I never told him that. He invited me to go to the festival with him, and his fam/friends would be there too. I didn’t go, but he still called me the whole time without me asking.

Cons:
-doesn’t give me meaningful compliments, Pet names and calling me beautiful isn’t enough for me.

-He has trouble with being consistent on ft calls. I expect daily communication, even just a 5-min check-in. We agreed to let each other know if anything comes up. He’s super busy with school and work but has a social life too which I respect but feel like he could prioritize giving me more of his time. I’ve had this conversation with him 3 times. He improves for a while, then slips when he gets busy. By slip I mean I catch him making time for other ppl before me. This is our biggest issue. He’s been better lately, but time will tell. It’s crazy that I even have to tell him to call me daily for 5 min tho :( The last 2 times we had the convo, I told him I might not want to be exclusive anymore to set a consequence, but yo girl failed to follow through lol.

-Since we met, he’s been on multiple trips, and he says he plans to visit me. Yet, for his upcoming winter break from university, he gave me a dumb excuse for why he might not be able to come, even though we agreed on it. The excuse was so bad that I would have preferred for him to just be honest, especially since I can be flexible with visits given we’re both students.

-lack of romantic gestures/gifts since we’ve been apart. He did pay for things when we were together that week and sent me $8 randomly on ft for coffee loll, but still no flowers :/ not even on my bday. I acknowledge I sent his bday gift a month late but only bc it was handmade and I was rlly busy. 

-I sent his birthday gift to his friend’s house, and he said his friend “lost it.” Double homicide because I included a note expressing my feelings. I don’t believe him tho. I haven’t told him there’s a note in there.

-One time, I was at one of our mutual friend’s apartments sewing something. mutual friend gets a group phone call, and he’s on the call. they were discussing plans for our mutual friend to visit his city. All of our friends know we’re “together” in a way. Anyways, our mutual friend tells him to say hey to me (because they didn’t know I was in the room), and I don’t hear anything. Next thing I know, I look up at the phone, and he’s gone. His friend (the one I shipped the gift to) is laughing at me but won’t say what 4. Then he starts talking to me a little, but I’m getting bad vibes, wondering if they were laughing at him leaving or something else. That night I went home, ready to end the relationship again, but then he ft me the next day in front of them all affectionate, so here I am, confused again. I haven’t talked to him about how much it bothered me. I just mentioned that I knew he was on the phone, and he said, “Yeah, I didn’t know you were there. I came to put my 2 cents in the convo and left.” So, even though it felt off, I let it go.

My wedding is very soon. While I love my fiancé so much, I'm feeling incredibly anxious. My anxiety has been so bad that I wake up at 4am feeling like I've had 6 cups of coffee an hour prior. In the beginning, I knew I wanted a longer engagement. When I communicated this to my fiancé, he was really confused and hurt. So, I compromised. You see, I am already divorced. I married very young and we divorced years later mutually and peacefully. Yet, it was excruciatingly painful. One major fear is that I didn't allow myself enough time to process my divorce and grief afterwards. Many feelings of sadness hit me during our engagement and, esp., marital counseling. I felt like I was a young adult again except with a different person and a brand new future. That was so painful; it felt like I woke up from a dream I had lived out wholeheartedly. My therapist told me that it's completely normal and my feelings are valid. Additionally, I would forever live far from my family. They're across the country and my fiancé wants to stay close to his family. He believes we would have greater security; he's probably right. This is so difficult for me. 

Here is how I can organize the source of my feelings best:

On a scale of 1-10,

How much of my anxiety comes from thoughts regarding the future: 10

How much of my anxiety comes from thoughts questioning the character of my future husband: 3.9 (while some of this is valid, a lot of my fears are mostly due to trauma)

How much of my anxiety comes directly from my relationship with my FH: 3.5 (differences in beliefs, how we operate, think, etc)

How much of my anxiety comes from worries about FH's family relationship with me: 6.3

How much of my anxiety comes from living away from family permanently: 10

How much of my anxiety comes from living a different future than initially thought: 7.8

How much of my anxiety comes from worrying I will be restricted: 8.7

If I choose to cancel my wedding, how much anxiety comes from pondering possible consequences: 10

What do you think you would do if you were me knowing my FH and his family helped with most of the wedding costs and planning, etc? I feel sick to my stomach thinking about how this will affect my FH. He truly loves me. I truly love him. I just feel like it's all happening so fast. Like I'm on a rollercoaster that won't stop.

Here are some tips that really helped me!,"Given that IB recruiting season has officially kicked off, just wanted to offer some general tips on navigating the recruiting process, and create a general space for people to share their tips. I'm an ex-BB banker who received a lot of help breaking in. Now that I've got some time on my hands, I want to help others do the same!

1. **Focus on specific industries/groups when networking**: From my experience, the most successful candidates were those that wanted to focus on a specific industries. If you are focused on certain industries, you'll appear more knowledgeable + genuinely seem more interested.
2. **Prepare for every coffee chat like its an interview**: Your goal should not be to maximize the number of coffee chats you have, but the number of good/memorable coffee chats you have. I prepared for every single chat as if it was an actual interview, and it paid off. If someone is taking time out of their busy day to have this chat with you, it's only polite to be just as prepared. People can tell.
3. **Prepare for technicals already!** One thing I neglected was preparing for technicals. You should start preparing for technicals earlier for two reasons:
   1. You never know when your coffee chat might turn technical. If you have decent market knowledge and you bring up good deals in the market, you might get probed on those deals. I definitely felt like an idiot the first time when I couldn't follow up my initial market knowledge with any substantial conversation. Interviews start hitting a lot quicker than you might realize. Interviews come in waves, and you don't want interviews to start hitting and you're only just preparing to interview.
   2. Coffee chats can sometimes turn into interviews very quickly. I had some coffee chats that directly led to me being passed on for formal interviews, and those (especially for the non-NYC offices) can come right away.
4. **Table-stakes:** And finally -- your resume needs to be flawless (just check your grammar!). Everyone has great grades and is president/portfolio manager of some student-led investment club on campus. Analysts have hundreds of resumes to sort through, and don't want to give them any reason to toss yours out.

Because it seems like Oppenheimer has cracked the code to predicting stock market outcomes with the precision of a psychic at a state fair. They've slapped a whopping 'strong buy' on two stocks, with one possibly primed for a staggering 740% rally. Now, before you raid your piggy banks or start turning couch cushions upside down for loose change, let’s take a comedic plunge into what’s really going on here.

First, let's chat about Rani Therapeutics. These guys have created the RaniPill, a pill that sounds like it was named after someone’s beloved grandmother. But this isn't just any pill—it's designed to survive the treacherous journey through the acidic whirlpool of your stomach to deliver drugs right where they need to go. It’s like FedEx for your intestines, ensuring your biologics are delivered on time and to the right place, without any spillage. Their magic bean promises to transform the delivery of drugs, making it easier than drinking your morning coffee—provided, of course, you aren’t already jittering from all that pre-workout caffeine.

Now, the promised land of stock growth: a whopping 740% increase. If you're having trouble visualizing that, just imagine every dollar invested stretching out to nearly eight times its original length. You could almost hear every finance bro’s heart skip a beat. The best part? Rani's stock is trading so low, you might find more money in your washing machine's lint trap. This is the kind of stock that could turn your gloomy portfolio into the life of the Wall Street party—because nothing says ‘rags to riches’ like betting on a company that’s trying to turn your stomach into a drug mule.

Switching gears, let’s talk about Ultra Clean Holdings (UCTT). These folks are serving up everything you need to make semiconductors, which are pretty much the secret sauce in everything from your smartphone to your car’s increasingly digital dashboard. Ultra Clean isn’t just playing in the sandbox, they’re selling the shovels in a gold rush for chips. And with AI demands exploding like popcorn kernels in hot oil, they're poised to be the unsung heroes of the tech boom.

Their recent earnings had them smashing expectations like a toddler in a china shop. It’s like watching a sleeper athlete suddenly dominate at the Olympics. The company’s forward-looking projections are giving Wall Street the kind of warm and fuzzy feelings usually reserved for videos of puppies learning to walk. And with a potential upside of 76%, investing in UCTT might just be the kind of fiscal acrobatics that could have you flipping from red to black.

But, as always, the big ‘but’—it’s important to remember that investing on the back of such bold predictions requires the kind of nerve usually reserved for horror movie protagonists. Remember, the stock market can be as predictable as a cat on catnip. Sure, Oppenheimer's analysts are waving their ""strong buy"" banners like cheerleaders at a pep rally, but always do your own homework—because the last thing you want is your financial future depending on the equivalent of a magic 8-ball.

So, there you have it. Whether you’re looking to turn your stomach into a drug delivery drone or bank on the unsung heroes of the semiconductor world, Oppenheimer’s latest picks could either be your ticket to the moon or a spectacular dive into the kiddie pool.

# Tips for Crafting the Perfect Out of Office Message

* **Keep it Concise**: No one wants to read a lengthy email response. Keep your out of office message short and direct.
* **Use Keywords Naturally**: If applicable, include keywords like ""out of office email message"" or ""away from office message"" naturally in your response. It can help if someone searches for such terms in email or internal databases.
* **Include an Alternative Contact**: This prevents frustration for the email sender and helps them get a resolution faster.
* **Don’t Over Share**: You don’t need to provide every detail about why you’re out. A simple timeframe is usually enough.
* **Maintain Professionalism**: Even if using humor, ensure it is appropriate for your work environment.

# Best Practices for Setting Up Out of Office Replies

1. **Activate at the Right Time**: Make sure to activate your out of office message before leaving, not after. This is especially important if you have international contacts who may be in different time zones.
2. **Specify Availability**: Always include the exact dates you are unavailable. If possible, mention when you will resume replying to emails.
3. **Provide Solutions**: If your absence means delays, suggest alternative solutions, such as other contacts who can help or links to resources.
4. **Set Expectations**: Let people know if you will have limited access to email and how soon they can expect a response.

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

* **Vagueness**: A vague message like ""I'm out"" can frustrate the sender. Always include return dates and alternative contacts.
* **Inappropriate Tone**: Choose your tone based on your audience. Humor is great, but it isn’t suitable for all work environments.
* **Lack of Backup Contact**: Not including an alternative contact person can result in missed opportunities or frustrated clients.

# Optimizing Your Out of Office Message for SEO

1g205xf,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1g205xf/my_long_distance_relationship_ended_and_ill_never/,My Long Distance Relationship Ended And I'll Never Get Answers,"Hi reddit, long-time lurker, occasional commenter here.

I've never posted anything personal to a forum before, but I think getting some outside perspective could help with my heartache and confusion.

I (34m- D)recently had a 3 month long distance relationship end with a girl (34f- L) that I met in my home city at my job near our convention center. She was here to work a large gaming convention and was picking up packages with her boss for their booth.

I was immediately smitten and decided to shoot my shot by talking with her and her boss as I helped them load up their rental truck. She apparently felt similarly and emphasized multiple time that I should come visit their booth. I eventually worked up the courage to attend one of the days, with the help of two good friends accompanying me.

From there we talked, added each other on socials and she immediately made it known that she liked me and was willing to try a long distance relationship out (I've never had one before this, but due to the nature of her career she travels a lot so she has had multiple in the past.) 

The first month was incredible: constant conversation through texting, hour and hours of phone convos about anything and everything, personal stories and not easily shared secrets etc. The entire time I was just in disbelief that someone this emotionally and physically scarred in her past, could be so strong and motivated to see the good in others, let alone be attracted to me. I'm not ugly by conventional standards, but my self-confidence has never been great.
Meanwhile this girl is an 11/10 on the attraction scale, and she is loved by everyone that meets her through work.

We planned to see each other for another convention over a month away after she left my city, but shortly after she had cosmetic surgery done a couple weeks after leaving, she asked if she could come visit me for a weekend because she took a month off work to recover and really missed me and wanted to see me sooner. I was elated and agreed.
The visit was mostly great, other than the fact I still had to work (retail environment) so she would stay in the hotel room and work on her laptop or rest until I would get back. 

There was one blemish on the trip where I was working and we were texting as usual, when my self-concious started wondering why her texts were shorter and not as enthusiastic as before she visited, so my mean brain started worrying that I was boring, not entertaining enough for her and maybe she was second guessing being with me. This was my fuck up and I apologized for my lack of self-confidence after insinuating she wasn't responding how she normally had been up to that point. She was really quiet when I got back to the hotel and said nothing was wrong but she was thinking. 
When something upsets her, she goes quiet for hours sometimes until she has time to think about how she feels, which isn't a bad trait, but I'm the type to work through my emotions by talking about them sooner than later because otherwise I dwell on them and negative feelings will fester with my overreacting imagination.

Following this visit, we still talked and texted pretty much like normal and still had plans for the upcoming con that we originally planned to visit together. Then another situation upset her when I shared a conversation topic with one of my friends that she considered to be a breach of trust and was really upset by. Essentially I shared fictional chatacters that she was attracted to and not in a patronizing way, because I have my fair share too, and so does my friend: we're all pervy nerds with needs and no one was being judgemental but when I mentioned this conversation with L, she got really upset and sent me a VERY long text about how she knows what real monsters are and they are people you walk by in plain sight, and that she didn't like that my friend jokingly said ""oh, she's a monster fucker"" in relation to the characters L likes (typically misunderstood villains) 

After this episode she told me didn't feel safe with me and doesn't know if she can trust me. I apologized profusely and explained that there was no judgement about her interests, and that I was just gushing about my gf to a friend that I trust and she also met and liked.

From here the energy in the relationship really started to change. She would start questioning why was I always so sexual with her (she gets a lot of gross attention when working but laughs it off when being professional) and I would respond confused because she was encouraging it and responding in kind until she suddenly decided she didn't want to anymore. 

The night before she was flying in for us to drive to the aforementioned con, she told me she wasn't excited for the trip and felt like she wouldn't enjoy being alone with me and this was an echo of when she said she didn't feel safe with me. As a guy dating a girl who has been sexually assaulted and abused, I was hyper aware that my body language and words could easily be threatening to someone that has trauma of that nature. I'm also a fairly big guy and I've always been a gentle giant because of one traumatizing accident as a kid when I accidentally hurt a girl by falling on her during recess and making her cry. I hate hurting people or making them uncomfortable by my presence so I am very aware of my surroundings and other people's body language. 

The trip happened, we spent a lot of time together and with her friends and all the people that know her in the industry. She gets compliments wherever we would go, although guys didn't hit on her as much because I was next to her (which she specifically pointed out to me)
We slept in the same bed together but we never had sex, and really only one time did we do anything sexual back on the first time she visited me. She at one point on the last night asked if I still liked her which I adamantly stated yes and that I loved her immensely but she was sad that I wasn't being more affectionate when she explicitly told me she didn't feels safe with me, which I understood to mean she wasn't comfortable with me being sexual with her anymore. I was so confused by her shifts in tone and wants when all trip long I would ask if I could give her a hug or kiss her, because I didn't want to assume she would be okay with it.

That was the last time I saw her in person. We still talked a lot but her answers became shorter and the enthusiasm for the relationship dwindled. She started telling me she was worried she would never get back the feelings she had for me, and at one time during the con trip, she said "" I don't like using this word, but part of me wants to have sex with you and the other part says you give me the 'ick'"" and I'll be honest, that shit broke my heart. 

I'm a hopeless romantic and I definitely gave my heart to her because it felt like there was a mutual love and understanding between us, but as time went on I started to realize that while I've seen therapists and professional help for my depression and anxiety, L used staying super busy with multiple jobs, co parenting her two children and doing anything else to keep her from confronting all the dark and negative shadows in her mind and past.

The final and first reason for this post is that she broke up with me three weeks ago but immediately said she hated this and missed me so much, but then would go silent when I would respond in kind. She asked me if I was still sad about the breakup and I said yes and asked why she wanted to know. She said she was curious if I was moving on, which I asked ""would you prefer if I did?"" Her answer: I don't think so but you can make your own decision... like what the hell kind of answer is that? 
A week after the breakup we are still talking normally sans the affection, but we still tell each other that we love the other.The second morning she's there, she tells me about a guy asking her on a date and another guy she's working with that used to have a thing for her and so did she. All men are trash but some kind ones exist like the coffee date guy(her words). It felt like she was trying to make me jealous but she said she didn't mean to.

I eventually had a realization that she was stringing me along and possibly using me for attention  (the stuff she hates from guys in general and complains about, but doesn't mind when they give her free gifts because oh they're just being really nice) so I asked to have time to talk on the phone when we're both home and rested. Instead she calls me while I'm at work after I previously stated twice that I had a terrible day and was at work nearly 3 hours after close with another coworker. She was definitely at the airport so neither of us were in a good environment or mood for the talk I wanted to have. She calls me immediately when she forced me to tell her what I wanted to talk about ""about the breakup, post-breakup and needs/expectations going forward"" because I can't just be a friend so soon after a breakup and she is still acting like she wants to be with me.
I calmly told L on the phone that I was still at work, that I was hangry and exhausted and could we please talk another time that week. She says okay then and hangs up on me. I text her apologizing if my tone came off as cold but that I needed her to take this seriously and to let me know when she could talk that week. She then tells me she doesn't want to talk to me anymore after that conversation and to have a goodnight D, hope you feel better soon D, drive safe and hope you have a great night D"" which seemed WILDLY out of proportion of a response to my very civil request to talk. She then said sorry you always seem to get hurt when I'm away working. Tries to explain that she was calling to talk about planning to talk and that she was worried about me, when all days she didn't text any concern at all until I apparently upset her with wanting to have a real talk about what she wanted from me.

I'll never get those answers now as she has been radio silent for almost two weeks and I know that once she makes a decision she won't go back on it. I guess in hindsight the relationship wouldn't have worked because she has so many triggers, doesn't let people into her heart but has a whole bunch of admirers and acquaintances but not many real close friends or confidantes. I think she's scared of being hurt to the point that she unintentionally sabotages any relationship she could possibly have and falls too easily for 'nice' guys that treat her nice, which is wild to me because if you've ever been sexually abused, let alone by multiple people since you were a teenager, you should be a lot more skeptical about people being nice to you so much. Pretty privilege is a blessing and a curse for this girl.

I am no perfect angel, but I own my fuck ups and will hopefully take what I learned from this relationship going forward as good lessons on things to avoid. I just can't help that I still love and care about L, because I know she's hurting deep inside, but I can't help her and she doesn't want it from me, nor does she think she needs professional help. It breaks my heart that we weren't meant to be, and late at night and early mornings when I can't sleep, all I think about is what could I have done differently (cry a bunch) and hope she finds real growth and recovery. Life has been so hard on her and I just want her to be happy even if it isn't with me. 

Thanks for listening to my rant.

Another subcontractor - a guy my age - arrived a couple of hours in to complete a telecommunications installation. He introduced himself and talked as I continued what I was doing, blah, blah, blah … I took note of where he would be working and replied, “No problem, I can work around you” and carried on. At one point, he offered to treat us to coffee or whatever - no thanks. I just kept doing my work. 

After we packed up for the day and headed home, my son pointed out that the guy had been peacocking, presumably for my benefit. After his coffee break, the dude apparently came back smelling of freshly applied cologne … I didn’t notice. My son also remarked that the guy found opportunities to work in my vicinity, and tried to strike up a conversation. I recall him making the odd friendly comment here or there throughout the day … I wasn’t rude, just basically grey rocked him, I guess. My son pointed out a couple of other small details that I hadn’t noticed. 

It’s pretty telling when your adult son has to alert you that a random guy in the wild is trying to initiate some sort of connection. Thinking back objectively, there was nothing at all wrong with the dude: he was well groomed, pleasant and friendly and respected my work space, drove a nice truck/trailer that was clean and well maintained, takes excellent care of his tools (my last three observations are very telling when it comes to guys working in the trades). But … I just didn’t care.

1g1zzpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1g1zzpp/the_perfect_pair_how_to_combine_home_decor_and/,The Perfect Pair: How to Combine Home Decor and Furniture for a Stylish Space,"Creating a stylish, cohesive home is all about finding the perfect balance between home decor items and home furniture. The key is to combine function with beauty, resulting in a space that feels both comfortable and aesthetically pleasing. Whether you're furnishing a new home or refreshing your current one, this guide will show you how to combine decor and furniture seamlessly, making your home a true reflection of your style.

**1. Start with a Coordinated Color Palette**

The foundation of a well-designed space is a consistent color palette. Your [home furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) and decor should work together to establish a harmonious look. Choose a base color for your larger furniture pieces like sofas, [bar stools](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/bar-stools), and [coffee tables](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/coffee-tables). Then, use complementary or contrasting colors for home decor items like pillows, vases, or rugs to add dimension.

Tip: If your living room has neutral-colored furniture, such as a beige or gray sofa, introduce pops of color with home decor items like cushions or wall art. This contrast creates a visually appealing balance without overwhelming the space.

**2. Balance Function with Style**

While home decor items enhance your home’s appearance, they should also serve a functional purpose. Choose decor that complements the functionality of your furniture. For instance, a coffee table should have space for decorative items like books or vases but also be practical for everyday use.

Example: Pair your kitchen island with stylish bar stools that not only provide seating but also enhance the room’s design. Adding decor like a ceramic bowl or a hanging light above the island will bring in personality while maintaining utility.

 **3. Use Lighting as a Design Feature**

Lighting plays a crucial role in tying [home decor](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) and furniture together. Layering different types of lighting, such as pendant lights and hanging lights, creates both ambiance and visual interest. These lighting elements can also serve as statement pieces in a room.

Tip: Use pendant lights over dining tables or kitchen islands to define the space and add elegance. Hanging lights in living areas or hallways create a cozy yet stylish atmosphere, drawing attention to your furniture and decor. Pair these with soft lighting from table or floor lamps to create depth and warmth.

**4. Mix Textures for Depth and Contrast**

When combining home decor and furniture, incorporating different textures can add depth and visual interest to your space. A mix of smooth, rough, glossy, and matte finishes creates contrast and makes a room feel dynamic. 

Tip: If your home furniture is primarily wooden or metal, such as a sleek dining table or bar stools, introduce soft textiles like cushions, throws, or curtains. Layering a textured rug beneath a solid coffee table adds warmth and dimension to the room. Pairing smooth pendant lights with textured lampshades can also add contrast while keeping the lighting consistent.

 **5. Incorporate Statement Pieces**

One or two statement pieces can serve as focal points in your home, adding a bold touch to an otherwise balanced design. Whether it’s a bold piece of furniture or an oversized decor item, statement pieces can elevate your space without overwhelming it.

Example: A striking [pendant light](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights) or a [hanging light](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights) fixture can act as a statement piece in your dining or living area. Similarly, bold-colored bar stools in a kitchen or home bar can create a stylish focal point, especially when combined with subtle home decor items like candles, trays, or vases.

**6. Seasonal Swaps for a Fresh Look**

To keep your space feeling fresh, swap out smaller home decor items seasonally. This allows you to refresh your room’s look without the need to replace major furniture pieces. It’s an easy way to update your space and keep it in style year-round.

Tip: Change your cushions, throws, or even your pendant light shades according to the season. For summer, opt for light, airy fabrics, and for winter, go for rich, textured materials like velvet or wool. Keeping your core home furniture neutral makes it easier to switch out decor items without disrupting the overall flow of the room.

Finding the perfect pair between [home decor items](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) and home furniture comes down to balance and coordination. Whether you’re selecting pendant lights to match your dining table or bar stools that complement your kitchen island, the goal is to blend aesthetics with functionality. By focusing on a unified color palette, incorporating diverse textures, and using statement pieces wisely, you can create a space that is both stylish and harmonious. With a thoughtful approach to pairing decor and furniture, your home will not only look cohesive but also feel like a true reflection of your unique style.",1,1728739268.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

1g1zz1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/celebrityweightlose/comments/1g1zz1l/the_lost_generator_a_familys_journey_to_energy/,The Lost Generator: A Family's Journey to Energy Independence,"In a small town nestled in the heart of the Midwest, the Jackson family had always lived a simple but fulfilling life. Ben and Emily Jackson, along with their two children, Sarah and Josh, cherished the comfort of their home, surrounded by nature and close-knit neighbors. However, like many American families, they faced the rising costs of electricity and frequent power outages, especially during the intense winter storms that often swept through their region.

It was one particularly harsh winter night when everything changed for the Jacksons. A severe blizzard had hit the town, and the power grid, already weakened by years of underinvestment, went down. With the temperature plummeting and no sign of power returning, the Jacksons found themselves scrambling for warmth. Their gas-powered generator had long since failed, and they were unsure how much longer they could hold out in the freezing cold. That’s when Ben remembered something his colleague, Walker, had mentioned over coffee at work—The Lost Generator.

Walker, a retired electrician from Roanoke, Virginia, had been talking about this seemingly forgotten invention for weeks. It was inspired by none other than the great inventor Thomas Edison, who had once worked on a similar concept during his relentless quest for energy solutions. The Jacksons, desperate for a solution, called Walker immediately. “Ben, you need to try The Lost Generator,” Walker said. “It’s changed my life, and it could change yours, too.”

Ben had always been skeptical of alternative energy solutions. After all, he had considered investing in solar panels, but the cost was astronomical. Yet, Walker reassured him that this was different—The Lost Generator wasn’t just an expensive gimmick but a practical, affordable, and easy-to-build device that anyone could put together with basic materials. It was designed to harness thermal energy and convert it into electricity, drastically cutting down energy costs while offering independence from the grid. And the best part? It could be built in just a few hours.

Curious and with little to lose, Ben decided to give it a shot. Walker sent him the blueprints, and within minutes, Ben was pouring over the step-by-step instructions. Unlike many complex DIY projects, The Lost Generator required no advanced technical skills, just a little bit of patience and determination. With materials sourced from the local hardware store and some guidance from the easy-to-follow manual, Ben set to work in the garage with his teenage son, Josh.

As they worked together, Ben couldn’t help but feel a sense of empowerment. For the first time, they weren’t just waiting for help from the power company or scrambling to survive—they were taking control of their own energy future. The blueprints, though simple, were based on a clever design inspired by one of Edison’s old, forgotten experiments, which involved using heat to produce electricity. The device was portable, eco-friendly, and best of all, it could generate enough power to keep their essentials running during an emergency.

[The Lost Generator](https://preview.redd.it/ysklpvvop9ud1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=a661aedad58f4c1f830e2d3422d5eecd61605344)

It took Ben and Josh just under two hours to assemble the generator. They followed the detailed schematics, which laid out every step clearly. When the moment came to fire up The Lost Generator, Ben felt a surge of excitement and nervousness. But when the device whirred to life and began producing electricity, that anxiety turned into sheer relief. They had done it—they had built their own source of energy, and just in time, as the house had begun to cool dangerously.

The next few days were a game-changer for the Jackson family. While the rest of the neighborhood struggled through the blackout, the Jacksons had heat, light, and the ability to keep their food fresh. Sarah, who was initially skeptical of her dad’s DIY project, was now grateful that they didn’t have to bundle up under blankets for warmth like their friends next door. Ben couldn’t help but feel proud—not only had he provided for his family during a crisis, but he had done it by building something with his own hands.

Word spread quickly in their town. Neighbors like the O’Connors and the Simmses came knocking on their door, asking about this mysterious device. Emily, always the gracious host, invited them in to see it firsthand. Soon, other families were ordering the blueprints for The Lost Generator, eager to build their own and break free from their reliance on the power grid. Walker, hearing about Ben’s success, couldn’t have been more thrilled. “I told you it would change your life,” he said over the phone, laughing.

But the story of The Lost Generator wasn’t just about one town’s fight against rising energy costs or a family surviving a winter storm. It was about something much bigger. Across the country, people like the Jacksons were waking up to the reality that energy independence was within their grasp. Whether it was the preppers in California, worried about wildfires, or eco-conscious families in Oregon wanting to reduce their carbon footprint, the simple, ingenious design of The Lost Generator was spreading like wildfire.

For Ben, the biggest takeaway wasn’t just the money he was saving on his electricity bills—although that was a huge benefit. It was the peace of mind that came from knowing he could protect his family during the toughest times. Whether it was a snowstorm, a hurricane, or even just a minor power outage, he knew he had a reliable source of power. And that sense of independence, of knowing he wasn’t at the mercy of the energy companies or the aging infrastructure, was priceless.

As the Jacksons settled back into their daily routine, Ben couldn’t help but think about the future. Maybe one day, they’d invest in solar panels or explore other forms of renewable energy. But for now, The Lost Generator had given them exactly what they needed—energy independence, peace of mind, and a glimpse into a future where they were in control.

**The story of The Lost Generator was just beginning, and for families like the Jacksons, it was a story of hope, empowerment, and resilience.** [**https://thelostgenerator.com/**](https://freezegluco.com/LostGenerator.html)",1,1728739209.0,celebrityweightlose,0,1.0,False

We've always been evaluting solely on quantity and subskills but I belive we should change how we see Ingredients mons and integrate in this evaluation the dishes we want to make....Confused yet? Lemme show you an example to make sure everyone understands.


For bean Sausage the max amount you would need is for the new Salad which requires 28 per dish (84 per day).


So what I do is instead of looking for THE BEST AARON( charizard, etc....) im just trying to find the one who will give me enough beans daily for the best dish so that even when I want to make it someday im sure i wont have to raise a new bean mon.


The 1st pic shows an Aaron with ing S and nature with speed down so most ppl wouldve suggested to look for a better one but ACTUALLY at lvl 30 he is already giving us enough beans so why look for any better??


(2nd pic)There is Also the example of toxicroac and luxray which i wont get in details but it shows that toxicroac with IngM and ( speed up/ing up nature Or ing S) can produce 66 oil (22 per dish) while luxray CAN NEVER produce enough before 60 unless he is perfect (INGM and INGS And helping speed M and nature ing+)

Im gonna assume you are before lvl 60 because at 60 any ingrédient mon with at least 1 Ing bonus(subskill,nature) can reach the requirement for the best dish

The advantages are the following:


-Its easier to find good enough mons rather than perfect ones
- once you find it you are set for life, until the next cooking update and new dishes which Still isnt a problem
-its more fun cuz you dont have to catch the same mon 15 times before finding a sligthly better one.
- You can focus your efforts of catching for SKILLS/BERRY mons which do not have any limit soo you should Totaly find the best possible one
(As a F2P i can only catch 0.5 pokemon per day on average so focusing on berry and skills makes the game a lot easier and faster paced for improvement)


As of today, I see only 2 reasons why you wouldnt agree with me:

1) You want to fill your pot for more than your ingrédient requirement at which point i would still recommend to have a separate farmer for your filler ing (Tails, Shrooms etc..), A vaporeon for max filling,
Or simply have 1 AMAZING pokemon which destroys his limits and has good ingrédients like herbs (at which point you only need 1 and not 2/3 AMAZING ing mon)

2) You want to switch your ing mons as fast as possible for berry mons, this is for extreme min maxers imo but its better for sure I just think most wont bother soo my method still stands for most players.

3) You think the next dishes will have a lot more Ingrédients thus you want more Ingrédients (well at lvl 30 mons have the exact ammount but at 40/50/ and 60 for mono they have a lot more so its not an issue)

I mightve forgotten about some aspects but it should be pretty complete and Im really curious at to why everyone seems to think about the stats and not the dish limit and also any thoughts on what I just explained would be Appreciated and Id love to talk with anyone who wants to.


TLDR: for ing mons look at the max ingredients of the best dish on the official website, and check if your mon AAB or AAA Can reach that requirement at lvl30(if yes its good enough, if no keep looking for another one to invest into).",2,1728739207.0,PokemonSleep,0,1.0,False

I know how stupid that sounds but with everything to make me feel special I’ve had to fight for. 

I felt ignored in every which way. I wanted to be thought of and before our child and house that was sex. Then it became nothing. I’m appreciative of how good of a mother you’ve become but that does not equal good partner. I’ve spent time, money, attention, and energy on you. Dinner dates, a resort vacation to be pampered, shopping, when I have to cover a shift for one of my employees I spend hours on the phone entertaining you, massages at home, paid massages when your back gets bad, every night I’m home you lay on me and I pet your head and rub your back, every morning I’m home you sleep in, every day I’m home you have the option to nap as long as you want when our child sleeps, time out of the house, away from being a mother, and whenever needed the money for the babysitter. Etc. some things like the paid massages may not be as often as you like but I make 70k a year, I’m not rich. 

I asked if you could lay my clothes out or prepare the coffee for mornings when I get home late and wake up early. Immediate pushback on both. I ask if you could take me out on a date and you choose your favorite restaurant lmao wtf and then after we got groceries for the week. And before all that I asked if we could have sex more often (obviously not with those words it was a few long conversations) and it was pushback like I’m some pervert for thinking I’d want to have sex with my partner more than once a month. You’re a SAHM, with one child, money to spend and a partner that has never once left the chores of the home or our child on you. A year after our child’s birth I was sure things would change and it’s only became worse. 

Someone told me I’m selfish and the first five years are basically just accepting a low libido but it comes back. A lot of stories I read say differently. 

I’m falling out of love with you. Is that what you want? House, car, kid, get rid of me and maybe you’ll have it exactly as you want it. I don’t know what to believe anymore. It’s wild how someone cannot care about sex at all. ",5,1728739099.0,DeadBedrooms,1,1.0,False

We have 3 children, Grace (14F), Mackie (11M), and Julie (6). On Monday my daughter told me after school she was going to have a sleepover with her group of friends at their house and I told her it would be ok and to call me once she arrives. Well after school ended she never called and I spammed her phone with texts and calls and after a long time she finally answered and I asked her what took her so long she said she was playing with her friends. I told her it was okay and I was just checking up on her. Fast forward to the afternoon on Tuesday I recieved a notification from the schools text app (It is a app where parents can view their childs account and communicate with teachers) that grace was absent from all her classes and i was getting ready to call grace in a panick when she came in the house and i asked her why she wasnt in school and showed her the notifications, she said she was and maybe her teachers forgot to attendance. While she was talking i smelt a weird scent on her breathe which smelt slightly like vodka and something else unknown. I also noticed she wasnt wearing her normal school fashion of clothing and realized she wahewearing shorts and a crop top. I asked her if she went somewhere she wasnt supposed to, she said she had a sleepover and that her and her friends went to a mutual friends party instead of school. I was livid and told her that she lied to me and her mother and that she could have encountered something dangerous and I punished her by saying she is grounded with no phone for a week and that I'm installing a tracker on her phone as well and that I was not going to pay anymore for any of her girl stuff such as makeup, pads, perfume, lotion, etc which I think is a very light punishment. Fast forward to earlier today, she came to me when I was making coffee and said there was blood on her bed and that she was experiencing cramps. I told her it was maybe because she was at the party and consuming innapropriate substances. She kept complaining about how I was being unfair and I told her since she thinks she is so grown she can pay for her own pads and girl things and I refused to take her to the store or give her any pain medication since she lied and attended a party she then cussed at me and said I was being an ahole and stormed off to her room.

I recently bought a Sage Bambino and was super pumped to start making flat whites at home, but I’ve quickly realized I’m not great at it. My main issue is that the coffee comes out lukewarm, and my milk texture is just… bad.

I’m still a total beginner, so I know I’m probably making a bunch of rookie mistakes. The milk feels hot to the touch when I steam it, but I’m guessing it’s not hot enough? Also, I can’t seem to get that silky, smooth microfoam texture that makes flat whites so good.

I’d love any advice you can give me on:

* How to tell if my milk is the right temperature?
* Getting that perfect microfoam (I don’t even know if I’m frothing right!)
* Making sure my espresso shot isn’t part of the problem (because it might be…)

While it used to be easy to eat, drink and have fun on a tight budget, it's a lot tougher now. But there are ways to save money.

Seach ""Las Vegas Happy Hours."" If you're willing to eat on off-hours, you can get some great deals at fabulous restaurants. Every month, there's a ""Las Vegas Cheap Eats"" list that makes the rounds on social media. You can also see Las Vegas Facebook groups for tips. MGM also has a slot phone game. You dont have to pay any money, and it's not real gambling, but as long as you're using the game, you can earn points for restaurant coupons, free rooms, shows, etc. Ive used it many times and it's legit.

Hotels on the Strip are not cheap. If you join a players club for MGM or Caesars,  you can get preferred rates. Use these cards for, shopping, dining and gambling at their respective resorts to earn points for future trips. Also, don't forget that all hotels on the Strip (except Casino Royale, i think?) Charge resort fees. Which is about $50 per night, ON TOP of your rate! Note that when booking your hotel. Also, its rare for Strip hotels to have fridges and microwaves. You can rent fridges at some places, but at others, based on availability, they can give you a small medicine fridge if you need it. 

If you do not want to pay for them, DO NOT TOUCH THE MINIBAR ITEMS. The things in the fridge, and the dry goods are all on sensors, and you will get charged if you move them!

Transportation. During busy times, the ride share pickup at LAS gets really congested.  However, I've never waited longer than 5 minutes at the taxi queue. There are posted flat rates from the airport to different areas on the Strip and often, they're quicker and cheaper than Uber/Lyft.

Not really a budget tip, but everything is further than it seems, but it's flat and extremely walkable if you're able. You can skip the taxi and rideshares on the Strip by taking one of several monorails (some are free). There is a paid one that runs along the back of some properties.  It goes from MGM Grand northward, and there is a stop at Westgate (the Wrestlecon location).

And the obvious—only gamble what you're comfortable losing. I always bring ""gambling cash"" with me. When it's gone, it's gone. If I manage to bring any back home with me, even better!

That's all I can think of for now. But I'd love to see if others have any cost-saving tips. Or if there are any questions about the city/The Strip, we can answer them.

Aww.. they lost power and had no way to make any coffee but the drive through at Starbucks was open. 

Is there house still standing? Yes. Was their house flooded? No. Was their car damaged by the storm? No.

What they don’t see is just how lucky they are.They have a home, and a vehicle. And probably soon, they will have power. 

But, what is amazing is that these lifetime Floridians were not able to have a few supplies on hand to make it until they were able to get power. 

They whined that the house was so dark. Um.. don’t you have candles for a storm and loss  of electricity?? What about flashlights? A storm radio?? Then you would know if you have to boil water or not.

Why didn’t you have canned food ( ravioli etc) or whatever you like stashed away? Canned tuna? Canned vegetables? 

What about a camp stove since your grill is gone? They have had years of training to be prepared for a hurricane. Years! 

But, no. Mrs Grifter in Noble is now begging   her viewers to PAYPAL her cash to help her family through this difficult time. 

She was getting super chats but the cunning manipulator stated that she won’t see that cash until Thanksgiving when they get a payout from YouTube.

Her blind viewers were quick to send cash but we will never know how much, because transparency is not in her vocabulary. 

Koren’s Collectibles must feel so good about herself, sending super chats, cat food for the strays, and allergy meds for awkward Aaron. 

Pamela Blanchard is also blind to the grift. She was so quick to add in the PayPal address in the chat to help her grifty friend Ms get that free money. 
 Miss Pam is too nice and will continue to be taken advantage of. 


Were there grifting for a generator? Yes. Were they grifting for allergy meds? Yes 
Were the grifting for cash? Yes
Were they grifting for Sheba cat food? Yes, and Val the pharmacist was happy to oblige. 

Awkward Aaron is not camera material, if he is not holding a cat, he’s has the deer in the headlights look. 

But awkward Aaron was happy to call out a certain YouTuber, the cult of vintage. Apparently Cult Of Vintage struck a nerve when he blasted Chapter Two and their Amazon family wish list. He referred to Cult of Vintage as a douche. And that cult of vintage can say that because he had a sugar daddy. 

Aww, poor Awkward Aaron, now he has to buy his own white t-shirts. 

 If you watched the live, you will notice at the start Mrs Grift on Noble was very tense and worried. ( worried if people would give them free money after she spared her lies) and at the end of the video, Mrs Grift on Noble was relaxed and almost happy. She again manipulated her blind viewers to support her family because her and her awkward husband simply cannot do it. 


I wonder if Awkard Aaron’s mom is aware of his begging and grifting? Is she proud of him? 🤔

I'm 22M (Autistic and not the greatest looker) I've always had issues connecting with people but when *Spring(19F) came along, i thought my life was finally full. I spent years searching for someone and we clicked so fast so easily that the first date still feels like we already knew eachother. Moving onto the worst mistake I've ever made so far. *August 2024*
I (22m) was minutes away from leaving for my annual hunting trip with family. I'd been getting suspicions that the lady who i love had been losing interest the last month. I hangout before leaving to eavesdrop on a conversation. Shes talking about friends with benefits and not sucking dick. Already I'm broken, lost and in turn I yelled at her to move out of my house. She claimed it was her friend from vrchat and that it was normal for them to talk like that. Next couple months roll by and im broken and lost inside. I've been trying everything to get the love of my life back, I keep screwing it up by saying something so fucking stupid that she ended up blocking me on everything but fb. I created a new dating profile to find somebody and end up finding hers. Confronted her and asked to get back together. ""Maybe, I still have feelings for you and it's not because I'm looking for a relationship"" FUCK I messed up so bad she's just looking for s*x. Another month rolls around *October* I'm still broken, I'm taking time off work to get through my thoughts, I've been talking to my cousins sister in law. (We've been on and off for months b4 spring the ex-gf of 1.6yr) tonight was Lauren's 20th birthday  and she invited me out for drinks after a week of talking and cuddling. After the drinks I managed to convince *Spring* for coffee on the following Sunday. I fucked up big the first time with Spring and im so scared to lose her. Am I supposed to make amends and live my new life on without her *spring* or do I leave this potential new women out and run back to her and hide from all the hatred, sadness and more.
I'm scared, confused and lost. I love Spring so much that I don't want to accept losing her but should I move on?

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

1g1zl0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1g1zl0m/what_snapping_fingers_can_teach_you_about_your/,What Snapping Fingers Can Teach You About Your Smoking Habit,"Imagine for a moment that, for the past 20 years, every time you had a cup of coffee, felt stressed, relaxed, or even after every meal, you snapped your fingers. Over time, snapping your fingers became second nature. You did it without even thinking—whether you were happy, sad, or just bored. It became part of your routine, linked to so many daily activities.

Now imagine one day, you just stopped snapping your fingers. The coffee would still taste the same, your stress would still come and go, but something would feel... **off**. You’d notice your hands feeling idle, like something’s missing. But here’s the thing: snapping your fingers never actually did anything. It was just a habit—an association your brain made with all those activities. And now, without it, your brain feels a little confused.

This is exactly how smoking works. You don’t smoke because your body needs it in those moments. You smoke because your brain has taught itself that cigarettes go hand in hand with your coffee, your breaks, and even your relaxation. But just like snapping your fingers, smoking doesn’t change the actual experience—you’ve simply trained yourself to think it’s part of the routine.

Here’s the good news: breaking that association is entirely possible. Just like how you could stop snapping your fingers, you can stop smoking without it affecting your life the way you think it will. **It’ll feel strange at first**, but after a little time, you’ll realize it wasn’t the cigarette you needed—**it was just a trick your brain played on you.**

I’m finding through more than one machine(Jura, DeLonghi) that I seem to be going through filters at an accelerated rate. I returned the 2 delonghi because the filter lasted 3 weeks. And the Jura just told me that I needed to replace the filter and upon further reflection it’s a 50liter filter. 

This machine is for a house of 3.

7 cups of coffee between us, 365ish days a year is the rule. This is 2555. Add a couple hundred to be safe for holidays, guests, and the occasional mid day coffee/affogato, and or an extra morning cup. And now I’m at 2855 cups of coffee a year minimally. Do I need to be looking at more of a commercial/high end machine. Based on this it seems instead of Keurig being unreliable(which it is anyway) I may actually be killing the coffee maker due to use. Is my train of thought a sound one?

What super automatic coffee machines would you all recommend? While I preferred the Delonghi D+ coffee over the Jura S8. They both brewed significantly better cups than the Keurig. We drink only black coffee and an espresso for the affogato. I do not want a traditional carafe machine because 2 of the 3 do not want to deal with waiting for the machine to brew more coffee. I’m not really into it either, and the best one won’t fit under the cabinet. 

Budget: I’m interested in finding out what the Budget, mid, high, premium. That being said, I originally wanted to stay around $1000-$2000(absolutely top) I’m finding I may have to go a little higher and I’d like to know what’s out there for this use case.

I go to the kitchen, trying to grab something to drink while making mental notes of what to do before my mother wakes up: Work out, give the cat her medicine, do my important prep work for next week before I get unmotivated, then breakfast...

... as I walk back with the cat's medicine, my mother's door rips open. Everything immediately falls apart. She instantly talks to me about her weird dreams and whatnot, I don't dare workout with her hovering around me. I put the medicine down as she then proceeds to offer a plate of food to the cat and that doesn't really mesh well. Then she takes up my desk to surf the internet. I abort and grab my clothes to change outside my room. As I do so, she barges around me to get a cup of coffee, also blocking the kitchen for me that way. I flee to the bathroom and lock myself in, briefly sinking to my knees and dramatically silent-screaming at the ceiling.  
After recovering myself a bit (and now being out of my pajamas), I went to get breakfast. As I open the fridge a tupperware box my mother lodged in sideways at a precarious position gets launched at me at high speed. Since I fail to catch it and it clatters on the ground, I let out a desperate cry-sigh. My mother jumps up and walks over, I desperately say that it's nothing and she complains about me having such a bad mood for no reason.  
So I make myself breakfast, do the dishes, water the plants, start with some of my work I don't need the computer for, all to pass the time until my mother is finished at the desk. Then move back in and... all motivation is sapped. In the last four hours I actually managed to finish half of what I wanted to do... but at a snail's pace, constantly interrupting myself as she shoves more plates under the nose of the cat (when she is particularly anxious about it not eating enough, she does that up to 12 times a day) or remembers things she wanted to tell me, with me ending up in a loop of anxiety and procrastination.

And... that is literally every single weekend. Or at least some variation of it. With me starting the work week exhausted and glad I'm back at work, having to catch up on the tasks that I wasn't able to do at home because of my constant state of anxiety and stretching out all tasks across the entire weekend. Resentment is a fucking poison. I hate her. I don't want to be around her anymore. And yet I still am where I am, being used as her retirement plan, because I'm too fucking scared of her reactions to me disagreeing with any of this. I hate this. So, so much... Why is my life like this? I feel so absurdly isolated and lonely. I fantasize about healthy relationships all the time.

I prefer lighter roasts, and they have quite a varied selection I’ve wanted to try.

***Employment:

Here's the deal, we are felons now. Employment will be a challenge, but it's not impossible. You're not too good for any job. Work at McDonald's, work at UPS, go work at that manufacturing plant down the street. Felons are capable of very successful careers in law, psychology/counseling, the trades, etc, but you need to hold a job for a while with no issues. Show up to work, don't call out. Work any job you can until you get one you enjoy. You may have to work multiple jobs, but that's ok. 

Some community colleges offer trade education If the adademic educational route isn't for you. 
*State unemployment agencies sometimes have resources for felons. 

Also, get a hobby. 
Indoor rock climbing/bouldering, golf, skydiving (indoor/outdoor), aerial arts (silks, Lyra, etc), running, biking, rugby, wrestling, boxing, etc. Literally, get a damn hobby. Make new friends and associate with people who aren't choosing to be career criminals. You will feel better, and stay out of trouble. 

Last few things, apply for benefits. You need SNAP/EBT? Cool, apply for it and feed your kids. Don't make it a long term thing. Don't let anyone make you feel like crap for using it. Go to work, get you and the kids some food, and better yourself. Most states require you to work to receive benefits anyways, so don't let anyone tear you apart. 

Also, get a therapist. You may not think you need one, but you do. You have a record. Go to through your county agency and get one. They can get you linked up with psych as well to get medication. You may not think you need these services, but most people who commit crimes have an underlying mental health issue. Get help. Nobody in your life has to know you go to therapy and have a psychiatrist. Take care of you. 

You want to go out and rob the store down the street for smokes when the sun goes down? Nah dude, stay home and watch netflix or prime. There's so many good shows and movies there. You can even get Tubi and Pluto, because those are free. Sit your ass down and binge watch a show instead of binging on crime.

1g1z9b8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1g1z9b8/how_should_i_handle_this_friend_situation/,How should I handle this friend situation?,"I got married two weeks ago (it was a wonderful day, so beautiful!) and had 6 bridesmaids and 3 maids of honor. For my maids of honor I ends up picking 3 because they each mean so much to me  and each represent a different phase of my life. Two of them, let’s call them Taylor and Anne, I have known since I was in 7th and 8th grade. We’ve literally seen each other through all phases of life (we’re all almost 30 now). I even lived with Taylor in my early 20s. My third maid of honor, we will call her Ella, is my newest friend of my bridal party (the other bridesmaids were childhood friends or college friends). I met her at 23 and we’ve been friends since and have gotten quite close. I really find her friendship to be extra special because it was made in adulthood which is near/ rare (I also feel extremely grateful to have rich friendships with my childhood friends). 
While prepping for my wedding Ella, Taylor and Anne met up at a coffee shop once a week in the weeks leading up to the wedding and had so much fun doing it they decided to continue it post wedding. I was excited about that. I’ve always enjoyed mixing my world, especially my friend groups. 
Ella has a lot of experience in the medical world, and I have been having some serious health stuff… I need to go get screened for liver and uterus cancer… I’m very anxious about it.  
Today I texted Ella asking if I could talk to her about my medical stuff (mostly looking for advice about how to get seen by a doctor faster, they won’t see me for a month and a half and I’m scared). So Ella called me. 
She starts the call by asking me if she can list everything she did that day so I can tell her she’s been so productive. I was really hoping to talk about my medical stuff but was feeling very emotional as I prepared to bring it up so I said yes so I could have a moment to center myself and try not to cry when talking about my medical stuff, again I’m really scared. 
While she’s telling me what she did she mentions that my friends Taylor, Anne and her got coffee again today and was telling me what happened, I said that sounded fun and I’d love to join next time. She got really quiet and goes tells me that she doesn’t think she wants me there. I was really taken a back and confused. I asked why and she said because she’s trying to form her own independent friendships with them… I told her I love that and support that but was confused as to why my presence would detract from that. She paused and then said she would have to ask the other two. I was so confused and shocked. These are two women I’ve known since childhood, I’ve never had this kind of situation with them until now, and until Ella. I started crying and excused myself from the conversation. I didn’t want to tell her I’m afraid I have cancer and be so vulnerable medically with her right after she talked to me like that and said that to me. 
Following this conversation I filled Anne and Taylor in on the situation since I felt they had a right to know since they were brought up and because they’re my friends and I process with them. They both assured me that they do not feel the same way, in fact Anne is pretty pissed that she would be dragged into it. 
I feel confused and upset and not sure how to proceed. Is it crazy to sort of feel like Ella is excluding me on purpose and sort of trying to steal my fiends? I know she’s very insecure about not having many friends where we live and that she’s my “newest” friend. 
She did text me this apology later

I was cagey and not direct, which was not nice. It sucks when people do that. I am feeling excited about my new friendships with Anne and Taylor and got protective, and that wasn’t cool. I apologize.

 but even that I felt was half asses and also didn’t even touch on the fact that she only talked about herself and then basically mean girl said “you can’t sit with us” when I called to talk to her about me needing to get tested for cancer (also she was the first person I went to talk about it, even before I told my husband what I’m worried about). 

How should I proceed? This is the text I sent in response:

So I've been using the 64mm ls v2 silver knight burrs for a few months now with a gaggia classic pro.
They have produced a wonderful cup of pour over with a wonderful sweet taste at the end. It's been a superb filter burr.

However, I've really struggled to pull espresso consistently out of them. A shot goes from gushing to choking sometimes without any adjustment.
When I bought them from MiiCoffee back in Dec 2023, I was under the impression that they were suited for multiple brewing method, including  espresso. I originally opted for these because the filter coffee out of the dlc burrs was pretty bad.

Anyway, here I am going back to the DLC burrs because I want the convenience of an electric espresso grinder again, and the v2 burrs just didn't cut it for me.

Has anyone had a similar experience? I want a burr that can kind of do both filter and espresso well. I know that the common wisdom is to have separate grinders for different methods, and while I do see the wisdom in this, I don't have the space (I have a regular J grinder for pour over).

1g1z7wk,https://www.reddit.com/r/RugbyWorldCup/comments/1g1z7wk/were_pale_male_and_stale_that_wont_do_much_in_2024/,"‘We’re pale, male and stale. That won’t do much in 2024’","**From The Telegraph:**

Somehow, in the midst of a supposed crisis of masculinity, three men have created a veritable behemoth of blokeishness. ‘Society needs people like us,’ declares [James Haskell](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/james-haskell/), self-styled ‘Archbishop of Banterbury’ and one third of *The Good, the Bad & the Rugby*, a chart-topping podcast that revels in its skewering of today’s hair-trigger sensibilities. ‘Being strong, masculine, protective, loud, dominant: men like us play a role, you can’t deny it. I’m unapologetic about it now. I’m here, and I’m not going anywhere.’

Haskell is the type of person you can hear long before he even enters a room. Brash, strident, often wilfully provocative, he handles most subjects in the same way he dealt with opponents in his 77 appearances as an England flanker, flattening anything in his path without heed for the consequences. His two sidekicks in the studio live in perpetual terror about what he will say next. 

‘If you work with him,’ says Alex Payne, a clean-cut former Sky host who glues the operation together, ‘you’re never quite sure which one’s going to be the last show. It could be any week.’

The final member of the trio, [Mike Tindall](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/mike-tindall/), holds twin distinctions as a Rugby World Cup winner and the husband to the 21st in line to the throne – he too says it is futile trying to curb Haskell’s excesses. ‘I can’t,’ he smiles, wearily. ‘He has to live his life.’ 

They make a motley crew, all told: where Tindall plays the straight man to Haskell’s court jester, sighing at certain anecdotes, Payne brings the polished production values that have helped turn 90 minutes of weekly whimsy into a phenomenon, recorded everywhere from The London Palladium to [Windsor Castle](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/windsor-castle/).

We meet at Canterbury Court, a converted Kennington warehouse beside the Oval, decked out with burnt-orange sofas and trendily exposed pipework, where they are preparing to launch the podcast’s fifth series. They constitute a brand these days, with their disciples able to buy GBR hoodies and corporate clients hiring them for clay-pigeon shoots and Ibiza cruises. Now, perhaps most surprisingly, they have written a book.

According to the subtitle, this is their ‘unleashed’ version. But after 299 episodes, myriad legal cases, and a seemingly insatiable lust for controversy, do they have anything still to unleash? For Haskell, the answer is an emphatic yes. 

‘I jumped at the chance. I was always keen to tell a journey about where we came from, some of the darker times. We’re men, we’re parents, and we’ve all gone through all sorts of issues. Many of those experiences – separation, retirement, the births of our children – have been played out in the media glare. So it was important to describe them unashamedly and honestly.’

‘We are three pale, male and stale blokes,’ Payne adds. ‘Which, in 2024, isn’t doing very much for anybody. But we’re keen to do what we want to do. If people want to come along for the ride, great.’

‘If you don’t want to like us, you won’t like us,’ says Haskell Hamish Brown

Rugby’s podcast market is a saturated one, but their unreconstructed alpha-maleness is critical to their appeal – along with their fearlessness at covering subjects others won’t touch, like the debate around [biological males competing in women’s sport](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/04/30/womens-sports-die-unless-trans-competitors-excluded/). 

In the book, Haskell tackles the subject head on: ‘Whether you think trans women are actually women is kind of irrelevant, the fact is they have biological advantages, which makes them competing in women’s sport completely unfair. 

‘I know science is a dirty word these days as feelings are more important than facts. Imagine what would happen if I changed sex, took T-blockers, got some boobs and took up a combat sport against women. It would not be fair or end well.’ 

But the podcast has also hosted some regal guests. Courtesy of Tindall, they secured a 50-minute fireside chat at Windsor with [Princess Anne and the Prince and Princess of Wales](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/09/09/prince-princess-wales-william-rugby-world-cup-competitive/). Negotiations were hardly fraught: Tindall, who has three children with [Zara Phillips](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/zara-tindall/), simply asked his mother-in-law. 

He enjoys a good relationship with the family. As he writes in the book: ‘Believe it or not, marrying into the Royal family was pretty easy for me. They were always nice to me, and I was always nice to them. Simple really.’

Still, the delicate protocols were almost upended when Haskell introduced himself to William ahead of recording with the words: ‘All right Boss.’ 

Haskell also admits to being disappointed by the reality of life in a royal castle. ‘I expected big trays loaded with scones and exotic fruit tarts. Instead, I got a couple of broken rich teas and what appeared to be a half-eaten malted milk – a leftover from a box of Family Circle biscuits… Luckily, I’d brought along an M&S sandwich, but when I started eating it, someone appeared and shooed me into a corridor. They’d been on red alert since our MD spilt coffee on what was probably a priceless Chippendale cabinet.’

But the sheer incongruity of the set-up, with three rugby obsessives sitting opposite three of the most senior royals, brought a portrayal that was genuinely refreshing. One comment by William and Catherine – that they had never finished a tennis match against each other because they were too competitive – made headlines. Such an insight was revelatory to everyone besides Tindall. 

‘It just came from seeing them in their most relaxed environment,’ he explains. ‘These are the conversations we have when we’re just talking to each other anyway. With Princess Anne, it’s the conversation we have about rugby at Gloucester, or about Scotland after every Six Nations game. A lot of the time, it will be about a player. She’ll say to me, “Should he not be doing this more?” And I’ll think, “You’re actually not that far off.” We were asking the same questions I had asked them before, but this time they were giving the answers to the public, rather than just to me.’

Some of the ribaldry inevitably ended up on the cutting-room floor. When William discovered that his inquisitors would be spending most of last year’s World Cup entertaining on a ship docked in Marseille, he asked Haskell: ‘What on earth are you doing that for? Are you going to be the anchor?’ ‘Well, it sounds a bit like anchor,’  Haskell replied. ‘Yes,’ Anne interjected, wryly, ‘I see that.’ Payne still wishes that the comment could have made the final cut. ‘It would have been an absolute sensation.’

Haskell was left impressed. ‘Princess Anne knew more about sport than almost anyone I’ve ever met,’ he writes in the book. 

As for other members of the family, Tindall’s bond with [Prince George](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/prince-george/) is particularly close: ‘George loves his football. I’ve played numerous times in the garden with him. He’s passionate about Aston Villa, too. Wherever he is, he’ll sit down and watch that game. They’re just a family who love sport. Catherine loves her running.’

But the episode also served as a reminder of the line that Tindall has to tread. On the one hand, he is the face of a highly irreverent podcast, with listeners desperate for juicy royal anecdotes. On the other, he is duty-bound to keep the confidences of the most scrutinised family in the world.

It is a tension, you sense, that Haskell loves to exploit. ‘Some say to me, “Can you ask Mike if they’re part of the Illuminati? Are any of them real lizard people?”’ On the road, he has been known to embarrass his co-host by cracking jokes about [Prince Andrew](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/can-overdose-adrenaline-really-stop-sweating-like-prince-andrew/) ‘sweating up a storm on the dance floor’. Tindall weathers the bombardment with stoicism. ‘He’ll pick up on something that I say,’ he laments. ‘And then, if you look at the cesspool of Instagram, I get dragged into it.’

Haskell takes a pointed swipe in the book at Omid Scobie, obsequious chronicler of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, calling him a ‘very odd bloke’. ‘Royal fans can be mental,’ Haskell adds. ‘We all know that American royal fans are f—king nuts, especially Scobieites.’

Scobie fuelled a pile-on against Tindall when, in 2022, he criticised the former England centre for ‘cashing in’ on his royal connections by appearing on *I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here!*. ‘I don’t even have access to my Twitter,’  says Tindall today. ‘I just \[get\] tagged in by anyone who’s talking about anything. It’s so random, what I have to sift through. 

‘If there’s any story about me or my kids, it will get entangled into a web of something else, and I’m tagged into reading all this crap. That’s the world we live in. Some have got nothing better to do than bag people.’

Haskell has his own experience of being part of a famous family. Last October he separated from [Chloe Madeley](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/chloe-madeley-learned-health-2020/), daughter of former daytime TV fixtures Richard and Judy, after five years of marriage. Tindall knew her, having appeared together on Channel 4 series, *The Jump*. ‘She’s basically a female version of Hask,’ Tindall writes, ‘which made for an interesting relationship.’

Haskell learnt quickly about the perils of attracting the paparazzi. One evening, after a performance at the Palladium with his two confrères, he was pictured in close proximity to a woman who was not his wife, sparking the headline: ‘Haskell and mystery blonde’. The lady in question was Payne’s sister.

‘It was the most extraordinary example of how the whole system works,’ Payne says. ‘We were actually underneath a sign showing us as *The Good, the Bad & the Rugby.* I had my elbow in the picture that was used. 

‘When I was still at home, it was a case of, “Oh, it’s another woman”,’ Haskell reflects, ruefully. ‘I had to say, “Look, I’m not with any of these people.” I’ve become hyper-aware as a result. I’m quite loud, and I see people trying to take photos. A guy walked into a restaurant the other day, pretending to look around, but he was filming me with my daughter. At London Zoo, I had to stop two women from doing it. It does make life difficult sometimes.’

Then there was the time when, during a lockdown in 2021, he got into a spat with a man after Haskell [took his Labrador, Bertie, off the lead](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2021/11/03/james-haskell-interview-scary-terms-cancel-culture-going-get/) near his Northampton home, in an area where two sheep had recently been attacked. The exchange reached *Farmers Guardian*. 

‘People were threatening to shoot me, shoot my dog, offering me out for a fight,’ he recalls. ‘Basically they were going to plough me into a field if they saw me. Again it all came from something taken out of context, sensationalised. But by alienating farmers, I lost Chloe a sponsorship deal. She wasn’t overly pleased.’

So unfailingly does he attract controversy that a chapter in the book is titled ‘Upsetting Women’. In one incident, they were listing England’s most-capped male forwards during an episode of the podcast and a female player highlighted how World Cup winner Rochelle ‘Rocky’ Clark had more caps than any of them. ‘Do better,’ she wrote. ‘Please stop disrespecting women’s rugby.’ ‘Have a day off,’ Haskell fired back. ‘We have done more to champion women’s rugby than anyone else... Pick your battles and try to be positive.’ Cue mayhem, with Haskell accused by many women in the sport of symbolising an out-of-touch patriarchy, and a GBR sponsor ordering him to apologise. He is still sore about it: ‘I was forced to do it, which is the antithesis of everything I stand for. It was a politician’s apology.’

Payne winces slightly at the memory. As the most outwardly buttoned-up of the three – ‘He probably gets around by penny farthing,’ taunts Haskell – he is less inclined towards confrontation. But he rushes to defend the honour of his co-presenters whenever they stray. 

It was only when he saw himself decried as an ‘insufferable snob’ in a message on YouTube that Payne bit too. Clicking through to the person’s bio, he discovered that he was a wedding photographer and found his mobile number on his website. ‘I couldn’t resist phoning him, and he made the mistake of picking up,’ he recalls. ‘He tried to argue his way out of it, but after about 15 seconds he said, “D’you know what, Alex? I’m so sorry. I’ve been at home on my own for three weeks and I’m feeling very lonely. I don’t know why I said what I did, it’s not me and I feel really embarrassed.”’

For Payne, it was a salutary lesson. ‘It just reminds you that those shouting abuse at you often have their own issues to deal with.’

And yet they’ve no plans to dial down the machismo. Tindall, in particular, regards it as an immutable element of his personality, with his perspective on the issue sharpened now he has a three-year-old son, Lucas, after daughters Mia and Lena. Hours before the interview begins, Lucas has appeared in newspapers [taking karate kicks at Lena](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/09/07/mike-tindall-breaks-up-play-fight-children/) during a day out at Burghley Horse Trials. ‘You can’t stop him,’ Tindall grins.

‘He wants physical contact. He wants to be wrestled. He imagines himself as a ninja, and he just walks around with sticks whacking people. He’s such a typical boy, you almost have to run him into the ground with exercise, like a dog, otherwise he won’t sleep. You’re built that way. So, being fully masculine, which a lot of rugby players are, is not a bad thing.’

But he is also conscious that this idea of men congratulating each other on how manly they are will not be to everybody’s taste. ‘Guys want camaraderie,’ he shrugs. ‘And sometimes that comes out in the wrong way.’

  
‘If you don’t want to like us, you won’t like us,’ Haskell chips in. ‘And that’s fine.’ 

But with three million listeners tuning in and counting, it’s clear who is winning that battle.

1g1z7m1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BRF/comments/1g1z7m1/mike_tindall_james_haskell_and_alex_payne_were/,"Mike Tindall, James Haskell and Alex Payne: ‘We’re pale, male and stale. That won’t do much in 2024’","**From The Telegraph:**

Somehow, in the midst of a supposed crisis of masculinity, three men have created a veritable behemoth of blokeishness. ‘Society needs people like us,’ declares [James Haskell](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/james-haskell/), self-styled ‘Archbishop of Banterbury’ and one third of *The Good, the Bad & the Rugby*, a chart-topping podcast that revels in its skewering of today’s hair-trigger sensibilities. ‘Being strong, masculine, protective, loud, dominant: men like us play a role, you can’t deny it. I’m unapologetic about it now. I’m here, and I’m not going anywhere.’

Haskell is the type of person you can hear long before he even enters a room. Brash, strident, often wilfully provocative, he handles most subjects in the same way he dealt with opponents in his 77 appearances as an England flanker, flattening anything in his path without heed for the consequences. His two sidekicks in the studio live in perpetual terror about what he will say next. 

‘If you work with him,’ says Alex Payne, a clean-cut former Sky host who glues the operation together, ‘you’re never quite sure which one’s going to be the last show. It could be any week.’

The final member of the trio, [Mike Tindall](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/mike-tindall/), holds twin distinctions as a Rugby World Cup winner and the husband to the 21st in line to the throne – he too says it is futile trying to curb Haskell’s excesses. ‘I can’t,’ he smiles, wearily. ‘He has to live his life.’ 

They make a motley crew, all told: where Tindall plays the straight man to Haskell’s court jester, sighing at certain anecdotes, Payne brings the polished production values that have helped turn 90 minutes of weekly whimsy into a phenomenon, recorded everywhere from The London Palladium to [Windsor Castle](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/windsor-castle/).

We meet at Canterbury Court, a converted Kennington warehouse beside the Oval, decked out with burnt-orange sofas and trendily exposed pipework, where they are preparing to launch the podcast’s fifth series. They constitute a brand these days, with their disciples able to buy GBR hoodies and corporate clients hiring them for clay-pigeon shoots and Ibiza cruises. Now, perhaps most surprisingly, they have written a book.

According to the subtitle, this is their ‘unleashed’ version. But after 299 episodes, myriad legal cases, and a seemingly insatiable lust for controversy, do they have anything still to unleash? For Haskell, the answer is an emphatic yes. 

‘I jumped at the chance. I was always keen to tell a journey about where we came from, some of the darker times. We’re men, we’re parents, and we’ve all gone through all sorts of issues. Many of those experiences – separation, retirement, the births of our children – have been played out in the media glare. So it was important to describe them unashamedly and honestly.’

‘We are three pale, male and stale blokes,’ Payne adds. ‘Which, in 2024, isn’t doing very much for anybody. But we’re keen to do what we want to do. If people want to come along for the ride, great.’

‘If you don’t want to like us, you won’t like us,’ says Haskell Hamish Brown

Rugby’s podcast market is a saturated one, but their unreconstructed alpha-maleness is critical to their appeal – along with their fearlessness at covering subjects others won’t touch, like the debate around [biological males competing in women’s sport](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/04/30/womens-sports-die-unless-trans-competitors-excluded/). 

In the book, Haskell tackles the subject head on: ‘Whether you think trans women are actually women is kind of irrelevant, the fact is they have biological advantages, which makes them competing in women’s sport completely unfair. 

‘I know science is a dirty word these days as feelings are more important than facts. Imagine what would happen if I changed sex, took T-blockers, got some boobs and took up a combat sport against women. It would not be fair or end well.’ 

But the podcast has also hosted some regal guests. Courtesy of Tindall, they secured a 50-minute fireside chat at Windsor with [Princess Anne and the Prince and Princess of Wales](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/09/09/prince-princess-wales-william-rugby-world-cup-competitive/). Negotiations were hardly fraught: Tindall, who has three children with [Zara Phillips](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/zara-tindall/), simply asked his mother-in-law. 

He enjoys a good relationship with the family. As he writes in the book: ‘Believe it or not, marrying into the Royal family was pretty easy for me. They were always nice to me, and I was always nice to them. Simple really.’

Still, the delicate protocols were almost upended when Haskell introduced himself to William ahead of recording with the words: ‘All right Boss.’ 

Haskell also admits to being disappointed by the reality of life in a royal castle. ‘I expected big trays loaded with scones and exotic fruit tarts. Instead, I got a couple of broken rich teas and what appeared to be a half-eaten malted milk – a leftover from a box of Family Circle biscuits… Luckily, I’d brought along an M&S sandwich, but when I started eating it, someone appeared and shooed me into a corridor. They’d been on red alert since our MD spilt coffee on what was probably a priceless Chippendale cabinet.’

But the sheer incongruity of the set-up, with three rugby obsessives sitting opposite three of the most senior royals, brought a portrayal that was genuinely refreshing. One comment by William and Catherine – that they had never finished a tennis match against each other because they were too competitive – made headlines. Such an insight was revelatory to everyone besides Tindall. 

‘It just came from seeing them in their most relaxed environment,’ he explains. ‘These are the conversations we have when we’re just talking to each other anyway. With Princess Anne, it’s the conversation we have about rugby at Gloucester, or about Scotland after every Six Nations game. A lot of the time, it will be about a player. She’ll say to me, “Should he not be doing this more?” And I’ll think, “You’re actually not that far off.” We were asking the same questions I had asked them before, but this time they were giving the answers to the public, rather than just to me.’

Some of the ribaldry inevitably ended up on the cutting-room floor. When William discovered that his inquisitors would be spending most of last year’s World Cup entertaining on a ship docked in Marseille, he asked Haskell: ‘What on earth are you doing that for? Are you going to be the anchor?’ ‘Well, it sounds a bit like anchor,’  Haskell replied. ‘Yes,’ Anne interjected, wryly, ‘I see that.’ Payne still wishes that the comment could have made the final cut. ‘It would have been an absolute sensation.’

Haskell was left impressed. ‘Princess Anne knew more about sport than almost anyone I’ve ever met,’ he writes in the book. 

As for other members of the family, Tindall’s bond with [Prince George](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/prince-george/) is particularly close: ‘George loves his football. I’ve played numerous times in the garden with him. He’s passionate about Aston Villa, too. Wherever he is, he’ll sit down and watch that game. They’re just a family who love sport. Catherine loves her running.’

But the episode also served as a reminder of the line that Tindall has to tread. On the one hand, he is the face of a highly irreverent podcast, with listeners desperate for juicy royal anecdotes. On the other, he is duty-bound to keep the confidences of the most scrutinised family in the world.

It is a tension, you sense, that Haskell loves to exploit. ‘Some say to me, “Can you ask Mike if they’re part of the Illuminati? Are any of them real lizard people?”’ On the road, he has been known to embarrass his co-host by cracking jokes about [Prince Andrew](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/can-overdose-adrenaline-really-stop-sweating-like-prince-andrew/) ‘sweating up a storm on the dance floor’. Tindall weathers the bombardment with stoicism. ‘He’ll pick up on something that I say,’ he laments. ‘And then, if you look at the cesspool of Instagram, I get dragged into it.’

Haskell takes a pointed swipe in the book at Omid Scobie, obsequious chronicler of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, calling him a ‘very odd bloke’. ‘Royal fans can be mental,’ Haskell adds. ‘We all know that American royal fans are f—king nuts, especially Scobieites.’

Scobie fuelled a pile-on against Tindall when, in 2022, he criticised the former England centre for ‘cashing in’ on his royal connections by appearing on *I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here!*. ‘I don’t even have access to my Twitter,’  says Tindall today. ‘I just \[get\] tagged in by anyone who’s talking about anything. It’s so random, what I have to sift through. 

‘If there’s any story about me or my kids, it will get entangled into a web of something else, and I’m tagged into reading all this crap. That’s the world we live in. Some have got nothing better to do than bag people.’

Haskell has his own experience of being part of a famous family. Last October he separated from [Chloe Madeley](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/chloe-madeley-learned-health-2020/), daughter of former daytime TV fixtures Richard and Judy, after five years of marriage. Tindall knew her, having appeared together on Channel 4 series, *The Jump*. ‘She’s basically a female version of Hask,’ Tindall writes, ‘which made for an interesting relationship.’

Haskell learnt quickly about the perils of attracting the paparazzi. One evening, after a performance at the Palladium with his two confrères, he was pictured in close proximity to a woman who was not his wife, sparking the headline: ‘Haskell and mystery blonde’. The lady in question was Payne’s sister.

‘It was the most extraordinary example of how the whole system works,’ Payne says. ‘We were actually underneath a sign showing us as *The Good, the Bad & the Rugby.* I had my elbow in the picture that was used. 

‘When I was still at home, it was a case of, “Oh, it’s another woman”,’ Haskell reflects, ruefully. ‘I had to say, “Look, I’m not with any of these people.” I’ve become hyper-aware as a result. I’m quite loud, and I see people trying to take photos. A guy walked into a restaurant the other day, pretending to look around, but he was filming me with my daughter. At London Zoo, I had to stop two women from doing it. It does make life difficult sometimes.’

Then there was the time when, during a lockdown in 2021, he got into a spat with a man after Haskell [took his Labrador, Bertie, off the lead](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2021/11/03/james-haskell-interview-scary-terms-cancel-culture-going-get/) near his Northampton home, in an area where two sheep had recently been attacked. The exchange reached *Farmers Guardian*. 

‘People were threatening to shoot me, shoot my dog, offering me out for a fight,’ he recalls. ‘Basically they were going to plough me into a field if they saw me. Again it all came from something taken out of context, sensationalised. But by alienating farmers, I lost Chloe a sponsorship deal. She wasn’t overly pleased.’

So unfailingly does he attract controversy that a chapter in the book is titled ‘Upsetting Women’. In one incident, they were listing England’s most-capped male forwards during an episode of the podcast and a female player highlighted how World Cup winner Rochelle ‘Rocky’ Clark had more caps than any of them. ‘Do better,’ she wrote. ‘Please stop disrespecting women’s rugby.’ ‘Have a day off,’ Haskell fired back. ‘We have done more to champion women’s rugby than anyone else... Pick your battles and try to be positive.’ Cue mayhem, with Haskell accused by many women in the sport of symbolising an out-of-touch patriarchy, and a GBR sponsor ordering him to apologise. He is still sore about it: ‘I was forced to do it, which is the antithesis of everything I stand for. It was a politician’s apology.’

Payne winces slightly at the memory. As the most outwardly buttoned-up of the three – ‘He probably gets around by penny farthing,’ taunts Haskell – he is less inclined towards confrontation. But he rushes to defend the honour of his co-presenters whenever they stray. 

It was only when he saw himself decried as an ‘insufferable snob’ in a message on YouTube that Payne bit too. Clicking through to the person’s bio, he discovered that he was a wedding photographer and found his mobile number on his website. ‘I couldn’t resist phoning him, and he made the mistake of picking up,’ he recalls. ‘He tried to argue his way out of it, but after about 15 seconds he said, “D’you know what, Alex? I’m so sorry. I’ve been at home on my own for three weeks and I’m feeling very lonely. I don’t know why I said what I did, it’s not me and I feel really embarrassed.”’

For Payne, it was a salutary lesson. ‘It just reminds you that those shouting abuse at you often have their own issues to deal with.’

And yet they’ve no plans to dial down the machismo. Tindall, in particular, regards it as an immutable element of his personality, with his perspective on the issue sharpened now he has a three-year-old son, Lucas, after daughters Mia and Lena. Hours before the interview begins, Lucas has appeared in newspapers [taking karate kicks at Lena](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/09/07/mike-tindall-breaks-up-play-fight-children/) during a day out at Burghley Horse Trials. ‘You can’t stop him,’ Tindall grins.

‘He wants physical contact. He wants to be wrestled. He imagines himself as a ninja, and he just walks around with sticks whacking people. He’s such a typical boy, you almost have to run him into the ground with exercise, like a dog, otherwise he won’t sleep. You’re built that way. So, being fully masculine, which a lot of rugby players are, is not a bad thing.’

But he is also conscious that this idea of men congratulating each other on how manly they are will not be to everybody’s taste. ‘Guys want camaraderie,’ he shrugs. ‘And sometimes that comes out in the wrong way.’

  
‘If you don’t want to like us, you won’t like us,’ Haskell chips in. ‘And that’s fine.’ 

But with three million listeners tuning in and counting, it’s clear who is winning that battle.

I had full auto stuff in the past and also just tried the Ninja Luxe machine which very much disappointed me. The milk wand was pretty shit for me and the lack of actually getting two espresso next to each other was a dealbreaker. 

Now im looking around what else i could buy. For me personally i want an espresso machine that is quick and easy to use. I want the option to try out stuff without the need to manually dial in on every bean i buy if i dont want to. Also because im often quite spontanious with my coffee i dont want more then like 2 min of heat up time. An all in one unit would be preferable especially because without it i dont think i would ever get to ease of use im looking for. I mainly drink latte or Cappuccino with an Espresso in the morning every now and then.

The only real options ive found come from sage. The barista touch impress and the oracle jet. Looking at the best possible offers i would probably go for the oracle just for the sake of it because there is only 350€ between them and even less if i go through sage directely. But tbh these machines are somehwat out of the price range i want to spend atm with the absolute maximum being 1000€.

I’ve gone out and bought ground coffee from a local guy who roasts his own small batch. He said to get the filter one. I might be wrong on that but anyway, I don’t have a grinder. 

Ignoring a grinder for now, I want to create a nice setup on my sideboard unit. 

What else - that is super useful - can I fill the space with? E.G, I don’t even know what a pour over is, but I’ve heard the phrase before, lol! 

If anyone can give me a couple of links to cool looking devices to fill my coffee area space, that would be so welcome! Thank you ☺️ ",1,1728735271.0,Moccamaster,2,1.0,False

And what do you actully eat? ,When I menstruate my digestive system changes completely. Sometimes I crave something really greasy that I know would make me sick but I end up eating a boiled potato or rice XD Oh and I'm really team salty but when I menstruate I want chocolate and ddl non-stop. Doesn't it happen to you that usual things like mate or coffee can make you sick on those days?,2,1728735201.0,menstruation,0,1.0,False

What do they mean by Figs, Dark Chocolate and Roasted Almond? Does it mean they add additional ingredients while roasting? Also can someone explain (or point to a guide) on the other parameters shown here? Thanks. ",5,1728735125.0,IndiaCoffee,4,0.86,False
1g1yquq,https://i.redd.it/27thfy3zgbud1.jpeg,My cat jumped on me post surgery. ,"One week post-op yesterday from a laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy. My cat just jumped onto the pillow on my lap while I was sitting on the couch, feet resting on coffee table with my knees up like this picture (drew it  because it's hard to describe) I lowered my feet off the table and to the floor as he wouldn't get off my lap. It lasted about 10 seconds and it didn't hurt at the moment but I did feel my core engage as if doing an ab exercise. He weighs 12 lbs.

 I'm not sure what to do. My uterus hurts now like I have a period cramp and I'm worried he pulled on the place where my tube was that they sealed and tore it open and now eggs can float in because there's a hole there, and the surgery was all for naught. Does anyone have advice on what to look for from here out?
