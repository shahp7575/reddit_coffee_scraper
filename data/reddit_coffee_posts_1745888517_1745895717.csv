Howdy. Today was mind numbing yearly training for work. I am an owner of one very squishy brain. Need more coffee I think. I work in tech, read a lot, get tattoos, obsess over coffee, love horror movies, philosophy, having long conversations and walks with my dog. Do some working out.

This is a throwaway, and all names are changed to protect… well… me (58F)!

First of all, I LOVE YOU, Charlotte! I hope my fellow potato sleuths have some wisdom for this DNA drama.

So, back in 2019, my daughter (we’ll call her Chloe) did a DNA test through Ancestry. Fast forward to 2022, and she calls me saying, “Who is Travis Smith and how are we related?” Cue dramatic music.

I had no clue. We started digging, and based on the data and his age, we figured Travis had to be my half-brother—making him Chloe’s uncle. Jaw. Drop.

He and I messaged a bit. He tried to talk to his mom, but she shut him down hard. I took a test too, and sure enough—he’s my half-brother.

I told my sister (bless her) who was shocked, but agreed to get tested along with her kids. You guessed it—they all match him too. Now we’re all in Travis’s family tree. We’re even friends on Facebook and he’s messaged asking about my (our) nephews. He’ll be in my state on Mother’s Day, and we’re planning to grab coffee. I’m honestly so excited to meet him.

Here’s the messy part…

At the time Travis was born, both his parents were married… and my dad was married to his current wife—let’s call her Lisa, my stepmother from hell since I was 5. Think evil stepmom in every sense. We’re very low contact.

Now Chloe wants to make an announcement at our next family gathering (yikes), my sister wants to stay silent, and I’m torn.

I want to tell my dad privately. Maybe he already knows. Maybe not. But either way, I feel like he should know, especially now that it’s out there. The others think I should leave it alone.

So tell me: Would I be the a-hole if I told my dad he has an illegitimate son",1,1745895487.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

The back stories are too long to write but what starts as a trickle turns into a broken dam 3 months later. I have never had a red flag like ""can be late often"" or ""leaves his socks on the coffee table"" not eventually turn into ""completely fails to show up for your plans when you're already waiting"" or ""when no longer trying to impress you house looks like a disaster zone and if you move in together this will be your job"". 

Whats weird is red flags in women are literally just personality quirks. Woman who talks too much and asks too few questions about you? She remembers you mentioned not having forks at work and buys you a set. Woman who was late for the last meed up? Apologizes and asks to take you for lunch after. Little things in women are PART of their personality, in men they are the DEFINING features of their personality, little windows into how they will eventually try to exploit you.

I’m finishing up at a Bible college with basically a missions/cultural studies degree. I would like to do something in ministry or missions, but honestly I also just love working at coffee shops. I would love to own a coffee shop someday that I could use for ministry or missions in some way, or maybe have a job where I could travel to different countries for a little while to visit missionaries and see what they do. I know someone who does something like that and I think it would be so cool. Basically, I just love to travel and see different places and what God is doing around the world. It would be really cool to live overseas at some point, but I’m not sure if that will ever be an option. Plus, I’ve moved a lot growing up so it’s hard for me to imagine being in one place for more than like four years.

I’ve been dating my boyfriend (21m) for over a year and a half and we’re hoping to get engaged soon. I love him so very much and really want to spend my life with him. He’s from another country but he wants to live in the US. He’s graduating this year too from the same college and looking for a job in the states.

The thing is, sometimes I feel like I don’t totally want the same life he does (if that makes sense?). There are times I feel this tug to go overseas and do missions work, and he’s more focused on staying and building a life in the US. I asked him if I felt called to go overseas after we were married would he be willing to go, and he said yes as long as he could have a job there. So it’s not like we’re incompatible or anything. I would also love to stay in the US if I found the right ministry job. But sometimes I just feel this tug like maybe I’m doing something wrong?? I wonder if it’s less about a deep calling to missions and more about my desire to experience living overseas, traveling, things like that. It’s also hard because I can’t go overseas for my cross-cultural internship this summer and I’m really sad about missing out on that experience.

I don’t know. I might just need some prayer and insight because I’m feeling a little torn right now...

Not that I dont want to marry him, I really do, but there's just that tug of a thought that I might miss out on what I wanted before we started dating and planning our life together...? Also, right now, marrying him is my only stable plan lol so idk

And since I have mentioned it in a lot of confessions, I did get a lot of DMs to tell exactly how it happened

Last month, I was flying back home — Amman to Bangalore — after a brutal work trip.  
Exhausted, business class ticket in hand, makeup perfect, heels high (obviously, black Louboutin Hot Chicks, my soulmates).

Anyway, I was killing time in the airport lounge, sipping coffee and scrolling through Middle East political updates (nerd alert), when he sat down across from me.

God.

Mid-40s, salt-and-pepper beard, sharp dark eyes, expensive but relaxed clothes — not flashy, but that confident kind of masculine that just *hits you* without trying.

We started talking — about geopolitics, economics, Indian elections, books, travel... and somehow, within minutes, I was laughing like I hadn’t in months.

It wasn’t flirting — not yet.  
It was connection.

Smart. Funny. Challenging. Curious.

The kind of man who *listens* when you speak, but whose every glance feels like a thumbprint being pressed slowly into your skin.

When boarding time came, I should’ve floated off to my luxury seat.

But... no.

Something primal overruled me.

I *wanted* more of that conversation.  
*Needed* more of him.

So yes — I gave up my Business Class seat.  
I literally asked the gate agent to put me in economy next to him.  
Handed my premium ticket to a stunned young techie who couldn’t believe his luck.  
Smiled, grabbed my carry-on, and slipped into Seat XXX — right beside my stranger.

He just smiled when he saw me.  
Like he already knew.

The flight?  
God, it was a tease.

Hours of quiet talk, thigh brushes, shared glances when turbulence jostled us closer.  
At one point, he reached across me to adjust my overhead light — his fingers just grazing my collarbone — and I swear I was ready to *cum* right there.

When we landed in Bangalore at 3 a.m., the sexual tension was so thick it could have suffocated the plane.

I pulled him aside in the terminal, heels clicking sharply on the polished floors.

No games. No coy smiles.

>

He didn’t hesitate.

Room XXX.

As soon as the door clicked shut behind us, he grabbed me — hands in my hair, mouth crushing mine, teeth grazing my lower lip.

My heels clicked against the marble floor as he pushed me back against the wall, lifting my leg high against his hip, grinding his hard cock against my soaked panties.

I was gasping, moaning already:

>

He stripped me ruthlessly — jacket first, then blouse buttons popping one by one, then my skirt bunched around my waist.

But not my heels.

He growled against my throat:

>

God, the way he said it — filthy, commanding — I would have done anything.

He bent me over the edge of the king-size bed, one hand tangled in my hair, the other yanking my panties down and off.

I felt his cock — thick, heavy, perfect — press against my dripping folds.

He didn’t tease.  
He didn’t ask.

He plunged into me with one brutal thrust.

I screamed into the pillow:

>

The sound echoed off the high ceilings, mixing with the rhythmic slap of his hips against my ass, the scrape of my heels against the sheets, the messy wet sounds of pure, filthy need.

He fucked me like a man starved — pounding deep, hitting that perfect spot again and again, dragging moan after shattered moan from my lips.

At one point he pulled out, spun me around, threw me onto my back — my heels kicked up on either side of his broad shoulders — and slammed back inside, riding me hard, deep, claiming every inch of me.

When I finally came — and god, it felt like *falling through a burning star* — I screamed so loud I was sure half the hotel heard:

>

He wasn’t far behind — grunting, growling, cumming deep inside me with brutal, pulsing thrusts that left me gasping and boneless.

We collapsed together — sweaty, panting, stunned.

No words needed.

I left him a note in the morning:

*""Thank you for the best wrong seat of my life.*  
*Find me next time — heels on, doors unlocked.""*

And now I’m back home...  
Still wearing those black Louboutins today.  
Still smiling.

Backstory.  2 years ago in March I had some random ankle and foot swelling and a wicked bruise forming on a cold day that all I really did was make coffee and relax. It got wicked ugly.. didn't hurt all that much overall but some unusual pain points. 

Eventually got it checked out and turned out it was a syndesmotic sprain and I ended up in a boot for 8 weeks. 

In the last few weeks my OTHER ankle had a little swelling and lo and behold a wicked bruise above and around my ankle bone. Oh goodie. 

Went in today to just get it checked out.    Guess who's back in the boot for the other side now? 

All I can think of that caused it was crouching to get laundry out of the dryer. 

Left the doc, and all I could do was laugh when I got in the car because I 100% called it as soon as I saw the bruising..

Oh to be a problematic gumby with bones.

I figured I can get some answers here for someone with some more knowledge on this topic than me. I (M22) have always been a very active person and love a fairly healthy lifestyle. I used to wrestle in high school (126lbs weight class my senior year @ 5’9) and definitely used to abuse my body since that was what you had to do for wrestling at a high level which created eating disorders and a lot lot lot of starving yourself and dehydrating yourself weekly to make weight. That was 4-5 years ago now and sure the eating disorders have gone away but I have been very active in other sports to fill that void and never had a major increase in weight just mainly muscle and slight increase in body fat % since then but more of a healthy increase in weight since I was not starving my body anymore. Quite recently maybe for about 6-7 months I have noticed some rapid weight gain that I have never experienced before and just want to know what the reason it is and if there has been any change in my lifestyle that is the root of it, I recently graduated college and working a 9-5 as an engineer and don’t really have the opportunity to be as active but still try to get out there when I can especially on weekends and really put my body through a lot on the weekends and occasionally throughout the week after work. One thing I have done consistently is drink vanilla lattes in the morning mainly because I hate the taste of straight black coffee but still need that boost of energy for work. Can that be the main reason? And would I see the effects of not drinking caffeine in that form over time or will I need to do more now to burn this unwanted weight. To clarify I am still not overweight just noticing more belly fat and losing my jawline slightly but just want to tackle the problem while I’m young before it’s too late. I’m also currently 5’10” roughly 168-170lbs but I swore to never step on a scale due to the mental challenges of wrestling and making weight on the scale sounds dumb but it’s just something that makes me feel comfortable.

### [✅ Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://4bdf3kthv1v33p4jsfs7cf3n5c.hop.clickbank.net)

# My Problem Before MITOLYN

Before I found MITOLYN, I felt like I was dragging myself through each day. I woke up tired, even after a full night’s sleep. By the afternoon, my brain felt foggy and my body just wanted to flop onto the couch. I tried eating healthier, drinking more water, and even took other supplements, but nothing really helped. It was frustrating. I wanted to feel awake, focused, and happy again, but I just didn’t know how.

On top of the tiredness, I noticed I was irritable and had a hard time remembering simple things. My friends teased me about my “goldfish memory.” Honestly, it started to make me feel old and grumpy, even though I’m not that old!

# First Impressions Matter – And MITOLYN Nails It

When my MITOLYN package arrived, I was surprised by how nice it looked. The box felt sturdy and had a cool, simple design. The instructions were straightforward—no confusing science words or tiny print you can’t read. I liked that everything was organized and made me feel like I was opening a gift instead of just another bottle of pills.

One thing I noticed right away was how easy it was to add MITOLYN to my routine. No messy powders or weird tastes—just a small, easy-to-swallow supplement. I appreciated that, since I already have enough going on every morning!

# The Results Were Almost Instant

I’m not joking when I say I started feeling different in just a few days. The first thing I noticed was my energy. I woke up without that heavy, sleepy feeling, and I didn’t crash after lunch like I used to. I felt lighter, like my body was finally working with me instead of against me.

By the end of my first week, my mind felt clearer. I could focus on my work and remember things better. I even had the motivation to go for a walk after dinner, something I hadn’t done in months.

After a month, my friends started noticing I was in a better mood. I didn’t snap at little things anymore. I actually laughed more and felt like myself again. Six months in, these changes stuck around. My skin even looked healthier, and I rarely got sick. I was amazed!

# Why MITOLYN Stands Out

I’ve tried a lot of things that promised big results, but MITOLYN is different. Here’s why:

✅ **Clean, Quality Ingredients**  
I checked the label and did some research. MITOLYN uses ingredients that are natural and safe. No weird chemicals or junk I couldn’t pronounce. That made me feel good about putting it in my body every day.

✅ **It Really Works**  
The biggest thing for me was how quickly I noticed changes. I didn’t have to wait months to feel a little bit better. The energy, focus, and mood boost came fast and kept getting better the longer I used it.

✅ **Gentle on My System**  
Some supplements upset my stomach, but not MITOLYN. I had zero side effects. No jitters, no headaches—just smooth, natural energy and focus.

✅ **Worth the Money**  
MITOLYN isn’t the cheapest supplement out there, but it actually saved me money. I stopped buying coffee every afternoon and didn’t need extra snacks to keep me awake. Plus, feeling good is priceless.

✅ **Tons of Happy Customers**  
I’m not the only one who loves this stuff. I read reviews from all kinds of people who had the same great results. That made me trust the company even more.

# People Around Me Noticed

This part made me smile the most. My friends and family started asking what changed. My best friend said, “You look happier. What’s your secret?” My partner noticed I was more patient and less stressed. Even my coworkers asked if I was doing something new because I seemed more energetic in meetings.

A few of them tried MITOLYN after I told them about it. They all came back with the same excited stories—better energy, better focus, and even better moods. It was fun to see everyone feeling their best!

# Customer Support That Actually Cares

There was one time my order got delayed because of a shipping problem (not MITOLYN’s fault). I emailed their support team and got a friendly reply the same day. They tracked my package, kept me updated, and even sent a little thank-you note for my patience. It felt really nice to know real people were there to help me, not just robots or canned responses.

That kind of service is rare these days, and it made me like the company even more.

# Would I Recommend MITOLYN?

Yes, I would! I’ve already told my family, friends, and even my neighbors about MITOLYN. I only recommend things that really help me, and this is one of those rare products I feel good telling everyone about.

If you’re tired of feeling sluggish or forgetful, or if you just want to feel like yourself again, I’d say give MITOLYN a try. It made a huge difference for me, and I think it could do the same for you.

# Final Thoughts – Worth Every Penny

Trying MITOLYN was one of the best decisions I’ve made for my health and happiness. It gave me back my energy, cleared my mind, and lifted my mood. I feel like I got a piece of my life back, and that’s something you can’t put a price on.

If you’re on the fence, I get it—I was too. But after 180 days, I can honestly say MITOLYN is worth every penny. Life feels easier, more fun, and more manageable. I’m grateful I took the chance.

So if you want to feel better, think clearer, and enjoy each day a little more, MITOLYN is the way to go. Give yourself a chance to feel your best—you deserve it!

# The Slow Burn of Fatigue and Hopelessness

Not too long ago, I felt like my body was running on empty. It wasn’t just being tired; it was like my energy was slowly slipping away, day by day. I’d wake up already exhausted, and by the afternoon, it felt like I was moving underwater. No matter how much I slept, I never felt rested.

I went to the doctor, hoping for answers. They ran all the usual tests—blood work, thyroid, vitamins. Everything looked “normal.” But nothing about how I felt was normal. I wasn’t sick, but I definitely wasn’t well. My brain felt cloudy, my motivation was gone, and even simple things like making dinner felt impossible.

It felt like I was losing myself, and that scared me. I tried coffee, naps, and every “energy” product I could find, but nothing helped for long. I started to wonder if this was just how life would be from now on.

# What Is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is a supplement aimed at helping your body make energy the way it’s supposed to. It’s not a quick fix or a sugar rush. The real magic is in how it supports your mitochondria—the tiny parts inside your cells that create the energy you need to think, move, and feel alive.

As we get older, our mitochondria can get tired, just like we do. That means less energy, more sluggishness, and even trouble with memory or focus. MITOLYN is designed to nourish those mitochondria, so your body can bounce back and feel energized from the inside out.

When I first read about this, it actually made sense. Maybe my problem wasn’t just “getting older” or “stress.” Maybe my body just needed a little help powering up again.

# Why I Took the Leap

I’ll admit, I didn’t want to waste any more money on things that didn’t work. I’d tried so many “miracle” supplements that left me disappointed (or just jittery). But what convinced me to give MITOLYN a shot were the stories from real people who sounded just like me. They talked about having more energy, clearer thinking, and even better sleep—without the crash or nervousness.

I also looked up the science for myself. MITOLYN uses ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and NAD+ boosters, which have actual research behind them. It wasn’t just hype or a new trend; there were facts to back it up.

So, I took a deep breath and ordered my first bottle, hoping this would finally be the answer.

# Week 1: Subtle But Promising

The first few days, I didn’t expect much. I was so used to feeling tired that I doubted anything could really help. But by the end of the week, I noticed I was getting out of bed a little easier. I didn’t hit the snooze button three times. My usual afternoon slump wasn’t as bad, and I was drinking less coffee.

It wasn’t a huge change, but it made me hopeful. For the first time in a long time, I felt like maybe things could get better.

# Week 2: Clarity, Focus, Drive

During the second week, things really started to shift. My mind felt sharper, and it was easier to finish things at work and at home. I wasn’t constantly distracted or overwhelmed. I even found myself looking forward to hobbies I’d given up because I was always too tired.

My friends noticed too—they said I seemed happier and more “myself.” I was smiling and laughing more, and it felt genuine. I realized I’d missed this version of me.

# Week 3: Energy Like I Had in My 20s

By the third week, I felt like a new person. I had the kind of steady, all-day energy I hadn’t felt since I was much younger. I started taking evening walks, playing with my kids, and actually cooking dinner instead of grabbing takeout. It wasn’t a fake, wired feeling—it was real.

My body didn’t ache as much. I felt lighter, inside and out. I wasn’t just getting through the day; I was actually enjoying it.

# Week 4: Deep Sleep and Radiant Health

One of the biggest surprises was how much better I started sleeping. I used to toss and turn for hours, but now I’d fall asleep quickly and wake up refreshed. My skin looked brighter, my digestion improved, and even my mood swings seemed to calm down.

It was like my whole body was working together again. I felt healthier, happier, and more confident.

# The Ingredients That Make It Work

MITOLYN uses a blend of ingredients that are backed by science, not just wishful thinking. Here’s what’s inside and why it matters:

- **PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone):** Helps your cells grow more mitochondria and keeps them running smoothly.
- **CoQ10:** Essential for turning food into energy at the cellular level.
- **NAD+ Precursors:** These help your cells repair themselves and fight aging.
- **L-Carnitine and ALCAR:** Support brain function and help the body use fat for fuel.
- **B-Vitamins and Magnesium:** Help with stress, nerve health, and keeping your energy levels steady.

There are no artificial fillers, weird chemicals, or harsh stimulants. Just ingredients that your body recognizes and can actually use.

# Who Should Try MITOLYN?

If you wake up tired, struggle to focus, or feel older than you should, MITOLYN might help you like it helped me. It’s not just for “old” people—anyone who feels burnt out, foggy, or low on energy could benefit.

Even if you’ve tried other supplements with no luck, I think MITOLYN is worth a shot. I wish I hadn’t waited so long to try it, and I think a lot of other people could get their spark back too.

# Final Verdict: Don't Wait Like I Did

Looking back, I wish I hadn’t spent so much time feeling miserable and thinking it was all in my head. MITOLYN gave me back my energy, my focus, and my joy. If you’re on the fence, please don’t wait until you hit rock bottom like I did.

You deserve to feel good every day, not just “okay.” I’m so grateful I took a chance and tried MITOLYN—maybe it’s your turn now. Give yourself the chance to feel alive again. You might be surprised at how much your life can change.",0,1745894375.0,Pinback,0,0.5,False

# My Problem Before MITOLYN

Before MITOLYN became a part of my routine, I was stuck in what felt like a never-ending loop. Every morning I’d wake up feeling tired, no matter how long I slept. My energy would fizzle out before lunchtime. I found myself yawning in meetings, reaching for coffee after coffee, and struggling to keep up with my family and work. My brain felt foggy, and sometimes I’d forget even the simplest things.

I tried everything I could think of—more sleep, less sugar, new exercise routines, and a whole bunch of vitamins. But nothing seemed to make a real difference. I even started to wonder if this was just how life was supposed to feel as an adult.

I was frustrated and honestly, a little hopeless. That’s when I started reading about MITOLYN and the science behind it. My curiosity turned into hope, and I figured, “Why not? I’ve got nothing to lose.”

# First Impressions Matter – And MITOLYN Nails It

When MITOLYN arrived, I was pleasantly surprised. The box looked clean and modern, and it didn’t feel cheap or thrown together. The instructions were clear and easy to follow, so getting started was a breeze. It even came with a little booklet explaining how the product works and tips for getting the best results, which made me feel like the company actually cared about my experience.

Unlike other products that made me feel like just another customer, MITOLYN felt more personal and trustworthy right from the start. I could tell that a lot of thought went into every step, from the way it was packaged to the helpful instructions.

# The Results Were Almost Instant

The first big surprise? How quickly I felt the difference. After just a few days, I noticed I wasn’t dragging myself out of bed anymore. My mornings felt brighter, and I didn’t need that extra cup of coffee to get going.

By the end of the first week, I could focus better at work and was finishing my tasks faster than usual. My afternoon energy slumps started to disappear. I felt more motivated to exercise, and even my mood was better. I was way less cranky and more patient with everyone around me.

Instead of waiting and hoping for change, I could actually feel it happening. It was like someone had turned up the brightness on my whole day.

# Why MITOLYN Stands Out

MITOLYN isn’t just another bottle on the shelf. Here’s why I think it’s different:

- **Top-Quality Ingredients**: I checked the label and did my research. MITOLYN uses real, natural ingredients with no weird chemicals or fillers. That made me feel safe taking it every day.
- **It Really Works**: There’s no guessing. I could feel the change in my energy, focus, and mood. It wasn’t just me; my friends and family noticed it, too.
- **No Bad Side Effects**: I’ve tried supplements before that upset my stomach or made me feel weird. MITOLYN was gentle and easy to take.
- **Good Value**: Sure, there are cheaper options out there, but none I’ve tried gave me results like this. I stopped buying other stuff because I didn’t need it anymore.
- **Trusted by Thousands**: Seeing so many positive reviews from real people gave me confidence. It’s not just hype—MITOLYN actually delivers.

# People Around Me Noticed

One of the coolest things about using MITOLYN was how people started asking about my secret. My family told me I seemed happier and more energetic. Even my coworkers commented on how focused I was during meetings (no more sneaky yawns!). Friends wanted to know what had changed.

When I told them about MITOLYN, several decided to try it themselves. Every single one came back with the same message: “I feel so much better!” It’s fun to see others benefit, too.

# Customer Support That Actually Cares

I had a minor mix-up with my order—nothing big, just a shipping question. When I reached out to customer support, they responded quickly and kindly. They sorted out my issue in no time and even followed up to make sure everything was okay.

It’s rare to find a company that actually listens and helps you. With MITOLYN, I felt like they really cared about my experience, not just my money.

# Would I Recommend MITOLYN?

Absolutely! I’ve already told my family, my friends, and even my neighbors about MITOLYN. I don’t usually recommend things unless I really believe in them, but this is one product I’m happy to stand behind.

If you’re feeling tired, unfocused, or just not yourself, I’d say give MITOLYN a try. It could be the change you’ve been looking for.

# Final Thoughts – Worth Every Penny

Looking back, I’m so glad I took the chance on MITOLYN. My days are brighter, my energy is up, and life just feels easier. I’m able to be present for my family, do my job better, and even enjoy my hobbies more.

MITOLYN isn’t magic, but it’s the closest thing I’ve found to a real-life boost. I feel healthier, happier, and more confident. If you’ve been searching for something that actually helps, MITOLYN is it.

If you’re ready to stop feeling stuck and start feeling great, I say go for it. MITOLYN changed my life, and I think it can change yours too.

MHey all,

I’m a bearded and tattooed 39 year old guy that is pretty bored and lonely.  I have a family but I can’t help but feel empty I guess. Let’s fix it.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes work sends me places so maybe we can meet if I end up near you. I play music badly, write songs that I sing over this bad music. Well, kind of growl since I’m a metalhead and singing is silly. Also I can’t sing.

I’m love a good coffee and a recipe. I love sharing both. I enjoy reading probably as much as I do writing, a bit more sometimes. I enjoy a good drink. Scotch is my main one, I am pretty good at making any mixed drink. I love to bartend when people are over.

You? Want to come over for a drink? Not really, an online drink I suppose. Maybe we can talk about the above stuff. Some things I didn’t mention. Let me know you and you know me and we’ll see where it goes.

# My Struggle with Exhaustion and Mental Fog

My story starts like a lot of people’s: always feeling tired, struggling to concentrate, and wondering where my energy went. Every morning, I’d drag myself out of bed, wishing I could just sleep a little longer. The tiredness wouldn’t go away, even after a full night’s rest. On top of that, my mind felt cloudy. It was hard to focus at work, and even simple tasks seemed overwhelming.

I tried everything I could think of—eating better, exercising more, even trying different vitamins and energy drinks. But nothing worked for long. I started to feel hopeless, thinking maybe this was just what getting older felt like. I missed feeling sharp and energetic, the way I used to. That’s when I decided to give MITOLYN a try.

# The First Impressions of MITOLYN

I first heard about MITOLYN from a friend who had battled similar problems with tiredness and brain fog. She told me she’d noticed a big difference since she started using it. I was a bit skeptical, but I did my own research and was surprised by what I found.

MITOLYN isn’t just another vitamin—it’s specially made to help your cells produce more energy by supporting your mitochondria, which are like tiny power plants inside your body. I liked that the ingredients were natural and there were no weird chemicals or fillers. The more I read, the more hopeful I became that this could be the answer I was looking for.

# Week 1: Subtle But Positive Changes

The first week, I didn’t expect miracles, but I paid close attention to how I felt. Instead of bouncing out of bed, I just felt a little less heavy in the mornings. It was a small change, but I could tell I wasn’t as groggy as usual.

Something else I noticed: my mind seemed a bit clearer. I wasn’t forgetting things as much, and it was easier to focus on what I was doing. I didn’t feel like a brand-new person yet, but even these small shifts gave me hope. It felt like I was finally moving in the right direction.

# Week 2: Increased Energy and Less Mental Fog

By the second week, the changes got stronger. I started waking up feeling actually rested, not just less tired. I didn’t need that extra cup of coffee in the afternoon anymore, and I wasn’t getting that usual crash where I wanted to nap at my desk.

My mental fog lifted even more—I could remember things better, focus on my work, and even keep up with conversations without zoning out. I was also sleeping better at night, falling asleep faster and waking up less. It felt like MITOLYN was helping my whole body work better, not just giving me a short-term boost.

# Week 3: Transformation in My Daily Life

By the third week, I realized I wasn’t just getting my energy back—I was getting my life back. I started doing things I’d put off for ages, like working on hobbies, going for walks, and catching up with friends. My motivation returned, and I felt excited to take on new challenges.

Even my mood improved. When you’re tired all the time, it’s easy to feel down or irritable. But as my energy and focus came back, I felt happier and more confident. I could keep up at work, enjoy time with my family, and just feel like myself again. MITOLYN didn’t just make me feel less tired—it made me feel alive.

# The Science Behind MITOLYN: Why It Works

What makes MITOLYN different from other supplements is that it works at the cellular level. Our bodies have little engines inside each cell called mitochondria, and they make the energy we need to live, think, and move. When our mitochondria get tired, so do we.

MITOLYN uses ingredients that help mitochondria work better. Here are a few of the main ones:

- **CoQ10:** This helps your cells produce energy and protects them from damage.
- **Acetyl-L-Carnitine:** Supports your brain and helps turn fat into energy.
- **PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone):** Helps your body grow new mitochondria, making your energy system even stronger.
- **NAD+ Boosters:** These help your cells keep making energy as you get older.

By combining these ingredients, MITOLYN doesn’t just cover up tiredness—it helps fix it at the source. Over time, your whole body starts to feel more balanced and energized.

# Why You Should Try MITOLYN

If you’re still unsure about trying MITOLYN, I get it—I was skeptical too. But after a year of using it, I can honestly say it’s made a huge difference in my life. If you’re tired of feeling worn out, scattered, or just not yourself, this could be the answer you’re looking for.

MITOLYN isn’t a quick fix or a magic pill, but it helps your body work the way it’s supposed to. You’ll have more energy to enjoy your day, more focus to do well at school or work, and a better mood to share with the people you care about. And it’s made from clean, trustworthy ingredients, so you can feel good about what you’re taking.

A simple fix that has helped me is making protein pancakes using a low-carb whey protein powder (like Premier Protein).

You just mix a scoop of protein powder, two eggs, a little almond flour, and baking powder. It cooks just like pancakes but keeps your carbs low and your protein high. I usually pair it with turkey bacon, scrambled eggs, and black coffee. It feels like a full, normal breakfast without wrecking your blood sugar.

High-protein, low-carb meals help stabilize blood sugar, prevent insulin spikes, keep you full for hours, and can even help with weight loss if you're intermittent fasting like I am. Plus, it still feels like you're eating real food instead of being stuck with bland ""diet"" meals.

This works way better than cereal, toast, or fruit-heavy breakfasts, which cause blood sugar spikes even if they seem healthy.

My boyfriend and I have been together for over 2 and a half years, I know everyone says it but our relationship was truly perfect. I felt like everything I had been through in my life was for a reason because it led me to him. He was so unbelievably kind, supportive of everything I did, patient, understanding of my anxiety and autism, reassuring, caring, he was everything I could have ever dreamed of. If we had an argument or disagreement, we would sit down and talk about it and come up with a solution, apologize, and remind each other that we love each other. I can’t count the amount of times I thought “I didn’t know life could be this easy”. We lived together, we were getting married, we had our whole wedding planned, our whole life planned, everything. We were hoping to move away together within the next year. It was not fake, it was not lovebombing. It was over 2 years of being in a wonderful, beautiful, healthy partnership.

He got laid off last fall and became very depressed over it especially as it was so close to Christmas and he didn’t want me to feel like I had to help him out with money. I ended up getting very frustrated with him and our financial situation and I told him to get out of bed and go get a part time job. I was mean to him. I was straight up mean.
He applied for jobs and didn’t hear anything back, so out of desperation he reached out to a shitty friend of his and got a job working at a friend of a friend’s business. And that’s when everything went wrong. I had a bad feeling about it from the beginning and I told him but he reassured me it would be okay. But it wasn’t. Turns out the friend who got him the job was a drug dealer and so was the owner of the business, and they just started constantly giving my boyfriend cocaine, knowing he had a problem with it in the past and had been doing really well for years. I caught on pretty early and my boyfriend admitted it. But he didn’t stop working there. This man had my boyfriend doing everything for him, working every single day without a day off, using my car to run errands for his business, having him build things for his new bar, having him sell things for him online, I think my boyfriend was scared to say no to him at some point. 
This “friend” he was working for started grooming him to hate me. I caught on to that fast too. My boyfriend started saying things to me that made no sense and were so unlike him, I’d ask him who put these things into his head. Things like him being scared of me and scared I’d hurt him and hurt our animals, saying I was stalking him because I would bring him coffee at work and last week went to his work and called and asked if he could come give me a hug because I had a really horrible day (to which his response was no because “the boys” at work would judge him). I read his phone and his friends were constantly calling me crazy and a she-devil and saying they’d give him a “safe exit” from me. When I asked him, he said he never wanted to leave me and wanted to work on any issues and get married some day. 

He started yelling at me and verbally abusing me. It wasn’t often at first, and then it was constantly. Because he was constantly on coke. Calling me selfish, calling me a cunt and a whore and a bitch, saying I’m not a nice person, that I’m worse than his abusive ex, that I was the worst person he ever met in his life. He would ramble on and on and none of it made sense and all I could do is cry because I was watching the man I loved who I was going to spend my life with turn into someone I didn’t recognize. 

He stopped doing coke for 2 weeks and it was like I had my boyfriend back. He stopped because he was going away to work. We were communicating again, spending time together, our sex life was normal, nobody yelled, I really thought everything was going to be okay. And then his drug dealer friend’s sister passed away and he went down to his house the next day and I knew he was on coke again before he even got home. And it only got worse. 
On Friday he went to work in the morning and we had sex that morning, cuddled, and before he left for work he said “I love you more than you’ll ever know, don’t forget it”. He dropped back in the afternoon and gave me a hug and a kiss and told me he loved me and he’d be home after the wake. And I guess after the wake him and his friends did a shit ton of coke because he went insane. He asked me to bring something down to him at work so I did, and halfway there he called me screaming at me that I’m insane and I’m stalking him and I’m selfish and evil, and I pulled up at his work and said I brought things down for him and tried to give him a hug, and he ran up the stairs screaming “help, this woman is trying to hurt me, that woman there, she’s gonna hurt me”. I asked his boss wtf was happening and he said he didn’t know and they were just having “drinks” after the wake and my boyfriend was sick of me “bothering” him. So I left and went home and my boyfriend called me to pick him up around midnight, and when I did he was angry at me in the car because I “turned his friend against him”, I guess his boss got upset with seeing the way he treated me. I told him to just chill out in the car and come inside and go to bed when he was ready.
I went in and got in bed and that’s when all hell broke loose, he came in saying “oh the little pussy is gone to bed, you’re a coward” and then went on another 30 minute unhinged ramble that made no sense, he twice said he would “beat the ever living fuck out of me” and “punch me the fuck out” if I spoke, and when I finally tried to speak at the end, he poured two cans of beer over my head and opened another and threw it in my face and got it in my eyes, he grabbed my hair and put his face next to mine and said “do you really want to fucking do this?” and I was sobbing and begged him to stop and I got back on the bed and he followed me and I couldn’t stop crying so he covered my mouth with his hand and then plugged my nose at the same time until I was smacking him to get off because I couldn’t breathe, and then he took the blanket off the bed and held it over my face. I managed to get free and he ran down the hallway screaming “why are you hurting me? Why are you hitting me?” I guess to try and make the neighbours think I was hurting him. He grabbed me and kissed me and bit my lip really hard and then he kicked me in the leg and at some point I ended up on the floor and he was on top of me trying to cover my mouth again and he hit me 3 times in the side of the head and he was telling me to open my eyes and look at him and tried to pry them open with his hands. I got him off of me somehow and ran outside with my phone and called the police and they arrested him and charged him and he spent the weekend in jail and was released on bail today and all I feel is guilt for calling the police and doing that to him even though he hurt me so badly. I have a black eye and bruises all over my face and arms and legs. But all I can do is cry because he hasn’t even tried to contact me to say sorry since he got out and I still love him with my whole heart despite what he did and I know it’s stupid but I can’t stop loving him. This person wasn’t him, it was a monster that drugs made him into. And I don’t know how to cope or go on because my entire future we planned is gone and I don’t know how to even wake up on the morning without him and I don’t want to at this point. It hurts too bad.

what type of profit margin should we be striving for. these are high school students and i want to make it available to all but still be able to make profit from this. 

Are there any other drinks you guys would recommend we start off with. i would prefer something simple but am open to any ideas that could benefit the students for next year. 

Any specific brands of plant based milks or creams or foams that might be better to use than others?

We had patched things up since the end of March, and I really thought we were okay. But just last week, he told me that during the time we weren’t talking (although, to be fair, we were still communicating—it was just mostly arguments), he started talking to someone he met on Reddit and even met up with her. I’m not even sure if that’s the whole truth or if he’s hiding something more.

This isn’t the first time. He did something similar before the pandemic. And now here we are, back in the same situation. What’s worse is that he’s trying to flip the situation on me, saying I did the same thing just because I talked to someone. But the person he’s talking about is a friend I’ve known since high school. There was nothing romantic or flirty in our conversation (which he saw), yet he insists it’s the same. I didn’t meet that friend in person, and I definitely didn’t see him as a rebound—it was just casual, friendly chatting.

Meanwhile, he admitted to deliberately going on Reddit to look for a rebound and even went on a coffee date.

Now he has the nerve to say that he won’t post about me on social media anymore. He doesn’t visit as often as he used to—he used to come over every other day, now it’s just once a week, sometimes not even that. And I have to be the one asking him to come.

Now I’m wondering: is this still worth fighting for? We have shared properties, we’re engaged, and we were planning to get married this year. It’s hard to detach. We’ve been together for almost seven years, and I come from a conservative family—calling off the engagement would be a huge disappointment for them",1,1745893689.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

I ended up getting a interview for a big company and they were literally paying half of what I was making at my old job. I accepted the job just so I would have some money coming in. Before my start date I just had a feeling that something better would come in so I ended up turning down the offer in hopes something better would come up. 

A little over a week later I got a call from a top company in my city asking me to come in for an interview.   The interview was rough, I was in a room with a couple people from HR and a couple engineers and they just drilled me with questions for an hour. I walked out feeling like I absolutely bombed it.  When I got to my car I did a 5 minute manifestation routine where I imagined myself working there, I put the gps on to see how close the gym was to this new job for my morning workouts, and I also looked how far the closest Starbucks was for coffee runs. I really acted in my head like I already had the job.  I went home and totally forgot about the whole interview. 2 days later I ended up getting a call that they wanted me to start ASAP! They even offered me extra perks that weren’t discussed in my interview.

We aren’t in the coffee business!  We are in the people business!
And we are people too and it is about time that they start treating us like people.  Back to Starbucks!  How about you give us some staff!  How about you stop making our Store Managers work 60+ hour weeks and cover 2+ stores!  How about you stop making all these promises to bring us to a proper “coffee house” experience and then chop all sense of personality and uniqueness out of us!

- **Local partner** — broadly DMV-based

# What is Joe Sugarman - The Lost Sugarman Tapes All About?

*Joe Sugarman - The Lost Sugarman Tapes* is like stumbling onto a hidden goldmine for marketers, entrepreneurs, and copywriters. These tapes are rare recordings of what many call the very first ""big marketing seminar"" ever — run by none other than the legendary Joe Sugarman himself. Despite the grainy video and wonky audio (seriously, it’s rough), the real treasure is the knowledge dropped during these sessions. It's not a polished Hollywood production — it's raw, real, and full of priceless strategies that built empires.

# Who Should Care About These Tapes?

If you’re into marketing, copywriting, selling products, or just learning from *the best*, then *Joe Sugarman - The Lost Sugarman Tapes* should be high on your radar. Think about it: companies like Victoria’s Secret, Sharper Image, and Omaha Steaks all sent their teams to learn from this guy. This isn't just any seminar recording — it’s a masterclass in persuasion from the man who sold 20 million pairs of sunglasses and revolutionized direct marketing.

# When and Where Were These Tapes Created?

Way back in the 1980s, when marketing seminars were just starting to become a thing, Joe Sugarman ran what would become a legendary event. It wasn’t your typical hotel conference with PowerPoint slides. It was Joe, in all his unfiltered brilliance, sharing what worked (and what didn’t) from his own hard-earned success. The recordings were made then, misplaced for decades, and only recently unearthed and digitally enhanced — even if they’re still a little ""vintage"" in quality.

# Why Are The Lost Sugarman Tapes Important Today?

You might think, ""Marketing from the '80s? Pfft, we have TikTok now!"" But here’s the truth: human psychology hasn’t changed. The principles Joe teaches — crafting irresistible offers, understanding customer behavior, selling with authenticity — are *timeless*. Whether you're selling NFTs, coaching packages, or coffee mugs, *Joe Sugarman - The Lost Sugarman Tapes* can hand you a marketing playbook that’s still insanely effective in 2025 and beyond.

# How Do You Get Access to These Gems?

Simple. They’re now available digitally — but with a catch. Only a limited number of people can get in. You’ll get lifetime access to all 21 sessions, full transcripts, a massive swipe file of Joe’s ads, and even bonus material from other marketing legends like Mark Joyner and Ted Nicholas. Plus, it comes with a no-questions-asked 30-day guarantee. So if you feel it’s not the right fit (unlikely, but hey, it happens), you get your cash back.

# Final Thoughts on Joe Sugarman - The Lost Sugarman Tapes

Look, if you can handle a little fuzzy video and some old-school charm, *Joe Sugarman - The Lost Sugarman Tapes* might just be the best investment you make in your marketing education. It's not flashy. It's not polished. But it *is* pure marketing wisdom from a guy who’s done it all — from selling the world’s first cordless phone to pioneering the use of 800 numbers. If you get a chance to grab these tapes, don’t think twice. They’re a once-in-a-lifetime find.

1kacwan,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExecutiveAssistants/comments/1kacwan/my_boss_never_respects_my_time/,My boss never respects my time,"I’ve been working at this company for about 2.5 years, my boss and I have a weekly 30-minute catch up to run through any items I need to lay past him. He consistently shows up late to these meetings, without so much as an apology. 

Last week I set a catch up for one hour as we have a lot of items to run through and I can’t proceed without his input, he was 25 minutes late to this meeting and barely apologised. When he sat down I shut the door to his office and begin the meeting, 5 minutes later a colleague just opens the door and proceeds to chat with my boss. The two of them are just gossiping away, wasting now about 40 minutes of the hour meeting I set, leaving me with 20 minutes to rush through my items. I did get a bit frustrated and told both of them that I need to get started with this meeting and they should catch up after. This happens so often in our meetings people will just interrupt and my boss never tells them to wait (it’s never for anything urgent otherwise I would understand). 

My boss is always late to our meetings for minor reasons like because he needs to get a coffee. Today he is late to our meeting because he needed to pick up a parcel from the post office (I always make sure he gets an hour lunch so he has plenty of time to do this in his lunch break). 

Oftentimes, we will finally sit down in a meeting and he will accept phone calls forcing me to sit there and wait, or he actually sits there on his phone and gets distracted, meaning I have to repeat myself multiple times and he isn’t engaged.

I’ve given him feedback in my performance reviews, and stated that I sometimes feel that he doesn’t value my time. I have pointed out that my job is to support him, however when he treats our meetings like this it doesn’t enable me to do my job well and therefore he isn’t maximising his support. 

I’m at my wits end trying to figure out how to get him to stay focused and actually respect my time.

I've now been consistently going to the gym (pf) for about 8 months 3-4x/week on average. I tend to do ~45 minutes weights and ~25 minutes cardio every day. I try to do at least 1 day arms, 1 day chest/shoulders, and 1 day back and then any extra days I'll just repeat arms or chest. Due to my daily running/biking I'm pretty happy with my legs so I don't do too much in the way of direct leg exercises. I'm 35yo, 6'3"", ~220lb with ~27% body fat (if my scale can be trusted) so cardio is pretty important to me because I'm worried about my heart health due to my size.

For food, I don't eat until lunch (just a splash of half and half in my coffee). Lunch is usually a smoothie (with plain yogurt, fruit, seeds, and nuts), bran flakes with peanut butter, or chicken breast with brown rice and some veggie. Snack is apple with peanut butter. Dinner is whatever my family is eating so my diet is pretty unregulated. Sometimes it's just like a lentil soup, sometimes it's pizza. I really don't have much say in dinner.

Here's my spreadsheet that keeps track of my gym progress. You can probably skip the first month or so because I was mostly just figuring out which exercises and machines felt right. I'm sure the weights dropped in a lot of categories around november/december when I started doing them more correctly. I basically always push to failure for at least my last set. Sometimes my last two. You can tell with the reps dropping at the end of each exercise. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j0_zsPIQk68f7v3zSvpjplJ0JwlWSqtoI3m14T-hc8s/edit?usp=sharing

I feel super stalled. I guess I'd say I'm mostly trying and failing to cut, but if I'm not cutting shouldn't I at least be getting some muscle? My arms exercise weights are not progressing at ALL. My chest/back/shoulders are either stalled or super slow progress. My weight is also barely progressing. I'm not in a position where I can dedicate any more time to the gym.

1kacvo7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1kacvo7/am_i_overreacting_for_being_bothered_by_the_fact/,Am I Overreacting for being bothered by the fact that my ex girlfriend still tries to have a relationship with my family?,"This one is a bit messy. I met my now ex girlfriend a little over 2 years ago. We've been broken up for quite a while but stayed on and off throughout the last 2 years. Your typical situationship. We've spent a ton of time together and a huge chunk of it has been at my house around my family. I live with my parents. My brother and sister in law and my 2 nephews live directly across the street. Inevitably, over time she became close with my family and my sister in law is now one of her best friends. Her and my mother also grew very close and she's in love with my nephews who are 3 and 5. I've told her on many occasions that it makes me uncomfortable that she still talks to and sees my mom. I've also expressed my feelings to my mom. They've both said that it was wrong, but I'm not sure if they genuinely mean that or are just telling me what I want to hear. From what I'm told, she doesn't spend time with or talk to my mom hardly ever, within let's say, the last 6 months or so. My mom works at a chiropractors office and my ex goes there for care, so I know they see each other somewhat regularly but I obviously don't consider that a hang. However, just the other day my mom says ""we're taking the boys to the park"" meaning, my sister in law and my ex. Didn't mention that my ex was tagging along...I found out when she pulled up across the street. Remember, my sister in law is one of her besties. I was pulling out of the driveway when they were leaving themselves, and my mom gave me what looked like a ""is he mad look"". Minutes later my ex texted me and said ""good luck fishing"". Not sure how she even knew I was going fishing?? Anyway, I didn't respond because I was obviously irritated and I know they knew I was also. That was the most recent occurrence. There's been many times where my ex has been at my house when I wasn't around when we weren't on good terms, hanging out with my mom and MY dog. I found this out way after the fact. Shady shit. She has also taken MY dog on car rides to who knows where without my permission and I found out way after the fact. I've never really set any boundaries between us and our relationship, besides what I'm speaking of now. She has crossed that boundary time and time again and she'll ask me ""are you upset/mad at me?"" Then she'll try to justify it with some bullshit excuse as to why she's talking to or seeing my mom. It puts me in a bad mood for days sometimes and I just avoid talking to them because I refuse to speak my mind any further at this point. They know what's wrong, but they'll ask me what's wrong. I try not to let it bother me, but it does. It effects my relationship with my mom and ex and the fact that they know I'll be bothered but they continue to cross my boundaries, makes me feel disrespected and maybe slightly betrayed. Recently, my ex bought my mom a coffee mug and brought it to her at my house. She did ask permission to do that because she didn't want me to get upset, but I just said ""that's super unnecessary but do you."" Which she agreed it was unnecessary. Not long after, she wanted to plan a road trip to some waterfalls or some shit with just my mom and asked my permission for that. The fact that she keeps putting me in this situation truly pisses me off and makes us grow even more distant. She even wrote on my aunt and uncles Facebook pages happy birthday(they have the same birthday) and she's never been close with them. I've expressed my feelings, but I've never told them to cut ties because I don't want to be controlling. We have tried to have a good relationship as friends, but stuff like this makes it incredibly difficult and I've about had enough of it. I just want to know if I'm being irrational or overreacting about all of this, but I can't help the fact that it bothers me and stresses me out. Any input would be super helpful y'all.

Ive been trying to be proactive. I had a great coffee chat with a Manager on the team, and after our conversation, she introduced me to another team member with who I have a second coffee chat scheduled for this week to keep learning more about the role and the day-to-day work.

Im just wondering if there is anything else I should be doing to avoid getting overlooked in the application process.

1kacgzq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kacgzq,Was Lynch’s Monica Bellucci dream in The Return inspired by The Sopranos?,"Watching The Test Dream from The Sopranos recently, and I couldn’t help but notice something weirdly specific.

In that 2004 episode, Tony has a long dream sequence where he meets his daughter’s boyfriend’s parents. During it, he turns to the mom and says, “You’re Annette Bening, right?” — and she agrees.

It’s literally the real-world actress Annette Bening showing up as herself inside Tony’s dream.

It instantly reminded me of The Return, where Gordon Cole describes his dream about drinking coffee with Monica Bellucci in Paris. Again, Monica plays herself — a real, actual celebrity appearing inside the character’s dream.

I know The Sopranos was heavily inspired by Twin Peaks early on, but this specific type of dream logic — pulling in real-world figures into a dream narrative — feels so similar that it made me wonder:

Was Lynch maybe taking a little inspiration back from David Chase this time?

Or was it just a parallel evolution from two guys obsessed with dream worlds?

Even the structure of some other events have some crossover.

Right after Tony talks to Annette, he notices Artie looking at him through a window, pointing urgently at something. Tony warns Annette that something bad is about to happen — very similar to the scene in The Return where Cooper meets the girl whose mother is banging on the door and how he needs to leave.

Maybe it’s just coincidence, but the similarities are kind of interesting.",8,1745890903.0,twinpeaks,4,0.72,False

1kacez0,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1kacez0/appreciation_as_a_path_to_enlightenment/,appreciation as a path to enlightenment.,"enlightenment is a big word. there's all kinds of ideas attached to it like the word god. both are empty by the nature of them being words. if being words aren't enough to demonstrate  their  emptiness then look at all the different meanings stuffed into them. you can only stuff something that's empty to begin with. or you can overcrowd it with a bunch of different things. people do this too. they overcrowd enlightenment and god with different ideas and so the two words become confusing.

how can anyone hope to find enlightenment or god when the words are either empty or confusing?

what about the word appreciation. how many meanings can that have? probably not as many as enlightenment or god. there's an immediate sense possible of what it means to appreciate anything. something can appreciate in value which means it increases in value. when somebody appreciates something they find value in it. there's a sense of comfort, contentment and even awe at the possibility of appreciation. 

so what if instead of searching for enlightenment or god attention is turned to appreciation? 

it doesn't have to be grand. it can go by unnoticed by most and kept a secret for the most part. appreciating the foam from toothpaste for instance. appreciating the wamth of coffee. appreciating the feeling of wind or sunshine, even clouds and the dullness of a rainy day in between drizzles. appreciating stop signs, the color and shape of it, the marvel of language to evoke behavior. stop.

appreciating all the small things. that's all. this may not lead to some supernatural discovery or an overwhelming sense of connectedness with everything, but for a moment–however long you choose–appreciation is within reach.

# Training

This was my fourth marathon, and one that I wasn't initially planning on until about mid-January. I'm a high school teacher and track coach with practices that go until 5:45pm every day. Sometimes I can get mileage in with the team, often I can't. Between practice, evening meets, and weekend meets, it can be hard to find the time for training. I had trained for Boston in 2023 while also coaching track and had a pretty sub-par build, and while my race then was fine, I left feeling like I left a lot on the table. I decided I wouldn't do another marathon during track season for a while, a claim that didn't even last two full seasons. I guess the allure of finally just going for it in my hometown race got the better of me.

I was training with a coach from May of last year through January of this year. I can't say a bad word about the training, as I got results. From fall 2024 through winter 2024 I PRed my 5K (16:08), 10k(33:01), and HM (1:10:54). Still, some life circumstances changed and I didn't have the spare money to justify the cost anymore, so I went solo after that half marathon in late January of '24.

To be honest, there wasn't much of an overarching philosophy to my training. If anything, my approach was rooted in a suspicion that people tend to overcomplicate these things, and my main goal during this block was informed by what I felt was lacking from my last two two marathons builds: I needed better, longer long runs. I would love to run 75-85 miles per week like some of my peers I race locally, I just don't reasonably have the time for that. Going back to the week of 2/10-2/16, my weekly mileage totals were 45/46/51/53/56/63/68/56/51 then cut down in the week before the race. The progression of my long runs went 14/16/18/20/21/19/22/20/18/16. Previous builds I had only done 1-3 runs of 20+, so getting more runs at 20 or above was a priority. Most of the LRs  this time involved a considerable proportion of the miles run at an honest effort (5:45-6:10). Most of the them were structured in as I would call warm up (3-5 easier), wind up(3-5 progression), honest effort, cool down. I was hesitant to identify a ""marathon pace"" as my previous marathon PR of 2:37:xx was somewhat out of line with my HM PR of 1:10:54, but I also didn't think I legit could get in shape to run a 2:30 full like my HM time ""predicted"".

Considering most of my long runs were workouts, I aimed to get one to two quality sessions per week. Most of the time I was really only able to get one. I think my school's midwinter and spring breaks were the only times I got two sessions in a week. Consistent with my suspicion that we tend to overcomplicate things, my workouts were really just aimed at two goals (1) making 5:45ish pace feel more comfortable and (2) getting used to running at that effort for an elongated period of time. I would switch between something like 1600-2k repeats with a short rest at 5:20-5:30 pace, 6-8 mile tempos around 5:50ish pace, and fartleks with 30+ minutes of total ""on"" timing. Occasionally, my workout for the week was just whatever effort I could get from doing parts of the workout with my track team. I'd do portions of the boys' reps as ""ons"" and jump in the girls' reps for what basically amounted to a float pace.

All in all, a typical week would include 6 days of running: 1 long run, 1 workout, 2-3 easier runs, and 1 typical run with 4-8 strides afterwards.

# Pre-race

Race started at 6:30am, so I knew it would be an early early morning. Banking on a night of mediocre sleep due to pre-race jitters, I went to bed extra early the night before the night before the race, getting a good 9+ hrs. The night before the race I got maybe 6-6.5 hrs, and woke up when my alarm went off at 4:30am. 2 cups of coffee and I got round one of good toilet time. Had some greek yogurt then a bagel+peanut butter, then it was off to the race. Managed to get one more session on the toilet to get everything cleared out. Warmed up by jogging around a few minutes but nothing in particular, I might have got a mile total. It was low 60s outside but with 95% humidity, so it didn't take long to get warm.

# Race

My last two marathons included something like a typical death march in the last 10k, where I ended up going 20-25 seconds per mile slower than I had previously run miles 1-20. I knew with the humidity that was going to be a very possible outcome if I didn't keep my composure for the first 18 or so. At halfway I was in 10th, but over the course of the next half I passed 5 guys who were falling prey to the weather or going for it a little too soon. Did I learn that lesson? Sort of, I think. I did feel like I was holding something back for a while, so I was surprised my miles kept rolling in the 5:40s or low 5:50s. There were times I felt I could've sped up, maybe I had more, but I kept thinking about the last 10k and how much I wanted to be able to finish this race with composure. I did have a miniature breakdown at miles 22-24. That stretch of the course was running due south into the wind with a gradual incline. It is also the portion of the course where the marathon rejoins with the half and therefore I had to do some dodging of slower half marathoners who couldn't stay on their side of the course. But was able to get my act together for the last two miles of the race.

For fueling, I tend to ere on the more conservative side. I had a maurten non-caf gel at miles 6 and 11, then maurten gels with caffeine at miles 16 and 21. While I might take less for fueling, I went more hardcore for hydration. Just wasn't gonna risk it. There were hydration stations every 1-1.5 miles, and I took something at almost every one. Most often I took the cup of powerade, took a drink, then took the cup of water, took a drink, and dumped the rest on my head.

I closed at about the same pace I started. I'll be honest it was hard to really send it in the last mile when my legs were shot and I knew I was about to run a big PR lol, but I tried! I crossed the line in 5th and might've yelled an expletive very loudly.

# Post-race

I did the post-marathon waddle through the finishing area. None of the post-race treats interested me. A very nice lady offered me ice cream to which I replied ""I couldn't possible keep that down."" There were some free beers for the runners but I actually quit drinking for this training block and honestly didn't feel like one. For what it's worth, I think cutting off booze was a game changer for me. I managed to nibble some food later that morning at breakfast but truthfully wasn't hungry until the evening. Soreness is worse today than right after the race, but I managed to get through the school day today!

1kaceoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1kaceoq/can_you_be_freinds_with_your_ex_that_you_are/,Can you be freinds with your ex that you are still madly in love with?…,"Hello everyone, I’d like some insight and opinions on my personal situation as I’m sure many of you have gone through this. 

     Me and my ex (god I hate even having to say that…) were together since Dec 4th of 2022. It was great. I couldn’t be happier I truly found my person and she felt the same. It was truth everything I had always hoped for given she was my first ever real relationship. With time things got shaky, she did emotionally cheat by continuing talking to someone that was obviously into her and seeked their attention. She told me given her last relarionships, where she was manipulated, taken advantage of, SA’d, coerced, isolated from freinds of family… just the crappiest people she could’ve dated… she did. That day I saw the conversation she stated that she had never felt true love before and was scared and it overwhelmed her. She believed it was too good to be true and that it was going to end eventually… so she thought, “why not end it myself before I could be hurt, betrayed or abandoned.” I forgave her and truly didn’t believe that she wanted to do what she did, but because she wasent used to being loved for her as a person rather than being taken advantage of, it was taboo to her. 

Moving forward things got better but I could tell alot of the unhealthy habits contracted from her past relationships did seem to now bleed into our relationships. Over stepping boundaries, not being emotionally available, having a hard time letting me in, and having trouble with communicating properly, especially when it came to having deep talk or genuine conversations about us or if I bring up something that hurt me or made me feel some type of way. And whenever I brought up an issue I was always soft spoken, always patient and ensured I wanted to resolve this as a team. 

Despite all this we were doing pretty good! She still made me feel special, that I was the only man she wanted to be with. Even though I knew I had someone who wasn’t use to this treatment before. Because of this I had to be extra precautions on how I go about things, give reassurance where needed, being more mindful of what I do. I didn’t mind it… I wanted to show her that she truly deserved to be loved just like anybody else even though she didn’t think so. 

In August of 2024, she distanced herself. Out of nowhere. She started pushing away. Giving me mixed signals/answers as to whether or not she still wanted us, if she wanted me… 
Going from “I’m in this with you, this is just a bump on the road.” To “I don’t know if a relationship is in the cards for me.” To “you are still my partner.” To “I’ve grown accustomed to being alone and on my own.” 

 In the end, I reassured her it’s okay to take time for herself and to do what she has to do for herself. In hopes she’ll come back to us. I supported her and cheered for her from afar. And still do. But the distance only grew, spending time with everyone else, making little to no time for us, avoiding questions in regards to us, and keeping things more surface level. There were days where she’d be more affectionate and loving but that started to disappear too. 

It got to a point where I simply felt like a freind. Sometimes even less. Like I was brought up when she needed me but put back on the shelf when I wasent needed anymore. 

On August 12th we spoke and she stated that she, after talking to her therapist and mom, stated that with their advice that she was not in the right headspace or place in life to pursue a relationship with me. 

Stating that her therapists suggested that we stay friends and have things ‘go with the flow’. Given that she felt she had too many battle within herself and things going on in her life that she couldn’t be fully present and give genuine time and energy for our relationship and that it would only be hurting me and making her feel more guilty. Her mother also agreed. 

I asked if “this was it?.” She stated that she didn’t want to lose me. She has been aware that she’s been hurting me and stated “I’ve been hurting the one person that I love and matters to me most and you don’t hurt people you love.” 

Stating that she knows she cannot continue in this relationship in a healthy manner but that she didn’t want to lose me in her life. Stating frustratingly “I don’t know what else to do, I know I cannot give you what you deserve right now, but I also don’t want to lose you, if possibly would you be able to stay in my life?” I asked, “In what way?” She iterated. “As Carmen stated, if we can be freinds for now.” 

I asked “ what do you mean for now?.” 
She states “I know myself best and right now I have a lot of things I need to work on myself and heal from. I’ve bled onto this relationship and have brought so many toxic things from my last relationship onto ours because I haven’t healed from them yet and I need to do that. And the only way I know how to do that is to do so on my own.” 

I ask “what is your plan?… if we stay friends. Because understand my feelings aren’t going to go away, understand what you are asking me right now. You’re asking me something that’s going to hurt like hell, to put my feelings away…”

She states “I know, and it’s going to hurt me so fucking bae too, but I don’t know if another way to be true to myself and what I feel I need right now but in also having the one person that matters most to be, to stay in my life… my plan is to heal and work on the things I’ve been working on with my therapist. I wish to seek another job, a career, go back to school, have a better relationship with my parents, to find my peace, and to be in a position in life where I’m content with myself and better off physically, mentally, emotionally and financially… and once I do, I would ask if you would like to give us another chance in the future?” 

I stated “I love you… so much. And if you need to go be in your own for a bit to be the best you… I’ll step away and let you do your thing… in the end I just want you to be happy and to thrive, even if it means without me.” 

She asks “will you still be in my life…”

I couldn’t answer, as it hurt too much. 

She asks again “will you please still be in my life, I don’t wish to lose you, but I know this decision takes two people.” 

In the end, I told her I’d try to give us being freinds a chance. And truthfully it hurts like hell. It dosent feel like much has changed since she distanced herself last August, the only thing that feels that has changed is there’s not official label anymore. We don’t talk as much, she makes time for her friends and family but not for us and I just feel like an after thought while I check up on her and text her Goodmorning and goodnight nearly every day and wish her a great day.

Something important to add as to why I was willing to give being freinds a try was that I expressed how much it would hurt to see her with another person. Because they would be taking the spot that was special only for me. 

She stated that her therapist stated if that was her reason to breakup, to live “young, wild and free.” Which I can assume you all know what that means. 

She stated that was the LAST thing on her mind and that she just wanted to go about life for now on her own terms given she has been in back to back toxic relationship (until she met me) from the age of 14 to 20 when she had met me. And felt that she never really had the time to truly be on her own. 

She expressed and reassured me that she did not want nor seeked anyone else that I was the man she truly wanted to be with. But, wanted to come back when she felt she was truly ready and wanting a relationship again, when she knows she can be the person she feels I deserve to have as my significant other.

I expressed that I couldn’t ask her to stay loyal to me and not seek anyone else as technically during a breakup you have the freedom to go seek who you wish. And I couldn’t do anything about it… and that was my biggest fear. She reassured me she does not want anybody else nor would she want to be in another relationship with anyone else. 

I told her that I would trust in her word. And that this promise is built and held upon trust in one another and faith in one another that we’ll go about our lives bettering ourselves to come back stronger than ever, our hearts only wanting each other… she agreed that’s what she wanted/wants too. 

We still share our locations and she states she respected me to still letting me know where she’s going and who she’s going with… but frankly it’s a hit or miss. Sometimes she tells me. Sometimes she dosent. And this last week she’s been more distant than usual. Going out with her friends of course and family. She’s working more now with her two jobs. But she hardly texts me lately and when she does it’s short and casual. Hasn’t really said Goodmorning or goodnight to me like I do. And frankly I know we’re won’t together anymore but I still go about life being loyal to her. I’m not seeking anyone nor do I want anybody else. Just staying occupied with my job, school, friends and my family. 
I’d think I’d be treated a little more “special” than her freinds but I’ve yet to see her or hangout with her and the few times I’ve asked to grab a coffee together or hangout or eat, she’s declined… 

She seems happier without me. It dosent feel to me that she misses me. But, then again I haven’t asked. It seems I’m the one missing her most. My heart yearns for everyday. And she seems okay and content with how things are. Part of me feels like I need to detach myself for her to truly miss me. But, then again, it don’t want to lose her…

affordable housing was discussed. 

I also introduced myself as the moderator for this subreddit. The mayor remembered me from my earlier email inviting him and City council to this subreddit. they seem warm and welcoming to the idea of utilizing this space as another means of interfacing with the public. 

I had brought up a previously stated concern of who people should contact about starting activities at the community center. there is a director of that who should handle those sorts of things, and I was told that she is very responsive. her name escapes me, of course. 

however, it was mentioned that contacting the city manager is a great starting place for finding out who to contact about what, sort of like the desk sergeant at a police headquarters.

I am managed to get two business cards, with should be pictured in this post. 

as there were only two civilians, myself included, the meeting was short. 

everybody was very approachable and appeared happy to serve. they are making effort to keep themselves open to the public, and I think they mentioned wanting to have more of these types of meetings in the future.

Pure gold 😂,"Once upon a time, in a land filled with backlogs, C&P exams, and mysterious status screens, there was a veteran — a true warrior, not just in service to their country, but now battling the mighty VA system.

The veteran had fought a long and tireless campaign: gathering DBQs, writing personal statements laced with perfect 38 CFR references, and submitting supplemental claims so precisely crafted they could make a rater weep tears of joy.

One fateful morning — after what felt like an eternity of checking ""step 3... step 3... step 3..."" — the veteran awoke, grabbed a coffee, and refreshed the VA site out of habit.

Boom.

Step 5: Preparation for Decision.

The veteran blinked twice. Rubbed their eyes. Was it real? It was. Their claim had broken free from the purgatory of evidence gathering!

But it didn’t stop there.

Like a divine intervention, the veteran’s file landed on the desk of Senior RVSR Johnson, known around the regional office as the ""One-Touch Queen"" — a legendary figure who prided herself on knocking out decisions in a single sitting. She took one look at the veteran’s evidence — the clean DBQs, the ironclad nexus letters, the beautifully worded statements — and said:

> ""Why hasn’t this hero been rated already?!""



With furious typing (and maybe a slight smile), she rated each condition favorably. Migraines? 50%. Sinusitis? 30%. Radiculopathy? 20% each extremity. Back and neck? 40%. GERD increased to 30%. Anxiety finally recognized at 70%.

She hit ""Submit"" with a flourish.

That same afternoon, the veteran got a notification:

“Your VA claim has been decided.”

Their heart raced. They logged in — and there it was.

100% Permanent and Total.

Not temporary. No future exams scheduled. Lifetime benefits secured. Full backpay calculated from the original intent to file — a jaw-dropping amount. Even Chapter 35 education benefits activated automatically for their family.

Then came the letters: one from the VA congratulating them, another offering eligibility for VA dental, commissary privileges, and even a letter from a local VSO asking if they’d like to join them for a celebration dinner.

The veteran sat back, feeling — for the first time in a long time — completely at peace. The fight was over. The VA dragon had been slain. And in the battle of bureaucracy, the veteran emerged not just victorious, but legendary.

They smiled, raised their coffee mug high, and whispered to themselves:

1kacczl,https://i.redd.it/rbi264mzgoxe1.jpeg,"Read the labels! Daniel’s Coffee, “Stevia” Daw, Pero Sugar Bomb Pala?","Ang Daniel’s Brown Coffee 3-in-1, na madalas inirerekomenda sa mga miyembro ng MCGI, ay inilalako bilang “healthier choice” dahil daw sa stevia.
Pero pag binusisi ang ingredients, ibang istorya ang lumalabas.

Sa label pa lang, makikita ang mga pangunahing sangkap:

Brown sugar (una sa listahan ibig sabihin, pinakamarami)

Non-dairy creamer (na may glucose syrup at hydrogenated oils)

Coffee powder

Stevia extract powder (huling-huli sa listahan — konting-konti)

Kung titignan ang formulation, pixie-dusting lang ang nangyari isang term sa industriya ng food marketing kung saan ginagamit ang pangalan ng isang healthy ingredient (gaya ng stevia), pero halos trace amount lang talaga ang laman para maka-advertise lang as “with Stevia”.

SCIENTIFIC SIDE

Brown sugar overload, nagdudulot
high glycemic index, mabilis magpataas ng blood sugar.

Glucose syrup, purong fast-absorbing glucose, mas matindi pa ang insulin spike.

Stevia, nandyan nga, pero dahil napakaliit ng amount at natabunan ng real sugars, wala halos effect sa glycemic impact.

Sa madaling salita, marketed as “with stevia”, pero 90%+ ng tamis ay galing pa rin sa regular sugars.

HEALTH RISKS INVOLVED

Kung regular na iniinom,

Frequent insulin spikes na naglalagay sa risk ng insulin resistance at diabetes.

Chronic inflammation dahil sa processed oils at sugars.

Oxidative stress na sanhi ng mabilis na pagtanda at cellular damage.

Hindi ito aligned sa sinasabing “pangangalaga sa kalusugan” na tinuturo dapat sa isang faith-based community.

Pagtaas ng timbang kahit mag diet ka pa.

Pamamaga ng mukha especially sa bandang pisngi at eyebags dahil sa inflammation.

CAPTIVE MARKET CONCERN

Sa MCGI setup, maraming kapatid ang pinipilit bumili ng Daniel’s Coffee, hindi lang dahil sa personal choice, kundi bilang bahagi ng internal fundraising at “pag-suporta” sa sariling produkto ng grupo.

ANG TANONG

Karapatan ba ng isang samahan na gamitin ang tiwala ng miyembro para itulak ang produkto na pwedeng makasama sa kalusugan nila?

Hindi na ito simpleng “preference.”
Ito ay ethics — tungkol sa responsibilidad ng leadership sa kapakanan ng mga miyembro.

Hindi sapat na may stevia label para sabihing “healthy.”

Hindi rin sapat na “internal product” ito para mabulag na lang tayo sa ingredients.

Kung ang tunay na layunin ay kalusugan at kabutihan, dapat transparent at totoo ang produkto — hindi sugar-laden drinks disguised with a sprinkle of stevia.

Dapat bang pag-isipan ng mga miyembro ang pag-challenge sa ganitong produkto?

Paano natin mababantayan ang sarili nating kalusugan kahit sa loob ng isang organisasyon?

Ang Daniel’s Coffee ay hindi simpleng “coffee with stevia.” Isa itong sugar-loaded drink na nakabalatkayo sa marketing buzzword.

At kung tunay nating iniingatan ang ating katawan kailangan nating maging mas mapanuri, kahit pa ito ay nagmumula sa sarili nating samahan.",2,1745890556.0,MCGIExiters,2,1.0,False

Anyway….

So this is kinda weird but here we go…

I (31F) had a baby 10 weeks ago. One morning, just for laughs, I squirted a bit of breastmilk into my partner’s (38M) coffee. We both cracked up — and then he drank it, looked me dead in the eye, and said it was the best coffee he’d ever had.

And so, the era of the “Titty Latte” was born.

Since then, every single morning without fail, he’s asked for his daily Titty Latte like he’s ordering from some boutique hipster café. It was funny at first, but now it’s getting a little… out of hand. I’m exclusively breastfeeding our baby, and every drop of milk really counts. I just don’t have the supply to keep making boutique boob coffees and feed our actual child.

I told him I can’t keep giving him Titty Lattes, and while he’s not angry, he’s genuinely devastated. Now every morning he drinks his boring regular coffee with big sad puppy eyes, dramatically sighing about how it “tastes like dishwater and broken dreams.”

I feel a bit bad because it did become a weird little bonding ritual for us (parenthood makes you weird, I swear), but at the same time — our baby needs it way more than his taste buds do.

So… AITA for cutting off his Titty Latte supply to prioritize feeding our baby?
(Also, I cannot believe this is my real life. Send help.)

(Yes, I know how weird this sounds. No, he’s not weird otherwise. Just very, very enthusiastic about his coffee.)",351,1745890375.0,TwoHotTakes,137,0.87,False
1kacaj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/singing/comments/1kacaj2/what_technique_did_i_learn/,What technique did I learn?,"In  1998-99, I spent a year taking semi-private (2-3 person classes) with an opera teacher who claimed to be teaching Bel Canto. He also claimed that his approach to singing would bring about immense personal transformation and enable his students to express their inner essence through their voices. Of course this was  Hollywood, and  he was a bit of a con man. After a few months, several of his students did some research and guessed he was maybe teaching some variation of a technique for Wagnerian opera (we weren’t  sure).

Even though he was lying when he marketed his lessons as bel canto, he seems to have been teaching a legitimate technique from somewhere. This teacher did have advanced students who performed in actual operas. I’ve also seen reviews of his work from the days when he used to sing in operas himself. Actors and singers with  professional credits seemed to know about the technique that he taught.  When we said we weren’t supposed to sing outside of class for the first couple of years we were with this teacher, they nodded and said they knew about this approach. It apparently was sometimes used to heal damaged voices. 

 He would instruct his students to take turns pulling their larynx down as far as it would go and “scream bloody murder,” and we would wail out an extended “a” or an “i.” You could feel the vibration all through your body and up into your skull. He would signal to us when we sounded right and ask us to notice how that felt because the sound was focused several yards in front of us and we what we heard wasn’t what we sounded like to an audience—we were supposed to feel, not hear, when our voices resonated correctly. In the lessons I had over the year and a half I studied with him, he seldom had anyone do anything other than long, extended single notes up and down the scale, but I heard other students’ voices transform into something like a bell ringing inside the notes of a violin as they bellowed those extended vowels. I went from barely being able to project beyond a whisper or even resonate to being able to do both well enough to sing and play my guitar in coffee houses and at other small shows even though I don’t consciously use what he taught.

I’m curious to know what his technique was and whether there are teachers who include it in other styles of singing. 

To recap (the tl;dnr):

Lessons consisted of wailing out long “a” and “i” notes while pulling our larynx down with a “power yawn” and “swallowing our throats.” 

We were supposed to learn to recognize what we felt when the teacher signaled we’d gotten the sound right because our voices were focused far in front of us and we couldn’t rely on what we sounded like to ourselves.

We weren’t supposed to sing outside of class because singing the way we used to would interfere with mastering his technique.

The technique was sometimes used to repair damaged voices.

And when he signaled to students that they’d gotten it, they really did sound amazing.

Does anyone have any idea what technique I partially learned?",3,1745890341.0,singing,1,1.0,False

1kac4i0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartShoppingHub/comments/1kac4i0/searching_for_a_nonsmelly_thermos_best_material/,Searching for a Non-Smelly Thermos: Best Material Choices and Brand Recommendations,"When selecting a thermos, few things are more disappointing than encountering an unpleasant odor after just a single use. The user’s recent experience, where a £15 Costa heat flask developed an unbearable smell immediately, reflects a common frustration. Many consumers seek a reliable thermos not primarily for its heat retention, but for its ability to remain neutral in scent and taste over time. Understanding the root cause of these odors, and knowing which materials and brands prioritize customer satisfaction and quality, can make all the difference.

The unpleasant smell often results from the materials used in the manufacturing process or inadequate post-production cleaning. Lower-end stainless steel, plastic linings, or poor-quality seals can emit chemical smells once they interact with hot liquids, especially coffee, tea, or acidic beverages. Even high-quality thermoses can initially carry a slight factory scent from lubricants or preservatives applied during production. However, reputable brands invest in material purity, thorough cleaning protocols, and design innovations that minimize or eliminate such issues.

For consumers prioritizing a neutral smell over heat retention, material choice becomes critically important. Stainless steel thermoses made from high-grade 18/8 (also known as 304-grade) stainless steel tend to perform best. This material is resistant to corrosion and flavor transfer, making it an ideal choice for anyone sensitive to odors. Importantly, high-quality stainless steel does not require plastic liners, which are often the primary culprits for retaining and releasing unwanted smells. Double-wall construction, properly treated interiors, and BPA-free components also contribute to maintaining freshness inside the flask.

Given these requirements, selecting a trusted brand is equally important. Companies such as Zojirushi, Stanley, Thermos (the brand itself), and Klean Kanteen have longstanding reputations for producing thermoses that maintain neutral smells over time. Zojirushi, for instance, uses a superior stainless steel construction combined with an electro-polished interior, which reduces microscopic nooks where smells and residues can cling. Klean Kanteen is another standout, offering products made with food-grade stainless steel that feature minimalistic, easy-to-clean designs, free from complex lids that can harbor odors.

Before using any new thermos, it is advisable to perform an initial deep cleaning to eliminate any residual factory smells. Washing the thermos with a solution of baking soda and vinegar, followed by a thorough rinse with hot water, often removes any lingering odors. Letting the thermos air out with the lid off after cleaning also helps to ensure that no smells are trapped inside. If a flask continues to emit odors after such treatments, it is generally a sign of inferior materials or manufacturing defects, and replacement should be considered.

Ultimately, to avoid the frustration of purchasing another disappointing product, consumers should research carefully, prioritize build quality and material safety, and select brands with a proven commitment to customer satisfaction. Investing slightly more in a thermos from a reputable company is likely to save money and frustration in the long term, providing a clean, odor-free experience for years to come.

Landed a job a month ago as a relief/reserve/flex officer covering 2 corporate sites which has gone very well so far - colleagues/client are cool, no issues there, job itself I'm happy with and learned a lot already. Already bagged 20 shifts the first month so first payday will be tasty. 

Only on one occasion was I called to cover sickness (I'd done a stretch of 7pm-7am nights, 1 day off, went to sleep at 3am, got called to cover at 5am - arrived for 7am. I was exhausted but managed.)
I'm on my 3rd day off, turned my phone off since Monday because I needed a break/life admin, but should've told management I'm unavailable to cover - maybe my boss tried to call, as I got a text from him to call before 20:00 but replied 10 minutes after - asked me to call him in the morning. I asked a coworker/colleague if anything was up - he needs me to cover his 5pm-7am shift Wednesday which I've agreed to. He's new to the company too, and apparently our boss wants us to ""keep our phones on"", so I can expect more calls when I'm asleep/barely slept to cover, which I know I signed up for, but it fucking sucks serious horse dick.
But the boss is a good guy, an experienced veteran, and always prepares shifts a month in advance, so hopefully call outs won't be frequent. In future I'll let them know my availability and that's that - if they don't like it, eat a dick. 

So at the second site (1 man site), the day guy does 7am-5pm mon-fri, nights does 5pm-7am. Days are far busier, nights are generally chilled. My boss has hinted he wants me doing 14 hour nights permanently (I think the most would be 5 in a row), but shit, that's still insane. My journey home is like 30-40 minutes, realistically I'll get 5-6 hours max sleep before work. 12 hour shifts already kill me, so I have no idea if I can handle consistent 14's. I'm not one to sleep on the job either no matter how exhausted - coffee/energy drinks and good food to power through, and taking even a short nap would get me fired anyway (cameras).

How the fuck do you guys deal with working the long hours, often with minimal notice/call outs, but still function and remain alert? Does your body/brain just get used to it? ",1,1745889022.0,securityguards,4,1.0,False

In passing we were friendly in school and she became the gf to an old friend at that time. Fast forward couple years we reconnected and instantly became close. 

She is on dating apps and constantly going on dates and meeting guys but always finds something “icky.” This never bothered me because everyone deserves to have their preference. Though, she began to talk to her ex boyfriend from Highschool and I made it clear to her that he was a dad of 4 kids and was having a nasty custody battle and stay away. I knew this because he flat out told her and I was friends with him and the 2 baby mothers until I distanced when I began to date my now husband. She still went on to meet with him and then feelings came up for her and he was obviously unavailable. She mourned and cried and I helped her through it. 

Then, one day we went out for coffee and I saw another Highschool friend (a guy) from my math class. I said hello and he congratulated me on my wedding and we caught up while my friend was there. I quickly notice that he was super interested in her and I kind of giggled while they both talked and I decided to go home to let them be. They went out and suddenly she found it “icky” that he was 27 year old virgin and dumped him. I told her that she shouldn’t judge him. Then she met another guy and dated him but then cheated on him hoping he would find out so breaking up would be easier but eventually dumped him because she found him “icky.” Afterwards, she was speed dating and meeting men and I began to get concerned and told her to hold off on dating because she was hitting lots of road blocks that were making her feel heartbroken. She agreed and suddenly she came to my bday party and my husband thoughtfully hosted everything and when he read a speech to me infront of my family, my friend began to cry. I saw it as a wholesome friend wishing me the best. 

My family all said they saw jealousy. 

I didn’t like to think that way of her because after all, she has been a good friend to me and her personal dating life although, questionable…it didn’t affect me. However, after the party she re-opened her dating apps and went on to date another guy the next day! He was from my country (I won’t say). For context they typically look for white women for papers and I told her that I was happy for her but for her sake to make sure she knew his intentions. Long story short…he asked her to get married so could get papers and when she said no…he left her. She became very obsessed stalking him and wondering why things transpired the way it did and getting very angry. When she found out he was dating another girl 4 days later, she lost it. She got to the point where she would know when he would block and unblock her on socials, who the girl was and driving by his house. I brought it to her attention to stop doing this to avoid trouble. 

In February, I went to a dinner with my parents Neighbor and it was a lady and her son (30M). Her son had invited us to his mom’s bday dinner and suddenly my husband and I chuckled thinking the “what if” my friend dated this guy because he seemed decent. We laughed but kept it between us.

Fast forward, a couple months later in a conversation I told my friend about that dinner and she instantly wanted to know how he looked like. I showed her his profile (I didn’t have him on socials) and she pressed follow. I got upset because I didn’t feel comfortable having her follow him when I’m married (this is my personal preference and nothing to do with my husband controlling me). I spoke with my husband and he was understanding and said “hey, don’t worry I know you are just wanting the best for your bestie and u r playing Cupid, to make it less weird I’ll add him as well.” 

Suddenly, she began to ask tons of questions about him and even wanted to follow him. I suggested that she not do that because I didn’t want things to go south and it affecting my family friendship with my parents neighbours. Regardless, she did it behind my back. 

He then messaged her and I did feel excited for her and even told her that it would be nice if we double date and she said the texting was getting pretty flirty. The following day she came to my family bbq and my parents invited our neighbours. But it was only the mom who came. When I saw my friend come out the car she was wearing a long skirt and white tank top showing her nipples and belly ring. 

I felt odd that she would wear that to my family bbq and I hope to not sound rude but I got a little upset. But where it got weird was when she saw the mom of my Neighbor and I told her who she was…she asked me to come with her to her car. She immediately put a sweater on and said she felt that she was showing off too much nipple and skin and doesn’t want to make a bad impression on this guy’s mom. I laughed and told her it’s fine. But in my mind I thought why would she choose to wear it at my family bbq and then feel off when she saw the mom. That became a red flag for me. 

Then I end up finding out through my sister that the neighbour came a couple weeks back to my mom saying her son is expecting a baby with his gf. I freaked out and told my sister that this guy was messaging my friend to go on a date. I immediately told my friend he is taken and my sister asked I not share the pregnancy detail because the mother told my sister and mom with the expectation that no one else would know. So I decided to omit that information. 

I thought things were clear when I told her and she thanked me for letting her know. Although, she sent me a screenshot saying he declared he was single. I pressed her and told her to trust me that he wasn’t single and he was lying and she still went on to tell me she wanted to see where things go. I told her that his mom has already shared he is with a gf and even with that she said she wants to see where things go and try to press the answer out of him but entertain things. I immediately got upset.

I’m starting to feel uncomfortable and all afternoon I been overthinking. I’m wondering if this is a friend I need to cut out or keep away from my family. I feel like she is selfish the way she doesn’t care. My family has been telling me that they don’t like her and that she was dressed inappropriately and they felt uncomfortable she would wear that when my husband was there, brother, nephews and my sister’s bf and my dad were there.

I’m not sure if I’m being naive but they even went as far as to say they think she would even try to get with my husband. 

I’m not sure how to navigate this and I really want to tread carefully.

I remember the first time I had a panic attack, I came to him because I wanted comfort but he just sat across from me and pretty much went down a list of ""have you taken any drugs, did you have caffeine, do you feel like you're having a heart attack"" while I was just crying and begging him to comfort me because I was upset. Some years down the line when I was very much going through the shitty teenager phase of 15ish I had a lot of problems with authority and he is very much a ""you need to show respect and not question adult figures in your life"" and he had a pretty short fuse when I would challenge him in that aspect. A couple of times it resulted in him grabbing the back of my neck and pushing me into the floor. This only happened about 4-5 times but it was extremely insulting and really hurt something in me, it felt like I was being treated like a dog. Around this time I went into therapy and briefly mentioned one of these situations which of course landed CPS at our front door which was not my intention. We got cleared and nothing happened but for at least a month afterwards my dad wouldn't talk to or even look at me. I remember being so mad that he hadn't gotten any ""punishment"" but it's not like I wanted him to go to jail or anything. I just wanted him to apologize to me. Years down the line we're kind of okay, after I turned 18 he became a lot more lax about me smoking or having a drink every now and then without telling my mom. He's a very sarcastic person and definitely enjoys pushing people's buttons, but at the same time he is pretty OCD. I've tried to have several conversations with him about wanting to feel less distant from him even though I see him almost everyday but he just shuts it down or makes it some joke. When I try to hug him or say I love you he makes a spectacle of it like ""aww you want a hug? Awww hahaha"" which makes me not want to do it. But I still crave his emotional support and connection. The other day I was in the car with my family and I guess I was filling them in a lot about my life and my dad made some snarky toned remark ""oh you've had coffee that's why you're talking so much"" and I stopped and tried to express that saying that was a bit rude and made me a bit upset. I wasn't trying to make it some big thing, I just wanted him to hear me out and not do that. This was met with ""oh sorry did I offend you"" and he was not taking me seriously in the slightest. When we got home I went to him and tried to re-express how he had hurt my feelings and that I just wanted to let him know so in the future it doesn't happen again. ""I got it. Less communication from me is better"" is what he said. That was not at all what I was saying to him. And I said that. I sent him a text later because I started crying and needed to walk away. I'm gonna add a screenshot of the text but it's been a day and he hasn't responded or even acknowledged in person that anything happened. I don't know how to confront this anymore because it is exhausting trying again and again and being met with zero effort on his part. Any suggestions lol?",1,1745888873.0,AskDad,2,1.0,False

Every time I add a design to my cart, they automatically add “the starbucks coffee company” to the cart, and I can’t get rid of it. So I’m wondering if I’m only allowed to pick 1 design on my own, and the other one is just mandatory to have it? ",2,1745888657.0,starbucks,2,1.0,False
