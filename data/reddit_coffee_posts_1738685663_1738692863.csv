I am in the process of redesigning our living room, which is a small space. We are planning on keeping the existing couch and coffee table, but want to replace everything else. 

The two chairs in the mockup were ordered this week. The swivel chair isn't as white as it appears (nomad snow crypton fabric), and I would say the lounge chair is less vibrant in person (lush moss crypton fabric).

The green chair will be positioned on the left side of the TV, and the offwhite swivel chair will be on the right side. We will clear out that right side entirely, and get rid of the pew.

We want earthy tones (dark green, clay, dark gray, offwhite). However, I struggle with pulling everything together using the rug and pillows. I do web design for work, which is very different from interior design, I've found.

The pillow arrangement on the couch is my first attempt incorporating the velvet used on the chair, different textures, and patterns. I feels a little too ""matchy"", so I was hoping to get some ideas from the community. I'm absolutely not attached to the rug or pillows. The chair fabrics are locked in, and we can have custom pillows made, utilizing those fabrics, if that is desirable.

You can probably tell we're going with a mid century modern vibe, and want our rug and pillows to reflect that. May be worth mentioning that there will be some greenery added from plants.",1,1738692619.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

I have no partner, but I feel like I am ready to have kids. My friend, P, had her first child delivered by stork and invited me to a Mommy’s group in the park. She told me over coffee before we joined the group that one of the moms-to-be, Dee (F, 35), is a bit of a snob, and she isn’t sure if her 20 year old boyfriend or her 35 year old ex-husband is the father of her baby. The guys don’t really know each other but if she calls one of them, they will drop everything and run to help her. She told both of them they are the dad. 

At the moms group, Dee was telling everyone to like her social posts and how she and her ex wanted to do some baby shopping. When the attention was turned to me, I was telling them my baby should be arriving by stork really soon. Everyone was excited for me, except Dee because the attention was off of her. She loudly muttered that a stork baby isn’t real motherhood. P is the only other person who has a stork baby, so we kind of looked at each other, and I could see the tears in her eyes. I said, “Excuse me?” She stares at me and says, “You aren’t a real mom until you spend the nine days carrying your child!” I looked at her and said, “Well, at least I didn’t have to troll the high school to find my baby daddy.” She turned a little pale and ran to the restroom, and I am still not sure if it is because of what I said or because she had morning sick, because I left the group.

P called me later and was really happy I defended mothers who had their babies brought by stork. She said the group was divided on my reaction, because Dee is known to be an attention hog so a lot of them thought she was the llama, but I probably went too far to throw her younger boyfriend in her face, especially because the baby could be the ex’s, so I was a llama, too.

It’s to my understanding that he doesn’t have a lot of friends, so he’s kind of latching onto me and it’s bothering me. I was expecting for us to have a work friendship, but now he’s trying to hang out multiple times a week and text frequently. 

My time is very limited right now, I’m just about to graduate college and I don’t even have enough time to go out with my own friends during the week. I feel like I took it a step too far myself because I was being really nice to him and kind of leading on a friendship that I didn’t want, but I also felt like I was just being respectful and normal, like how people usually are. 

anyway, I feel like I owe him a friendship now even though I’m just really overwhelmed by the whole situation and don’t want to be involved at all anymore. I don’t think we’d be great friends either just because of our own personal interests.

I close my eyes and let my fingertips feel the softness of the fur of this furbaby. The eyes twinkled with glee and looked at me with so much hope that i couldn't help myself but give in to this enjoyable torture. This cuddliest little kitten. A manipulative fur-coated being. 
Love is just amazing. So beautiful and surreal. And one thing i have learned in these 24 years of my existence that love has no voice - it's seen and felt in it's own beautifully intricate way. Just the way this adorable little baby is giving me a little glimpse of it by rolling in dirt and demanding much-needed belly rubs. Gosh! I can do anything to see her happy. 

The cold wind nips my skin in a good way and the Cresent moon is out in its glory with gray hue of smog acting as a delicate veil. It always astonishes me how easy and equally tough it is to carry an emotion so strong that could brighten someone's life. Imagine somebody - be it an animal or a human - getting their colours back because of you and solely you. I have read about endless drugs, drug trials, remedies and therapies but by the end, it's just love that conquers all. And you know what the best part is - it has it's fragile streaks of hope intertwined within - hope to experience the same one fine day, hope to be treated the same way, hope to allow it to ourselves. It's just so indescribably beautiful. 

But beware, with the purest of the intentions comes the being/s with the most malicious intent for perhaps they are deprived or greedy to bask in rarest of the sunshine and get a whiff of it and indeed, love and other drugs are rare and pure but they are not to squander. It's precious, it's an addicting mix of tranquility and bliss. It's a perfect blend of rain and a warm mug of coffee. It's an equisite taste of sweetness with a hint of spice. And above everything, it's what conquers all.

Not looking to get chastised here - I know this isn't enough time on the Big Island. We hope to be back and spend more time, but we can't afford the time this go around.

- We would be coming in from Maui. 
- The main attraction for us on the BI is the Volcanoes. It's a bucket list item for us.
- Trip is in October.
- Healthy and young, and with a ~18 month old. We can hike but nothing extreme due to the baby. 
- We won't be able to swim or snorkel (but love the beach), or drink (so bars and such aren't an interest).
- We aren't huge foodies but would love to try some local, family friendly gems you may recommend.
- We are used to a lot of driving and it isn't the worst thing in the world for us. We typically do a lot of ""the journey is the destination"" road trips on the mainland. 
- Time frames are all +/- and estimates. 
- We run-and-gun and aren't the type to sit in the same place all day or sit with our feet up. We like moving between different things and seeing a lot.

**Day 1:**
- Flight lands around noon ish, KOA side. Pick up rental car. Have lunch in Kona. 
- Stop by Kaloko-Honokohau National Historic Park.
- Check in to resort around 4pm to refresh for a bit and get the little guy situated.
- Kahalu'u Beach Park for sunset. 
- Go back to resort. 

**Day 2:**
- Leave as early as we can, I'm thinking by 8AM-ish is realistic for us but maybe earlier due to time zone difference depending on if we have or haven't adjusted. Drive to Volcanoes National Park.
- Spend all day at Volcanoes, driving through and doing some of the doable hikes for our situation.
- Return to the resort at dark. 

**Day 3:**
- Leave the resort in the morning, grab breakfast somewhere on the way and drive up to Waipi'o Valley (I see it looks like it's closed now, this would be assuming it's open by then).
- Midmorning to early afternoon at Waipi'o Valley. Mainly viewpoints and short hike.
- Drive to Akaka Falls State Park. Spend the afternoon at the park hiking to the falls.  
- Drive our way back towards the Kona side in the later afternoon / early evening, exploring our way back. 
- Spend the evening to sunset at a beach somewhere. 
- Get to hotel. 

**Day 4:**
- Spend the day at nearby beaches, a coffee farm tour (recommendations on which one?), maybe a honey farm tour (recommend?), and check out the Costco. Sounds like they'll have some local / unique stuff to possibly take home.
- Head to the airport around 530-6PM to check in for the flight back home. ",0,1738691758.0,VisitingHawaii,5,0.5,False

anything to very much avoid? I used to eat grass fed beef 3x a week but now I’m a little worried about red meat. 

Lastly!! Very important question. I don’t drink often maybe once a month. Am I able to drink on occasion like an upcoming wedding, Valentine’s Day? Or should I just completely avoid alcohol at all costs?

It's a five-minute drive. And then she comes back home to finish getting herself ready for the day before she has to be to work at 9:00 (five minute drive to her work). Today, though, she had to go to work early so she would be leaving to go to work and dropping the kids off at school at the same time (she works at the school). But she wanted to go get coffee on her way to work/school. The coffee place is two minutes from both her work/kids' school and it's on the way.

My commute to work is 40 minutes so I typically leave at 7:15 - I don't take the kids to school because of this. Today, though, I have an eye appointment in the morning at 9:00 so I'm hanging out at home until 8:40. She asked if I could take the kids to school so she could go get coffee, and I told her no.

My rationale is that I'd be going out of my way to take the kids to school when it's literally on the way for her.  I don't have a reason to leave that early and I'd have to come back home and wait around until I leave for my eye appointment anyways. To me, it makes no sense for me to take them when she's already heading that way. Again, coffee is on the way to her work/their school and it's two minutes away.

I don't have a problem getting her coffee; I do it when I come back from the gym on the weekends sometimes because it's on my way from the gym/to home so it makes sense.

Edit: To add, on days when I have off and they have school/she has work, I volunteer to take the kids so she doesn't have to go drop kids off and come back home to get ready. So it's less about coffee and more about what's practical in my eyes.",1,1738691686.0,AITAH,20,0.57,False

Before I start, I’d like to be as transparent as possible.

Twenty years ago, I was convicted of manslaughter. 

Framed by an organization that took my need and my vulnerability and twisted it to their own ends.

I can’t right my wrongs, and I know that. I’ll live with the consequences of trusting them for the rest of my life. 

Now that I’m free, though, I've finally decided to put the truth of what happened to me out into the world, which boils down to this:

The organization implanted something that allowed me to hear sounds that are normally well out of reach from our perception. Sounds that the human mind wasn’t designed to withstand - an imperceptible cacophony that is occurring all around you as you read this, you just don't know it. It’s occurring around me as I write this as well, and although I can’t physically hear it, I can still *feel* it. It's faint, but I know it's there. 

And once I came to understand what they did, they made sure to silence me. 

\------------------

***11/01/02 - Ten days before the incident.*** 

*“Ready?”*

I nodded, which was only kind of a lie. I was *always* ready for this part of my week to be over, but I was never quite ready for the god-awful sensation.

Hewitt clicked the remote, and the implant in my left temple whirred to life. It always started gently. A quiet buzzing. Irritating, but only mildly so. Inevitably, however, the sound and the vibration crescendoed. What started as a soft hum grew into a furious droning, like a cicada vibrating angry verses from the inside of my skull.

I gritted my teeth and closed my eyes tight.

*Only a few more seconds.*

Finally, when I could barely tolerate it anymore, a climatic shockwave radiated from the device, causing my jaw to clack from the force. With the reverberation dissipating as it moved further down my body, the device stilled.

A sigh of relief spilled from my lips.

I opened my eyes and saw green light reflecting off of Hewitt’s thick glasses from the implant’s remote. In layman’s terms, I’d learned that meant “all good”.

Hewitt smiled, creasing his weathered cheeks.

*“The implant is primed. Let me collect my materials so we can get this show on the road.”*

The stout Italian physician shot up from his desk chair and turned to face the wooden cabinets that lined the back of his office. Despite his advanced age and bulky frame, he was still remarkably spry.

*“Thanks. By the way, I don’t think I’ll ever be ‘ready’ for that, Doc. For any of this, actually. You can probably stop asking. Save your breath, I mean.”*

As I spoke, it felt like heavy grains of sand were swimming around my molars. I swished the pebbles onto my tongue and spat them into my hand, frowning at the chalky crystals in my palm.

*“Jesus. Cracked another filling. Does the Audiology department have a P.O. box I can forward my dental bills to?”*

He chuckled weakly as he turned back towards me. The old doctor was only half-listening, now preoccupied with assembling the familiar experimental set up. Carefully, he placed a Buddha statue, a spray bottle of clear liquid, four half-foot tall metal pillars, and a capped petri dish on the desk.

Absentmindedly, I rubbed the scar above my temple. Most of the time, I just pretended like I could perceive the outline of the dime-sized implant. The delusion helped me feel in control.

But I wasn’t in control. Not completely, at least. 

I shared control with the remote in Hewitt’s hand, especially when *his* part of the implant was active. The experimental portion. Suppressing the existential anxiety that came with split dominance was challenging. I wasn’t used to my sensations being a democracy.

The concession felt worth it, though. The implant restored my hearing, and Hewitt installed it free, with a single string attached: I had to play ball with these weekly sessions, testing the part of the implant that I wasn’t allowed to know anything about, per our agreement.

On the desk, the doctor was arranging the metal pillars into a small square. Once satisfied with the dimensions of the square, he’d position the statue, the spray bottle, and the petri dish into the center of it. Then, testing would finally begin.

*“So…are your other patients tolerating this thing okay?”* I asked, fishing for a few reassuring words.

The doctor looked up from his designs, pointing a brown iris and a bushy white eyebrow at me.

*“There are no other patients like you, David.”*

He paused for a moment, maintaining unbroken eye contact, as if to highlight the importance of what just came out of his mouth. Abruptly, he severed his gaze and resumed fidgeting with the metal pillars, but he continued to talk.

*“Your case, this situation, its…unique. A marriage of circumstances. When the brain infection took your hearing, any model of cochlear implant could have been used to repair it. But you couldn’t afford them, not even the cheapest one. At the exact same time, my lab was looking for an elegant solution to our own problem. A friend of a friend was aware of both of our dilemmas. You needed an implant for free, and we needed a…”*

He stopped talking mid-sentence and swiveled his head around the setup, examining it from different angles and elevations, but he made no further modifications. It seemed like everything was in its right place. Contented, he sat back down in his chair, and briefly, Hewitt was motionless. He looked either lost in his thoughts, captivated by things he’d rather not say out loud, or he was resting and not thinking about anything at all.

Either way, it took a moment for him to remember he had been explaining something to me. My confused facial expression probably sped that process along.

*“Right. We needed a…”* he trailed off, wringing his hand to convey he was searching for the correct word in English.

*“We needed an ‘operator’. Someone to tell us that the device worked like we had designed it to. I wouldn’t say this was an elegant solution, but we’re both getting something out of the deal, I suppose.”*

In the nine months since the implantation, this was by far the most Hewitt ever divulged about the deeper contents of their arrangement.

As requested, he didn’t check if I was ready this time; instead, he winked and clicked another button on the remote.

*“What do you hear?”*

Instantly, I could hear sound emanating from each of the stationary objects in the middle of the square. Nothing moved, and yet a loud, rhythmic drumming filled my ears. Despite being able to tell the noise was coming from directly in front of me, it sounded incredibly distant, too. Like it was echoing from the depths of a massive cave system before it reached me standing at the cave’s entrance.

What started a single drum eventually became a frenzied ensemble. Over only a few seconds, hundreds of drum rolls layered over each other until the chaotic pounding caused my head to throb. The Budha was grinning, but that’s not what I heard. I heard the marble figure screaming at me, its voice made of deafening thunder rather than anything recognizably human.

I cradled my temple with my palm and grimaced, shouting an answer to Hewitt’s question.

*“All three things are drumming, same as always, Doc.”*

He clicked the remote again, and like the flick of a switch, the objects became silent immediately. 

*“Thank you, David. Head to the lobby, grab a book and have Annemarie make you a cup of coffee. In about an hour, I’ll call you back. We’ll repeat the procedure, I’ll deactivate the implant, and you’ll be done for the week.”*

My legs pulled my body out of the chair without a shred of hesitation. I was dying to leave the office and get some fresh air. As my hand gripped the doorknob, however, Hewitt’s words rang in my head.

*There are no other patients like you, David.*

I turned back to the doctor, who was now spraying down the statue with the unknown liquid.

“*Hewitt…you mentioned something when we first met in the hospital - about our contract. You said that, eventually, you’d be able to explain to me what we’re doing here. I know I’ve never brought it up before now. I think I used to be more scared of knowing than I was of being left in the dark, and, well…I’ve sort of been feeling the opposite way, as of late. Is that option still on the table?”*

Although he interrupted what he was doing, he didn’t meet my gaze. Instead, he kept his focus on the statue and muttered a halfhearted response.

“*I can appeal to the board. No promises, David.”*

When I returned an hour later, the objects and the pillars were in their same positions, but the Buddha had a new, glistening shine on its marble skin.

As the device activated, the horrible drumming reappeared, but only from the spray bottle and the petri dish. The statue remained eerily quiet. 

Hewitt clicked the remote one last time. The implant beeped three times, and then released one last shockwave, weaker than the one that came with “priming” his part of the device. This supposedly meant the implant had completely deactivated its experimental portion. I was told the designers never intended me to experience the drumming outside a controlled setting.

*“Well, that's all for today. You have my cell phone number. I may not always be able to answer, but call me if there are any issues. Feel free to leave a message, as well.”*

He shook my hand, forced a smile, and then waved me out of his office.

As I turned to leave, my eyes fell on the gleaming statue still sitting on his desk. Although the silence better matched the figure’s smile, I couldn’t help but feel like it was still screaming, berating me for being so naïve.

I just couldn’t hear it anymore.

\------------------

Below, I’ve typed out what I can recall of the messages I left for Hewitt leading up to my inditement. 

Here's what I remember: 

\------------------

***11/05/02 - Six days before the incident.***

***Me:*** *Hey Hewitt. First off, everything is OK. I know I’ve never called you on your cell before, so I don’t want you to think that…I don’t want you to think there’s a big emergency or something. I mean…there kind of was, but I’m alright.*

*I was in a car accident. Drunk driver fell asleep at the wheel, swerved into traffic and I T-boned him. Not sure he walked away from the wreck…but I’m hanging in there, all things considered. Just a broken rib and a nasty concussion on my end. Banged the side of my head against the steering wheel pretty hard.*

*Still hearing everything OK, so I’m assuming the device is working fine, but I figured with the head injury…I figured you might want to know. Especially since our next appointment isn't for another week.*

*Give me a call back at* \[xxx-xxx-xxxx\] *when you can.*

\------------------

***11/06/02 - Five days before.***

***Me:*** *Got your machine again, I guess. Haven’t heard from you, so I suppose you aren’t too worried about me…or the implant. Which is good! Which is good...*

*But…uhh…maybe you should be. I am…after last night.*

*I started…hearing the drumming at home. Just little bits of it, here and there. Much quieter than usual.* 

*I was sitting at my computer…and I heard it in the background of the music I was listening to. It just kind of…appeared. I’m not sure how long it was there before I noticed it. At first, I thought I was hearing things, but as I walked through my apartment, it became louder. Muffled, though. Felt like it was coming from multiple places rather than one. Eventually, I thought I tracked it to a drawer in my kitchen, but when I pulled it opened, it stopped…all of a sudden.*

*I guess it could be the concussion, but the noise is so…distinctive. An invisible jackhammer banging into invisible concrete, like I’ve told you.*

*Anyway…just call me back.*

*Oh! Before I forget, have you heard from the board? I’d…I’d really like to know what this thing does. In addition to my hearing, I mean.*

\------------------

***11/08/02 - Three days before.***

***Me:*** *Doc - where the fuck are you?*

*…sorry. Didn’t mean to lose my temper. I…I haven’t slept.*

*Can the implant…turn on by itself? I’m…I’m definitely hearing…whatever I’m being trained to hear.*

*It’s…it’s everywhere. Comes and goes at random. Or…maybe I’m just starting to hear it when I face it a certain way. My head…it feels like an antenna. If I turn my head up and to the left…it all goes away. Any other position, though, and I can hear the drumming. Like I said - everywhere. On my phone, my clothes, the walls…*

*I…I heard it inside myself, too.*

*I managed to fall asleep, but I guess I relaxed, and my muscles relaxed and…well, my head must have turned, because I could hear it again.* 

*Loud as hell...from the inside of my mouth.* 

*I’m not proud, but I…I kind of freaked out. Put my hands in my mouth and just…just started scraping. I…I wanted it out of me. Dug at my gums…its really bad.*

*I can’t drive, either. I mean, I can try, but I feel like I’ll just get in another wreck, trying to keep my head up and to the left while driving. And…what if it still happens? Even though my heads in the right place?*

*Please…please call me.*

\------------------

***11/10/02 - One day before.***

***Me:*** *…I’ve started to feel it all, Hewitt.*

*The drumming…it’s moving over everything. It’s* ***in*** *everything. It breaks you, and then it rebuilds you again. And now, I have only one sense, not five.*

*I don’t see, I don’t taste, smell, touch…and I certainly don’t hear. Not anymore.*

*But I feel the current.* 

*I feel it writhing and pounding and slipping and fucking and expanding and consuming and living and dying over every…****goddamned****…thing.*

*It speaks to me. Not in a language or a tongue. It’s…it’s a tide. It ebbs and flows.*

*It sings wordless songs to me…and I understand, now.* 

*I thought you cursed me, Hewitt. But all transitions cause pain. I mean, how do you turn a liquid into a gas?*

*You boil it. And when it bubbles its tiny pleading screams, you certainly don’t stop.*

*You turn up the heat.*

\------------------

***11/11/02 - Day of the incident***

***Me:*** *Hello?* **(shouting)**

***Hewitt:*** *David, are you at home?*

***Me:*** *Doc - oh thank God. You…you gotta help me…oh God…it’s…it’s everywhere…I’m nothing…I’m nothing…* **(shouting)**

***Hewitt:*** *Can you get to the-***(I cut him off)**

***Me:*** *Please…please make it stop. Why doesn’t it ever…why doesn’t it ever stop…* **(Crying, shouting)**

***Hewitt:*** *David, I need you to calm down.*

***Me:*** *Am I hearing death, Hewitt? Can God hear what I can hear, Doc, or are they too scared?* **(Laughing, shouting)**

***Hewitt:*** *LISTEN.* **(shouting)**

***Me:*** … **(line goes dead)**

***Hewitt:*** *You’re hearing the microscopic, David. It was all just supposed to be a novel way to test the effectiveness of anti-infectious agents. Once they stopped moving, we know the medication killed them. We stood to make a lot of money off of the technology, but we couldn't prove it worked. Not until you. You’ve…you’ve helped so many people, David…*

***Me:*** **(quietly)** *I’ve been able…able to hear, able to feel…the billions of living things…moving around…on my skin…inside me…everywhere…*

***Hewitt:*** *Don't call an ambulance, don't call the police. We're coming to pick you up.*

\------------------

I don't remember much from that night other than this conversation. I can vaguely recall Hewitt arriving at my apartment, remote in hand. He examines my head, and I'm fading in and out of consciousness. 

When I fully come to, I'm lying on my couch, holding a gun I'd never seen before. A few steps away is Hewitt's corpse. 

And I start crying - not out of fear or confusion, out of relief. 

It's finally quiet. Silent as the grave. The endless drumming of infinite microorganisms crawling around me and within me had vanished. 

My weeping is interrupted by a man rounding the corner into my living room. He's well dressed with dark blue eyes, and he walks over to sit next to me, stepping over Hewitt as he does. 

He introduces himself as Hewitt. Tells me the body won't be needing the name anymore, so it's his now. 

*""Listen, David, we have some new terms. You can still keep the device, meaning you can keep your hearing. Its fixed now, too. You won't be hearing anything you weren't meant to hear from now until the day you die.""*

*""As with any fair deal, I have some conditions. You can't tell anyone what you heard, and you have to take the fall for the killing of the nameless body in front of you. If you do those things, you'll be safe.""*

*""Fail to abide by those conditions, and we're turning the noise back on. All of it. And we'll leave it on, up until the moment you choke on your own tongue. Not a second sooner.""*

*""Do you understand, David?""*

\------------------

I agreed to the terms then, but I've had a little change of heart. Jail gave me perspective. 

You see, the punishment behind incarceration is that you lose your autonomy. That's your incentive to reform. Serve your time, play by the rules and hey, maybe we'll give you your agency back. Maybe you'll have an opportunity to own your body again. 

It makes you realize that agency and autonomy are the only things that really have value in this world. Without them, you have nothing. 

And what is this implant but another jail? I've wanted to speak up for so damn long, but the threat of being subjected to the drumming again has kept me silent. If you don’t have control over your actions, you’re incarcerated no matter where you are.

Well, my priorities have changed. I'm tired of just settling for what they're willing to give me. 

I want my goddamned agency back. 

So, to the creators of the implant, consider this my resignation from our contract. In addition, I have a few choice words. I am relying on the internet to carry them to you, wherever you are.

1ihnnx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/fosterdogs/comments/1ihnnx5/regrets_on_fostering/,regrets on fostering,"My husband and I agreed to foster (to potentially adopt) an absolutely adorable pointer hound/pitty mix. 

We explained several times our one deal breaker was separation anxiety as our previous dog had a severe case and for 8 years we were incredibly isolated because of it.

We picked him up Saturday and from the description from the rescue he was the epitome of a perfect gentleman. Housebroken, knows commands, no medical issues. Because he was in a kennel they didn’t have any food for him so several hours after getting home my husband ran out to the store to pick some up, the poor guy absolutely flipped out. Pacing the house, jumping to look out windows, panting you name it. I then left the house to grab groceries and the same thing, my husband called me after a few mins of being out saying I needed to come back that he wasn’t settling. 

We chalked it up to first day, new house, new people but there was some concern there. Over the course of Saturday he wasn’t settling, incredibly clingy to myself more than my husband followed me everywhere, laid on the bathroom floor while I showered, sat on my feet in the kitchen while I did dishes which raised more red flags.

Sunday AM comes and because we were told how wonderful he was in the crate at his previous foster when they went to work and even slept in it through the night, we decided to just do a coffee run, 15 mins tops to see how he was, the crate door wasn’t even closed and he was wailing, screaming and barking, thrashing around in the crate, we gave him 15 and he wasn’t settling so we went back in.

At this point I’m panicking and so is my husband, we called the rescue who sounded very surprised he was acting that way even the clingy aspect. They then got us in touch with he’s previous foster. She had said she let him out of the crate when they would go out sometimes and she said you could tell he looked for us, furniture chewed, pillows destroyed and even so much as he destroyed her front door of her home and she said it’s a dog thats what they do.

That is a huge red flag to us. That is clearly a dog who has been showing anxiety issues and I can guarantee no fault of his own but we’re heartbroken.

We feel absolutely horrible because he truly is a wonderful dog but we cannot go through the anxiety aspect again. I’ve been in tears, my husband is at a loss, this isn’t what we were expecting based on multiple conversations.

1ihnmkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1ihnmkq/my_my_journey_so_far_not_cured_but_better/,My my Journey so far - Not Cured but Better.,"So my (44M) journey started in late September. I wasn’t living a very healthy at the time. Not a lot of physical activity, drinking a couples glasses of wine a night, more on the weekends, some bourbon here and there. Raging sparkling water addiction, taking 3 ibuprofen on an empty stomach to treat morning headaches fairly often with 3 more after lunch which was usually just a protein bar. Lots of coffee too. Not a solid foundation.

Anyway, I got a bug bite which got infected and was prescribed a 1 week course of 2x100mg doxycycline per day. Got through that no issues, but about 1.5 to 2 weeks later starting having crazy reflux like everything gave me reflux even water. Shortly started burping a bunch, and stools began intermittently loose and mushy and decreased in overall volume. Noticed decreased appetite as well.

Didn’t think much of this at first. Treated off an on with various antacids but didn’t do much to change by bad habbits. Got reflux under control but everything else persisted. By late December I was experiencing crazy chest pressure, bloating in my lower abdomen, Hot Flashes, Heart Palipations, and complete loss of appetite to the point I couldn’t even bring myself to eat, like it felt like my throat would close if I tried to swallow.

First went to urgent care, ran bloods (including pancreatic and liver enzymes), urine and stool tests. Everything was normal. They put me on omeprazole, and told me to follow up with my GI. Omeprazole seemed to help some but I still had off an on loss of appetite.

Got in to see my GI a week later, he suspects Gastris and switched me to Pantoprazole wanted me to take it for 8 weeks and then we’d pursue other testing as needed. 

I’m 3 and half weeks on this medicine now, thanks to posts on this sub I‘ve cleaned up my diet and changed all those bad habits I posted about above. Overall my stomach feels much better. I can always eat even if food doesn’t sound amazing when I start eating. Once I swallow the first bite it tastes good and I’m able to finish the meal. Took me about 2.5 weeks of PPI and diet change to get this far. It’s hard not to go back to old habits on days I’m feeling better.

Still dealing with anxiety and depression (This seems worse since on pantoprazole), and something that feels like Nausea but in my throat / chest. Sometimes that feeling just vanishes out of nowhere. Bloating more too I think (Could be PPI). On the upside my stools aren’t mushy anymore, and last week were even completely normal for a whole week. All in all I hope I’m healing. Regardless of how I feel I plan to ask for an endoscopy when I see my GI again in early March.   
  
I’m seeing my PCP on Monday and going to ask about some sort of anti-depressant since I fear some of my linger symptoms may be caused by anxiety.",4,1738691329.0,Gastritis,2,1.0,False

It also runs pi-hole and serves as a redundant dns server on my lan.

My first question is wondering if adding the tailscale functions is simply too much of a load on a modest Rpi4B. Serving as an exit node and subnet router is a very occasional requirement. FWIW, ram usage does not seem to be a glaring problem on the pi.

My second question has to do with general exit node and subnet router security. My understanding is that all tailscale communication is encrypted. Would you feel completely safe logging into your bank to conduct business or other sensitive web business from a coffee shop or from a foreign country during a tailscale connection? In other words, is there any type of internet activity that you would not do in an insecure location over tailscale?",1,1738691093.0,Tailscale,1,1.0,False

Firstly, I want to thank everyone who’s joined the subreddit, even if they didn’t stick around forever, for their contribution to the achievement of 100,000 members. I was wondering if we’d ever get here considering the game’s discontinuation, but alas here we are.

This is a tremendous achievement for our community, most never get this far. I’ll never forget when I was reached out to and asked to join this mod team. We’ve slimmed down a bit since then, and I do plan to change that in the near future. I never imagined we’d get to this point.

GIVEAWAY
_________

While I don’t have 100k to hand out, I thought I’d do a little $10.00 PayPal giveaway for those who read this far, go buy a coffee! All you have to do to enter is comment anything. I’ll be locking the post in 24 hours and using comment picker to choose a winner. The winner will be pinned to the comments and receive a DM requesting PayPal info. You must have a valid PayPal account, money will be USD. 

*I’m aware this could technically be construed as a violation of “no real world currency exchange,” but as the spirit of that rule is intended to prohibit trading in game items for real currency and vice versa, I’m hoping people would rather just enjoy the giveaway then try to lynch me for it. We’ll see* 

Thank you all for your support and participation over the years, we couldn’t be here without you!

Happy dungeon crawling!

1ihnf1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ihnf1t/aita_for_wanting_my_sister_to_leave_my_life/,AITA for wanting my sister to leave my life?,"I (22M) have a sister (25F) who's getting married in two weeks. She wants to complete every single small thing in her apartment before finally moving in with her husband after the wedding. I've been with her since scratch going on errands getting every single thing she wants ever since her engagement about a year ago, going on long drives and staying hours and hours roaming around getting random stuff like sheets, kitchenware, decors, carpets, etc. from various places on about 3-5 hour drives.

Lately she's been growing more anxious, understandably because the wedding's getting closer, and more demanding of me. Even though I'm a medical student and don't have a lot of free time but been supportive of her in all the times I could spare. 

She even started to guilt me into helping her in the days I had legitimate excuses not to go more than once. Saying things like ""I'll never forget it if you don't drive me there, I'll always hate you for it"" and berates me for giving excuses no matter what I say. 

The thing is, she can drive fine on her own. She just doesn't like driving at night so she just brings me along to drive for her and basically if there was anyone else she wouldn't even consider bringing me along at all, and her fiance doesn't have a car ofc.

So yesterday, I've been up working on an already late project after driving her all night so I slept for 2 hours and then woke up with water splashed on my face by my sister claiming I was ""pretending"" to sleep to not go with her even though we've been going on errands almost every single day for weeks without me complaining about it. She yelled and swore at me for being a hateful unsupportive brother and said she'd never forgive me ever for this as long as she's alive. 

I didn't have time to process what's going on from all the yelling so I got up and said I'd go with her, she then thanked me and said she loved me very much and I'm a great brother like nothing happened. But after we got there I just didn't feel like walking around all day anymore, so I told her I wanted to sleep in the car until she finishes getting her things instead. I could feel that she didn't like that but I was too tired to argue.

After a couple of hours she got back and I woke up with a really aching back and not much sleep. I had a strong headache didn't really feel like talking then so I gave small responses when she tried to speak to end conversations and just get back home. I got myself a couple of coffees on the way and stayed there in silence most of the drive and I could sense that it's upsetting her.

Now she's mad at me and won't even address me anymore. Her avoidance actually feels like a relief but also hurts my conscience that I've upset her somehow.


~ ~ ~

I genuinely don't hate my sister, I really do love her and I'm really happy that she's getting married and I understand how stressful it could be. 

But I think a lot of that happiness may come from her leaving and I don't know how to feel about it.


EDIT: I know she's demanding and we're both adults here. But everybody has a different view in something and maybe I'm biased in a way I dont see since I'm only telling things from my perspective. I keep in my mind that she's only a guest now technically and she probably won't ask me to help around again once she's married. So all I want now is to at least give her a nice memory before she leaves for good. Though in all honesty I doubt she'd see anything past the things she'd been upset about.",3,1738690807.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False

It was a deep, meaningful relationship, but we struggled with poor communication and frequent fights. Eventually, she broke things off in the middle of therapy, saying she needed time and space. I took full accountability for my role in the breakup, started therapy, and got medicated for my undiagnosed ADHD. 

After months of no contact, we connected for her to retrieve an ambulance bill from getting blackout drunk on New Years Eve, and we ended up talking for three hours. Lots of mixed signals—laughs, catching up, apologies, telling me she’s “less angry,” but no clarity.   
  
She ended up connecting with my mother after for coffee and agreed to give my son a short visit because she had a massive role in his life and they hadn't talked since she left. It felt like there was still something there, like she was trying to connect, and keep connected to my circle. But then—**radio silence again.** No real conversations about the relationship, the breakdown, or where we stand. And I have been worried about her safety since hearing about the hospital visit. 

**The thing that’s been bothering me**: she still has belongings in my basement and during that three hour conversation asked if I could store them for a while longer. We were connecting and that confused me, I would do something like that for a friend, so I agreed at the time.   
  
But after all the confusion, back-and-forth, mixed signals and storing her belongings for almost eight months, I finally sent her an email **today** saying I want her things gone by a certain date, or I’ll be donating them. My intention isn’t to be petty—I gave her until March 9th to make arrangements—it’s to cut the last remaining thread of uncertainty. I don’t want to keep holding space for someone who won’t actually communicate.

**I don’t know if I did the right thing.**   
  
Was this fair?   
Should I have handled it differently?

I’m looking for chill, clean and awesome roomies to move in to my wonderful Bedstuy apartment with me! 😀 

open to two scenarios:
 ONE other roommate for $1850 a month and you’d have one room and a office room or we can use it as a spare bedroom for guests /and extra closet space (which is what I’ve been doing the past few years) and it would just be the two of us in the apartment 
or
THREE roommates total for $1250 each, we each have a room and still have a small extra room for storage. I have done this before and it doesn’t feel too crowded especially with the extra bathroom and if we have varying schedules 

Move in - march 1, may be a little flexible! Would love at least a 6 month commitment (8/25) but definitely open to a year lease   
I've lived here for 7+ years and love, love, LOVE the apartment and location ❤

4 bedroom, 1.5 bath 
One of the rooms is extra used for storage/visitors 🙂

Move in is first and last month's rent 

About me - early 30’s with a sweet sweet 1 year old pup! I’m pretty chill, not new to roommate living and like to hang out and catch up if we have the chance but we don’t have to be bffs. I work mostly on site m-f and go to a lot of events in the afternoon/evenings. Would love to find a great fit for the apartment and keep the space comfortable for each other by keeping shared spaces clean and getting along! 

Prefer someone in their late 20's or older, who understands Black lives matter, are LGBTQ friendly, and who are actively trying to make this a better world.

I am the Rector of a historic church in the middle of a major urban area.  We have a robust ministry serving people in deep poverty and homelessness.  We welcome these neighbors as fellow worshipers, offer food, community, clothing, social support, and employment counseling.  We have even hired some of our less fortunate neighbors when appropriate.  

Over the past year, an overnight community has sprung up on our various outdoor stairways, landings, and other areas—about 7 or 8 people.  I know some of them—they clean up and are gone before dawn.  Or we invite them in for coffee when we open later in the morning.   

Some of the folks who sleep on our stairs have been displaying unacceptable behaviors.  They have been harassing passersby—usually men harassing women.  One passerby was physically assaulted in the very early morning.  Since this happens when we are closed, usually before first light or late at night, our staff don’t know about it and can’t do anything about it.  

The police have not been responsive.  And I don’t want to install “hostile architecture” such as spikes on the landings, which I’ve seen other public spaces do.  I’m working with my leadership and some community organizations to try to arrive at some creative and compassionate solutions.  I have also reached out to our Diocesan staff, who are usually helpful and quick to respond   

If we don’t address this, this unsafe and inappropriate situation will continue.  And we risk more people getting hurt.  We also risk burning the considerable goodwill the community has for our efforts to address deep poverty.  

I’m posting here because I’m sure other churches have dealt with this issue.  What compassionate, safe, creative solutions have you tried?  What has worked, and what didn’t?   ",24,1738690396.0,Episcopalian,9,1.0,False

My husband of 12 years has transformed from a reasonable conservative into what I can only describe as a Trump cult member, and it's destroying our marriage.



Our house has become a literal shrine to Trump. I wish I was exaggerating. There's a 6-foot Trump cardboard cutout in our living room that he talks to every morning like some sort of religious ritual. Our walls, once decorated with family photos, are now plastered with Trump flags. He even replaced our American flag with a ""Trump 2024 or Death"" banner. My kids are embarrassed to have friends over.



Last week was the final straw. He spent $3,000 of our savings on ""limited edition"" Trump gold-plated coins and a ""certified authentic"" piece of Mar-a-Lago toilet paper. THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. When I confronted him about taking money from our children's college fund, he said ""Trump University will be reopened and make education great again."" I couldn't make this shit up if I tried.



Every dinner conversation somehow turns into a Trump sermon. He'll randomly shout ""STOP THE STEAL"" during family meals. When our 15-year-old daughter got an A+ on her history project about the Civil War, he accused her teacher of being a ""communist infiltrator"" for not teaching ""the truth about Trump's victory.""



Our bedroom... God, I'm mortified to even type this. He insists on keeping a giant Trump portrait above our bed because ""Trump watches over us."" He even got a Trump tattoo on his chest and keeps trying to convince me to get one too. He calls it his ""Mark of Patriotism.""



His entire personality has been consumed. He changed his wardrobe to only red clothing. He refers to himself as a ""Digital Soldier"" and spends hours posting on Truth Social. When I asked him to help with our son's homework, he said he was too busy ""fighting the deep state online.""



The paranoia is getting worse. He installed cameras around our house to ""watch for Antifa."" He thinks our neighbors are ""deep state agents"" because they have a pride flag. He threw out our coffee maker because ""Starbucks is funding the radical left."" He even accused our golden retriever of being ""suspiciously woke"" because she didn't bark at a Biden commercial.



Our sex life? He insists on playing Trump rally speeches in the background and keeps trying to get me to wear a Melania mask. I wish I was joking. He has different MAGA hats for different occasions - including one specifically for ""bedroom patriot time."" I'm dying inside.



I found receipts showing he's donated over $15,000 to various Trump-related causes this year alone. Money we needed for our mortgage. When I showed him our overdue bills, he said ""Trump will fix the economy and make us rich."" We're facing foreclosure, but he keeps buying Trump merchandise.



Yesterday, he announced he's legally changing his name to ""Donald J. Trump Smith"" and wants our kids to follow suit. Our 10-year-old son started crying, and my husband told him ""real patriots don't cry"" and made him watch four hours of rally footage as ""testosterone training.""



I've tried everything - marriage counseling (he called the therapist a socialist), family interventions (he disowned his own mother for suggesting he get help), even pleading with his Trump-supporting friends to tell him he's going too far. Nothing works. He just goes deeper into the rabbit hole.



The worst part? Under all this Trump worship, I know my real husband is still in there somewhere. Sometimes, late at night, I catch glimpses of the man I married. But then morning comes, he puts on his MAGA hat, salutes the Trump cutout, and the cycle begins again.",6,1738690162.0,copypasta,0,1.0,False

I think it was for about 8 hours. I played a subliminal track with rain sounds and affirmations to help stop obsessive negative thoughts. I believe it is the reason I slept so well. Some of the affirmations on the list were: 

•When I wake up each morning, I feel great
•When I wake up each morning, I feel relaxed
•When I wake up each morning, I am full of happiness
•When I wake up each morning, I feel amazing

The first angel number I saw today was 949. 
More guidance about embracing my skills and talents. Apparently, the world really needs what I have to offer. Also, reminding me to control how I spend my time and energy by avoiding negativity if I can... because I have control over how my day goes. I notice that I have often tended to spend a lot of time and energy focusing on peoples' negativity here on Reddit. To me, it is the most hostile internet environment there is. Lots of anonymous smart guys and gals that have grown complacent in this space with their attitudes, opinions, and condescending, insulting, belittling comments. I mean...bullies! Am I right? I don't understand why we can't all just be nice here. 

I hear someone playing Teena Marie downstairs. I got the chills upon hearing her amazing, beautiful voice. RIP Teena.

I am about to boil water for my first cup of coffee. I like medium Colombian roast, black with coconut sugar and cinnamon these days. 

I'll shower while it's cooling down. I am going to wear black and white today. 

I felt a shift in the shower. My surroundings looked less familiar than usual. Hopefully, it wasn't someone else's energy. I normally set an intention, pray, use visualization, and think/say affirmations during my shower. I forgot because I didn't want my coffee to get too cold. 

My main prayer lately is the protection of me and my loved ones. 

I am a regular kratom user. I prefer the strain Train Wreck. I got insulted once in the past during intake at a mental institution for mentioning it. The rude woman couldn't understand why anyone would ever consume such a thing. I wonder if she ever took out the time to educate herself about kratom. I'm no expert, but I think being an actual user gives me a little more ground to pass judgments on it. I think it's my prerogative to self-medicate, especially if I had so many unpleasant side effects from the pills doctors used to prescribe me. They actually ended up medicating me very heavily in that particular mental facility. Shame on them. 

I have my kratom with my coffee, however it is not something I would recommend to someone that isn't used to either one. I've built up quite a tolerance to both over the last couple of months or so. It's how I like to start my day. Coffee has always kept me regular, if you catch my drift. Kratom helps me with my mood and also with meditation. Kratom and coffee can both be addictive, and I do believe they are both medicine and a habit for me. I am also a Cannabis user. The combination of coffee, kratom, and Cannabis = 🤌🏾

I try to make sure I drink at least 8 oz. of water (preferably Aquafina) before I consume my plant medicines. 

Reheating my coffee because it cooled down too much while I was composing this diary entry. I truly enjoy writing. I think it was one of my first skills. It became a hobby and eventually a passion. I've gone in and out of it throughout my life, writing in diaries, notebooks, on computers, phones... poems, stories, songs, my life, you name it. 

I look forward to sharing my writing and my experiences here, even if Reddit users try to ruin it for me. I believe the right types of people will see and appreciate it. And me. ",1,1738689814.0,Diary,0,1.0,False

Context:

Wife and I, WFH jobs. Wife is 8PM-6AM. Me, 8PM-9AM (2 clients).

We are hands-on parents and usually I prepare the kiddo for school around 6AM-7AM, drop her off at school, then go home for a while to finish my work till 9AM and pick her up around 10. Usually my wife is already asleep by then, so I look after the kiddo until 1PM-2PM then we switch. I usually wake up at 7PM the cycle.

Earlier today I had to process paperwork for one of our properties that is about to be sold. So instead of the usual routine, I had to come out, drive in the city, go to offices, make payments and etc.

Came home at 4PM, slept till 7PM, now I'm working. I had tasks lined up since usually Q1 is super busy for both clients. Had my coffee, ate bfast/dinner whatever you call it.

Then I figured daughter was still awake, she wanted me beside her while working so I did. Then come around 12AM wife had a meeting, I have an upcoming meeting at 1AM. Daughter still not trying to sleep. So I tried to put her to sleep, hyms, sang songs, all of those but she still wouldn't sleep.

She then felt that we are forcing her to sleep, so she burst out crying, about her toys, her pillows, full-on 100% crying. Well, my temper got the best of me. I shouted at her, told her to stop crying cause it's bed time. Took all her toys from the bed and shoved it into the next room. 

Her mom then took her after her meeting, put her to sleep, now she's good.

Tbf, I feel like garbage right now. Shitty me, can't control my temper in front of my wife and kid. Ended up shouting at her, forcing her to stop crying and go to sleep. After all of this, I thought about putting myself in her shoes, and I thought to myself, what a shitshow of a dad.

1ihmtb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1ihmtb6/havent_brewed_a_good_v60/,Haven't brewed a good V60,"Hello everyone.

Why do the coffee gods hate me?

I've done everything, yet I haven't even produced one delicious cup of V60.

I'll explain.

Here is what I have:
- 3 different bags of coffee (Costa Rica Mirazu (raisin honey), Ethiopia Guji/Hambella (natural), and Colombia Narino (washed)), all between 3-4 weeks past their roast date.
- KINGrinder K6
- Gooseneck kettle with a thermometer
- 0.1g MHW-3BOMBER coffee scale.
- 10-step water filtration + RO + remineralization system under my sink (giving me a TDS of around 20), which I use to make my own water (using Alex Levitt's recipes in A Waste of Coffee website and Coffee Ad Astra's favorite recipes) because on its own, it gave me battery acid cups

Here's what I've done:
- Every recipe (from 1-pour to 5-pours) including Hoffman's, Hedrick's, Rao's, Perger's, Vibrant Coffee Roaster's, and a hell lot more
- Every ratio (from 1:15 to 1:20)
- Every temp (from around 90°C to boiling)
- Every water recipe
- Every agitation (from none, to swirling, stirring, excavating, laminar flows, turbulent flows)
- Various grind settings (50, 60, 80, 100, and 120 clicks on the K6 (my K6's true 0 is around -5, but I count from the stated 0)) --> at 120, the astringency was lower, but water ran through the bloom so fast that it didn't even let me stir it. The bloom was too tall, and dry.
- I get drawdowns from 2:15 to 3:30

Here are my results:
- Tasteless cups
- Astringent cups
- Sour cups
- A mix of all three

I know the potential of my beans (had them in the roastery). I know what good coffee tastes like. I know what I want from them.

But for the life of me, no matter what I do, I have not made one single good cup of V60.

Would any of you professionals help me achieve a sweet, delicious, juicy cup of coffee? I'd appreciate it WAY MORE than you can even imagine.",2,1738689327.0,pourover,17,0.75,False
1ihmsjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1ihmsjb/cuisinart_ss15p1_review_is_this_dual_coffee_maker/,Cuisinart SS-15P1 Review: Is This Dual Coffee Maker Worth It?,"I’ve been running the Cuisinart SS-15P1 Coffee Maker through its paces every single day for a while now, and I have plenty to share. This machine is a dual-purpose marvel with a 12-cup carafe on one side and a single-serve brewer on the other. It’s like having two coffee makers in one, which is already a win for my cluttered countertop. But of course, not everything is perfect. Let me break it down for you in a way that might remind you of a Reddit thread—real, unfiltered, and with a touch of humor.

**Design & Build Quality**

The first thing that caught my attention about the Cuisinart SS-15P1 was its sleek stainless-steel and black finish. It’s an aesthetic that screams modern kitchen, and I’ll admit, it fits better with my decor than I do after my first cup of coffee in the morning. It’s a bit taller than your average coffee maker, standing at 14.25 inches, but it manages to stay compact at just over 10 inches wide. My only gripe? The water reservoir for the carafe side is a little awkward to fill. If your hand isn’t steady, prepare for some spills. A pitcher helps, but let’s face it, I’m not always in the mood to play water-wrangler before sunrise.

Durability-wise, this machine feels solid. At 12.2 pounds, it’s hefty enough to stay put during use, and the materials seem built to last. The buttons are responsive, and the carafe handle feels sturdy. However, I can see the rubber seal on the single-serve side potentially wearing out over time if you’re not careful.

**Brewing Performance**

I’m a fan of how quickly this machine brews. The carafe side can whip up a full 12 cups in about 10 minutes, and the single-serve brewer gives you a cup in under two minutes, depending on your chosen size (6, 8, or 10 ounces). The machine offers a “Bold” setting on the carafe side, which has become my go-to for those mornings when I need an extra jolt to get moving. I’ve noticed the single-serve side works well with both K-Cups and the reusable filter for ground coffee, adding some versatility to my caffeine routine.

That said, the single-serve side does have a bit of splatter when brewing smaller cup sizes. It’s not a deal-breaker, but if you’re wearing a white shirt, maybe keep a napkin handy. Also, the single-serve water reservoir holds 40 ounces, which is decent, but I do find myself refilling it more often than I’d like.

**Coffee Flavor**

Let’s talk about what really matters: the coffee. I’ve tested the Cuisinart SS-15P1 with various blends, from light roasts to dark, and the machine consistently delivers a rich and smooth cup. The carafe side, with its wedge-shaped filter basket, does a great job of extracting flavor, and I’ve found I can use slightly less coffee grounds without sacrificing taste. On the single-serve side, the results are just as satisfying, though I do prefer using the reusable filter for a more robust flavor profile.

One thing I appreciate is the ability to control carafe water temperature and brew strength. These features have made it easier to customize my coffee exactly how I like it—no more lukewarm disappointments or weak brews.

**Cleaning & Maintenance**

Cleaning this machine is mostly a breeze. The carafe and its components are dishwasher-safe, which saves me time. The single-serve side has a removable drip tray that accommodates travel mugs and makes cleanup straightforward. My only annoyance? The carafe’s water reservoir is a little tricky to reach, so I find myself using a sponge on a stick to get it clean. The auto-clean function is a nice touch, but it doesn’t eliminate the need for occasional deep cleaning.

**Pros**

* Dual functionality: 12-cup carafe and single-serve brewer in one.
* Sleek stainless-steel design that looks great in any kitchen.
* Adjustable brew strength and temperature for customized coffee.
* Works with K-Cups or ground coffee for versatility.
* Quick brewing times on both sides of the machine.

**Cons**

* Awkward water reservoir design for the carafe side.
* The single-serve side can splatter during brewing.
* Rubber seals on the single-serve side might wear out over time.
* Requires regular deep cleaning for optimal performance.

**Comparison to Competitors**

I’ve used other dual coffee makers like the Keurig K-Duo and Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, so I feel qualified to compare. The Keurig K-Duo has a slightly more user-friendly water reservoir but falls short on brew temperature and flavor extraction. The Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, while cheaper, didn’t impress me with its build quality or brewing speed. The Cuisinart SS-15P1 edges out both competitors with its superior brew customization, robust design, and better-tasting coffee.

Where the Cuisinart lags is in ease of use. The awkward water reservoir and occasional splattering might put off some users, especially if you’re used to the simplicity of a Keurig. However, if you prioritize coffee quality and don’t mind a small learning curve, this machine is a solid choice.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

The Cuisinart SS-15P1 isn’t the cheapest dual coffee maker on the market, but it’s also not the most expensive. Considering its durable build, versatile brewing options, and high-quality coffee output, I’d say it’s worth the investment. You’re essentially getting two machines in one, which frees up counter space and simplifies your morning routine. Plus, the ability to use ground coffee or K-Cups adds a level of flexibility that many competitors lack.

Here are some creators I can think of that mostly never step outside of their bubble: David Pakman, Brian Tyler Cohen, Pondering Politics, the hosts of Pod Save America, The Serfs, Vaush, HasanAbi, Kyle Kulinski, Pisco, etc.

Now compare this to the right, where creators go around on podcast circuits with a wide range of different lifestyles. For example, The Iced Coffee Hour had Ben Shapiro on, and it feels like the two hosts are becoming more and more right-wing with their framing of topics. Or consider Jocko Willink's show, where, despite being libertarian, the lack of left-wing voices or differing perspectives causes him to lean even further right.

Most of the creators I mentioned have spoken about the need for congressional Democrats to engage more with broader media, such as podcasts. However, in my opinion, they are being hypocritical by not doing what they preach, even though they are leaders themselves and have more freedom than congressional Democrats to do so.

How can we push these creators to break into other podcasts or channels?",14,1738689247.0,Destiny,9,0.85,False

I'm one of those self-proclaimed ""coffee snob elitist"" types^0 ***in search of a local***^1 ***café*** that offers an ***""Activated Charcoal""***^2 ***latte***. In my caffeine driven search, I've not come across one in the Calgary area ~~before~~ in recent times! 

If you have never had it before, it tends to impart an earthy flavour into the drink, which is quite nice, IMO. 

I first experienced this drink working in the Red Deer area at a café called ""Dose"" (shout out, BTW, recommend to my coffee fans if you are in the area!) and I fell in love. Every time they bring it back, I am bombarded by some Red Deer locals sharing images of them enjoying it, and it pains me so! Woe is me!

1ihmpbx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ihmpbx,"How I found the link between all skin conditions; rosacea, acne, psoriasis, eczema and auto immune diseases","In summery I will share my findings to start healing the root cause of these skin conditions. The pictures I’ve shared are me and some of the girls I gave this pdf to. Everyone who tried this did get relief within 1-2 weeks and continued improvement over time. 

I started hating my skin was I was 13 and took my first round of Accutane around 14/15. The doctors prescribed it 3-4 times and after that I had to buy it from china because it’s illegal to give someone Accutane more than 3-4 times. 

By the time I was in my late twenties I was willing to do ANYTHING to find the root cause of my suffering. I spent hours on YouTube until I found a man named Ben Fuchs and my gut told me he had the answers. I was luck enough to be able to speak with him and learn more. 

One day before a big trip to my boyfriend’s family’s house in Chicago my face got really red and irritated. I called Ben and told him I was so upset I was going to say I was sick on not get on the plane to go see my boyfriend’s family for the holidays. He said “so just eat kale salt and olive oil for a week” I was so desperate I would try anything at that point. So for seven days I marinated the kale in olive oil with salt and ate that raw salad. Nothing else. By the seventh day my skin was glowing and clear. I proceeded to go through an elimination diet from there. First adding watermelon to the menu with my kale salad, waiting three days on the new diet. With no reaction to watermelon I was able to add in the next food, I went with nutritional yeast to add to the kale salad. 

I went through this process with each food and spice one by one. Waiting 72 hours with each ingredient. If there’s a reaction, I would drop the new item, wait for the reaction to clear, then try a new ingredient.

While going through the elimination phase, I diligently took all the supplements designed to heal my gut suggested by Ben. Giving my gut a break from all the foods that were irritating it and soothing my gut with all the herbs and supplements. 

When I went through all the foods, my trigger list was long; containing things like onion, garlic, coffee, chocolate, avacado, dairy, gluten, soy and more. I strictly adhered to only the foods I could process without getting a skin reaction for 6-8 months. At that point my skin had been clear for awhile and I would try reintroducing some foods one by one in small amounts to check for a reaction. Some where okay to bring back into my diet and some  have been a no for over ten years. Major allergens are likely included in the forever no list, for example wheat or dairy will always get multiple negative reactions from my body. Corn is also a no but it’s not as harsh so once in awhile in a small amount won’t kill me and I know what to expect. 

I took several others through this same process. I will now list the protocol below. I wish you all healing. 


Healing leaky gut

Autoimmune protocol 

Part one THE BASICS



ANYTHING that touches your skin should be free from chemicals and synthetic fragrances. Natural mineral makeup should be used and all other products need to be natural. If something contains “fragrance” that is not listed as an essential oil it should not come into contact with your skin. Enjoy brands like; Eco-chic, Tarte, Bare Minerals, Acure, IT cosmetics, etc. 

Pillow cases should be changed regularly, hair kept clean and free from product when sleeping. A head full of hairspray or gel gets on your pillow case and ends up all over your face left to absorb for 8 hours while you sleep, not exactly the ideal beauty regime. 

All makeup brushes should be washed once a week and then kept in a ziplock bag where the brushes won’t collect a bunch of different bacteria. Use clean hands when you are using your brushes to keep the whole set up as clean as possible since these brushes go directly on your face. Keep hands clean and away from your face. Don’t touch your own face or let others touch your face. 

Only use cetaphil type cleanser or coconut oil to wash face. Harsh foaming agents and exfoliators irritate the skin. Your skin needs to be treated delicately. You can use oil cleanser for the first round of cleansing to remove makeup.

Daily take 3-5 shots of ACV mixed with pure aloe vera juice and water around mealtime as well as 2-5 digestive enzymes; preferred time is before the meal. This part is critical and must be done diligently. Other supplements you will want to start taking are; probiotics ( large amounts daily), NAC, NAG, OMEGA3/6/9, quality multivitamin, digestive bitters (with meals), 

You can make a shot of all the liquid vitamins like aloe, ACV, digestive bitters, etc to take at once. You can also make a gut healing lemonade with Lite Lemonade (simply and Trader Joe’s makes one) Ice, Water, ACV & Aloe 

Use blue light therapy spot treatments while you’re healing.
You can also get an LED light mask with a range of colors. It will have the blue option for acne and the red option for redness. All of them will help with anti-aging (BONUS!)

IMMEDIATELY stop eating ALL dairy, nuts, soy, corn & gluten - these must strictly not be consumed.Read labels carefully. 

 


Remove major allergens immediately 
Soy
Corn
Gluten
All nuts (seeds could quite possibly be fine but you need to test it out)
Dairy 
Banana has been also shown to be hard to digest for some people

Secondary group of foods that may be triggering: 
All night shades;
Tomatoes 
White potato
Peppers
Eggplant 


Keep a very specific food diary everyday. When foods are digested that may cause a reaction anywhere from immediately-72 hours, take this into account. Write down the state of your symptoms daily to track and record data. Food/symptom comparison will be very useful to look back on 


Supplements to add in immediately:
ACV shot mixed with aloe Vera juice at every meal (prior WHENEVER possible) 
Digestive enzymes (my top fav right now is called super digestaway) must take 2-5 with every meal
NAG
NAC
Digestive bitters can be mixed with aloe and ACV shot at meals 
You can also make a lemonade with light or regular lemonade (simply light lemonade is my fav) add half lemonade , half water, ice, ACV and pure aloe Vera juice. Great cocktail to sip on all day to promote healthy gut and digestion. 
Eat fermented foods like kimchi and kombucha daily 
Take strong probiotics daily- 3-7 per day 
Try drinking celery juice every morning for a month straight; if this helps at all keep going. It’s great for a multitude of other things as well. 

When things get really bad try only eating one or two foods for a week, like raw kale salad dressed with olive oil, salt and pepper ...if this becomes too hard add in watermelon and see if you still feel relief.. from here if all symptoms cease you can try adding one food at a time with 72 hour window to observe the body’s reaction. This would be how you start a true elimination diet and test each food out one by one so you can be 100% sure what is causing the problem. This is the advanced route to healing. All supplements are still required for the first year to heal the gut lining. 


Once all triggers have been identified a simplistic diet must be kept while taking the supplements until autoimmune sufferer feels much less sensitive. Usually foods are tested and eliminated for 1-3 months which keeps the diet simple for around 6-8 months depending on how quickly gut recovers. 

Some triggering foods may be SLOWLY added back in if they were the ones that didn’t cause major reactions but minor sensitivities. This is done after symptoms have ceased, gut seems to be healing ( no auto immune reactions) and the triggering foods have been out of the diet for awhile, while taking all supplements daily.

43 later this year.
Blue eyes, auburn hair, 5’5” and usually about 185-190. 
One kid - almost 19 and lives on own.
AuDHD

I’m a creative soul who values deep, meaningful connections with people—whether that’s as a friend or a romantic partner. I’m all about building relationships where communication, honesty, and respect for boundaries are key. I believe that no one person can be everything for anyone else, and I’m looking for those who share the idea that connection and authenticity are the foundation of any relationship. I’m also a strong believer in building up the people around me and expect the same in return.

I love spending time outdoors. Whether it's kayaking, fishing, rock hounding, or simply exploring a riverbed or forest. I’m always on the lookout for new adventures…I love getting lost in nature—whether it’s hiking, chasing mushrooms, or simply soaking in the beauty of the forest or a body of water. I just love being outside. I work from home most of the time so getting outside is paramount to my mental health. 

I have several special interests:
- I’m passionate about birds/parrots. I have three and they’re my heart and soul. 
- People, their behavior and choices. I’m a people watcher. I love asking questions and understanding you know what drives a person‘s decisions and likes and interests. 
- The Office; yes I cringe a lot now rewatching but it’s always been a comfort show. I love learning facts about it and sharing quotes.
- Water; love being on it, in it, near it…bout the only thing I take offense to it having to drink it.
- Color coding
- Finding things; I Spy books, Where’s Waldo, your keys, the exact waffle iron I’ve wanted for 2 years for less than I wanted to pay at the thrift store in brand new condition, my will to keep going in cooperate America each day (that’s ones tough some days admittedly), fucks to give just when I thought I’d run out…if it’s lost…I can probably find it.
- Hearing/seeing neurospicy people share about their special interests.
- Trivia Nights; I don’t drink but I love all the rest of it. 

I have several indoor hobbies as well. Having ADHd means I bounce between them frequently but tend to find my way back to these. Painting, crafting, building (from Legos to coffee tables), tabletop games, card games, or other board games. I’m a huge fan of anything that taps into my creative side. Writing, reading, coloring, cross stitch, embroidery, mosaics, etc. 

What I’m Looking For:
- Connections where we can really talk, listen, and support each other. 
- I love connecting with people who can teach me something new or offer fresh perspectives. 
- If you're into nature, games, or simply sharing thoughts about books, life, or political discussions, we’ll likely vibe well together.
- Friendship/companionship
- Someone that wants to chat throughout the day, share life events, get advice, build on it daily. 
- Community

I’m pansexual and demisexual (I need a strong emotional connection before things go physical)…oh and I’m definitely sapiosexual…so I’m really attracted to someone who stimulates my mind and makes me feel understood. I’m open to both online and in-person connections, with a preference for people who can engage in thoughtful conversations about everything from books and politics to climate change and life’s little moments.

I have an almost 19-year-old kiddo who is transgender and I need any potential connection to be accepting and supportive of them. If you can’t respect that, please don’t reach out.

Being that one of my special interests is people (and how their minds work) and I have a special set of skills…understand that I come authentically and have expectations of those in my life to do the same. I do not tolerate disrespect of other human beings. I want to surround myself with people who lift each other up and genuinely care. I don’t mesh well with far-right conservatives or people who push extreme religious views onto others. I believe in having thoughtful discussions, but I’m not here to argue or convince anyone of my beliefs. So please be respectful in return regarding that area of things. I’m on a personal spiritual thing and diving deep to address the root causes of the things I don’t like about myself and how I operate as a person. Honesty, kindness, and mutual respect are a must.

If you’re someone who values connection over superficial relationships, enjoys creative pursuits, and wants to have meaningful conversations, let’s talk! I’m looking to build a circle of people who feel like home, where we can confide in each other, support one another, and grow together.",4,1738688799.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I was advised by a naturopath that goat milk is a better alternative for cows milk, and based on my research it makes more sense for people with sensitive to dairy or if dairy flares their skin up.

I use it for things like tea, milkshakes, coffee, hot chocolate etc. It doesn't taste the same as cow milk but after a while it becomes normal and just tastes like milk to you.

I have noticed a difference in my skin by switching to goat milk.

If you're sensitive to dairy and can't resist your daily coffee/tea intake like me, you should try out goat milk.",3,1738688454.0,eczema,0,1.0,False

Hey there, fellow Redditors!

Valentine’s Day is coming up, and instead of spending it third-wheeling my coffee cup and a hospital shift, I figured—why not put myself out there? So, here I am, looking for a fun, easygoing Valentine to share some good company, laughter, and maybe a little teasing chemistry.

A little about me: I’m an intern doctor (yes, long hours, but also skilled hands—just saying), a coffee addict (flat whites and Aeropress are my love language), and a sucker for movies, music gigs, and deep conversations. If you like good banter, a little playful back-and-forth, and the idea of getting lost in a great conversation, we’ll get along just fine.

I’m thinking of something simple but fun—grabbing coffee, watching a movie, maybe even hitting up a bookstore or a gig. And who knows? If we hit it off, maybe the night doesn’t have to end too early. No pressure, just good vibes, playful tension, and seeing where the day takes us.

Tell me something fun about yourself—your guilty pleasure song, a movie you can quote word for word, your favourite coffee order or the last time you did something spontaneous. Drop a comment or slide into my DMs—I promise I don’t bite… unless you’re into that ;)",1,1738688433.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Monday comes around and since im going out of state and leaving it in another state they wanted a major credit card to put on file. well i havent had a credit card in 10 years when i crawled out of cc debt. and the person had to be there in person so from 7 am to 12 we went running around to other places. we finally agreed to my roommate to drive down there and back ...got on the road finally around 1 pm (5 hours late by this point) did pretty good only broke down once in a crying frustrated punched a wall 2 x fit ... drove 10 hours and landed around midnight unloaded what we could and got to bed so 7 am to 1 am i was up MONDAY  tuesday it was up and at then 630 because the rental needed to get back on the road no coffee this day.. fighting a cold now and trying to spend as much time with my dad he is now in a coma and we got the confirmation that it will be hours or weeks at this point. Meanwhile I'm trying to unpack and organize and take dogs out 6 of them here. take care of my son. doing laundry and some dishes. dad passes at 8 o clock Tuesday. i will never forget looking for a pulse on my dad and finding none,  a flurry of activity waiting for the coroner to come and collect him. i try to comfort my son my mom my brother. cue to midnight and my son has his first ear infection and my moms yelling at me to take him to emergent care and i have to go how mom and where do i go !!! so have to drag my mom out with us. goes quick we get home finally around 1 and in bed by 2 am. back up at 7 am no coffee still got a cold and this is Wednesday now. and my mom and brother leave to go to funeral home and im left to take my kiddo out to get his antibiotics and cant get them because i have state insurance and for some reason the prescription is not there... so i drive back home and check the paper work and nope no script so like WTF im doing laundry and dishes and walking my dog. exhausted yes but still plunging on still unpacking packing up a closet of my dads stuff by myself.  finally think wow i cant get to sleep early tonight nope sons awake till 11 at night yay ! thursday up at 7 again and no coffee cold is better to the point that i can take a hike with the pack. running to town with mom and getting stuff with her for the farm. Thursday afternoon and i hear my brother screaming at my son because he cant lift these horse feed buckets that have water in them mind you they are like huge pails that have water soaked feed in them my son comes in crying and just heartbroken and i knew then that im trading one narcissist for another and my son and i not  even safe here. Friday we are supposed to leave to go back to WI so i held my tongue and didn't confront my brother like i wanted. Guess what finally Thursday i take my dog out for the last time and i get to sleep finally at 9 pm well apparently i slept so hard that i didn't wake up to let my dog out or feel when he moved from the bed or wake up to go pee my dog had  two accidents in the house that my brother found and cleaned up but had to make the comment that  i am  an irresponsible pet owner (   which no fault of his own but my ex would use my love for animals to twist me around saying i was a horrible pet owner ) I finally had it and i told them that i  wont be back to Kentucky. Friday my mom comes to talk to me and we agree that i will stay in WI and come down in summer and we can rent me a place .. so now im in WI once again i drove it all and we get to Wisconsin and my mom tells me that she cant live with me because im too messy ....at this point im so numb and i just nod my head and move the conversation to what we still need to be done.  I told my mom when dad passes i will need her i cant be this alone anymore up here in WI and all i cant think of is my brother got to be with dad and say goodbye and now he gets to have my mom to grieve but who do i have.

2. She ended her last relationship last summer and told me that she doesnt want a bf rn.

1ihmctn,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1ihmctn/watched_mitchum_talking_with_rory_with_my_wife/,"Watched Mitchum talking with Rory with my wife, and she said...","""Mitchum was right!""  

...now, this isn't me asking for relationship advice, because I thought he was right too, and it's always good to see that we're still on the same page about the crucial issues after 20 years of marriage. (If you don't know this story arc, quit reading! spoilers ahead).  

\----

So, I know it's been a bone of contention on this sub whether Mitchum's evaluation right about Rory, whether he could have been nicer, and whether he gave her a fair shot. Well, we just binged right up past there. Between the re-watch and talking with my wife, I'm even more certain now that Mitchum was right, AND moreover, that he did right.  

Let's review the facts. Rory was blindsided by Mitchum's father and wife, who clearly expected Logan to marry a woman who had been raised to be a ""corporate wife,"" as Lorelai once described Emily. Someone who'd manage the household, the charities, the social calendar, etc. NOT a career gal. What we don't know is whether Mitchum agrees or if he just disapproves of how rude they were about it. 

Either way, he goes out of his way to drop by at Yale and apologize to Rory face to face. Well, he tells her ""You deserve an apology,"" but never actually says he's sorry. Instead, he lets his actions speak, and does that rich people thing where they don't *say* their apologies, they *pay* them. In this case, with a valuable internship.   
  
But then does Rory actually *fail*?  Yes, and how! 

a) Day one, he tells her to shadow him while he's in town. Clear instructions: stick with him, see what he does, and learn the ropes \[of HIS job, a newspaper exec\]... but she botches it. She loses him right away, for one (granted, that's probably a bit of humor, but it's also a Chekov's screw-up), but then she won't even follow him into a room! After a few \*days\* he literally has to invite her into the meeting room behind closed doors. Some shadow...

b) A few days in, and she's set up... a cubicle where she's helping everyone out as a gopher (a lackey you send to ""go for"" this or that). A very organized gopher, but a gopher nonetheless. It's low-level work, even for an intern, but especially for someone meant to shadow the boss. The CEO doesn't hide away in a cubicle, and certainly not someone who might become a Huntzberger.

c) She gets one last chance at a staff meeting, where she meekly sits in the corner, dutifully taking notes. To test her ambition, Mitchum sets up a juicy beat for any young journalist: The newspaper needs someone to cover the arts scene in freakin' New York City. It's not a question of funding, Mitchum sees to it right there in front her. He shooes away a staffer who says he can do it, and TURNS AROUND to look at Rory while he does so, saying they could ""go to universities, Yale, whatever,"" for volunteers to cover it... ""Those kids jump at the chance."" She's one of ""those kids!"" He couldn't have telegraphed ""This is yours, kid, take it"" any more clearly without spelling it out. 

d) It was right after this meeting that he sits down to tell her that it isn't going to work. The link is that clear. If she's going to pass up sweet, juicy low-hanging fruit, she's not going to strive for the hard-to-reach stuff higher up the tree. That's all he needs to know.

e) Should he have been more explicit? No. When you don't give people instructions, the true nature of their ambition comes out. It's like when people get drunk--- they forget life's instructions and their true selves emerge. *In vino veritas.* Rory's true nature was to wait for things to come her way. But the thing about journalism is: You can't reply on your reporters to wait for people in charge to spell things out, or sit around for opportunity to land in their lap. They have to see the opportunities nobody wants to show them... and TAKE them.  Especially if they want to be reporters on serious geopolitical issues. Even for the small-time local puff pieces, or the arts scene. But you have to AT LEAST be the kind of person who pushes first until there's push-back, if not further. If you pre-emptively shy away from conflict, you are going to fail as a serious reporter. 

Mitchum tells Rory she'd make a great assistant, because that's what he \*observed\*: She thinks about what would make other people happy, sometimes even before they do--- like when she used her inside info from Logan to... make sure Mitchum's afternoon coffee was decaf.  We could ALL use a great assistant like that.  Even after this, at the DAR job, she works to scoop out intel to make her grandmother happy. 

Was Mitchum fair to Rory? We thought so. But even if you think otherwise, was it fair that she was even given the internship? Unfairness giveth, and unfairness taketh away.

My wife pointed out that Paris would not have blown this chance, and that seals the deal for Mitchum being right. Paris would have kicked down the door that the editor shut in Rory's face on day one. She would have never consented to just moving papers around without improving them to everyone's chagrin. She wouldn't have had to be asked twice to jump in at the staff meeting. Hell, they would have had to fight to make sure she didn't steal THEIR beats, too. She wouldn't be everyone's friend, true... let's be real, she wouldn't be \*anyone's\* friend. But good reporters go where they aren't wanted.  Otherwise they're just doing PR. Paris on the religion beat at Yale almost got restraining orders put against her. Doyle... was so *proud* of her as an editor. 

So all told, Rory was handed a golden opportunity on a silver platter and she blew it. And honestly we should have seen it coming. Like from day one at college, when she paged her mom in a panic to come back barely 30 minutes after she had left her at Yale. Even for a nervous college student, that was ridiculous. She even bemoans this fact at that time, that Christiane Amanpour \[her role model\] wouldn't call her mommy from the trenches. But it's who Rory is, and that's partly why we love her. 

Mitchum was right about Rory, and he did do her a favor by ripping off the bandaid like he did. She just ""don't got it"" when it comes to being a hard-nosed reporter. Personally I think she would have been fine as the editor of a small-city newspaper, not just an assistant. Assigning beats, organizing logistics, keeping everyone calm at every level of the organization, that sort of thing. Or nowadays she'd make a wonderful podcaster. But she's no Woodward or Bernstein.

Anyways, maybe you agree maybe you don't, but my wife and I agree with each other, so we're all good.   ",35,1738688248.0,GilmoreGirls,13,0.83,False

Message of hope.,"I'm a male, 46 years old and been suffering for about 13 years with urinary issues. Frequent peeing, not a full bladder... Lots of pain and really bad pain after any form of sex or masterbation. All the classic food, dietary triggers and very surprising many pharmaceutical drugs cause horrific urine retention eg most blood pressure meds all all types of antidepressants.
It's totally ruined my life, career and made me incredibly suicidal..

I managed it poorly with cannabis... And then pain killers after the cannabis caused horrific mental health issues.

Like many of you... I've been searching the internet for answers. Tried everything. Nothing worked.

I honestly thought I had IC as the diet was very helpful. About 8 years ago seen a urologist. Was scoped in the bladder (cystoscopy), urine dynamic... All came back clear. Tried tamulsom (flowmax) but never really helped. Was fobbed off by the urologist to see the pain clinic... Which I never felt was the answer and never went. 

The last 6 years a GP gave me zapain (codine and paracetamol) which helped... But always wore off... Sometimes never touched it. She also started me on doxazosin which helped... The dose increased... But it never really got rid of it... But helped stopped my bladder going crazy. Pain and frequency was always an issue. 

I did this for years with having breakdowns and going off sick... Unable to sleep and work... Zero social life. 

Now I've been misdiagnosed many times with other chronic health conditions... And I've gone private and got answers. 
So I thought about seeing a urologist privately who had over 30 experience and many positive reviews. 
I thought... What the hell... Pay the money... See what he thinks. 

Very, very quickly after asking me some questions and looking at my past test results diagnosed with with pelvic floor dysfunction.
In particular.. Tight pelvic floor. 

I burst into tears hearing someone who was 100% sure of what I had. I was given 10mg Alfuzosin... Which sadly didn't work.. Caused urine retention... But went back to 6mg doxazosin.
And a list of pelvic floor exercises... Which I'll put the link on the bottom of the post.
I've been doing that exercises every day and really concentrating on belly breathing through out the day... And mindful of how I hold my pelvic floor. He said it may take months to get better. After about three weeks... My bladder is almost normal. 

I'm peeing about 6 times a day. Rarely getting up in the middle of the night. Pain is 90% better... Sometimes my bladder feels a little weird and achy. Able to masterbated... No horrific pain afterwards. 
I'm back to drinking coffee... And even tried vaping... No issues. 

It's fucking life changing. 

What caused this? We don't know. About 13 years ago i became incredibly fit... Huge body changes. I also have been through incredibly stressful events. And I didn't know but was battling undiagnosed Anklosing Spondylitis. We'll never know what it was. I'm aware stress is a big player with this.

I feel that I'm going to relapse... But it appears to be going well. 

I'm incredibly upset with the first urologist for not knowing or suggesting this to me... I'm really pissed off with so many wasted years. But equally thankful that I did pursue a second opinion and found a very brilliant urologist privately... He literally diagnosed me in 5 minutes. 

I never thought I'd get rid of this and was about to start medical cannabis and accept a very poor and sickly life. 

There is hope. 

Here are the excercises I was given. 

I hope this gives other men out there hope. I really beat myself up to what I might of done to my body to of caused this...I can now start to move forward and guilt free.

Recently me and my wife got our first ever esspresso machine - delonghi dedica arte (one with fancy milk foam making thing).

We get our coffee preground for ""esspresso"" from a pretty good local coffee specialty shop/cafe.

Sometimes, it only drips several drops, the lights flicker and stops. Sometimes, it does flow, but the flow is very limited, drop by drop, it accumulates in over a minute or so and then it stops. The crema is also varied accordingly, so is the taste. There are occasions, when the coffee it makes is heavenly, somtimes it's just ok and sometomes, it is very bland or watery.

I'm at a loss as to why this happens and don't know what to do. Maybe I need to have the coffee stirring needle device? Maybe I don't compress the coffee with the same force each time? Can putting slightly different amounts affect the flow? What could I be dping wrong? The grind is consistent at least and the fact that sometimes it is very good and sometimes outright stops, makes me think it's my fault.

Thanks in advance. I'm attaching a video showcasing the usual drippy, poor flow.",1,1738687960.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

In these past 100 days I’ve managed to lose 28.6lbs.  I’ve also been reminded on why tacking my intake is so important for me. Here are my three main takeaways.

First, If you are a forgetful creature like me it’s probably pretty likely you might be eating extra calories your brain didn’t even register. When I wasn’t logging it was pretty easy for me to remember my main meals in a day but the handful of nuts, big glug of cream in my coffee, or a treat from the break room at work left my mind pretty much immediately after it passed my lips. Those extra calories added up. 

Second, my brain got caught up in portion distortion. I couldn’t figure out why my weight was creeping up. I felt like my portion sizes hadn’t gotten any bigger, but once I started measuring again I realized that my meals had steadily been getting bigger. It happened so slowly that I didn’t notice. But once I was holding myself accountable by logging I was able to reset my mindset on 

Third, I can truly eat anything and lose weight. The caveat is that things should be eaten in moderation and factored in as part of your daily calorie budget. Yesterday I had a sub from Jimmy John’s for lunch. I was craving that sub for a couple of days. I was able to work it into my calorie budget because I only ate half and knew I was having a healthy dinner. My sandwich was delicious. I was happy and my craving was satisfied. My weight was even down 0.2lbs this morning. Logging my food does give me freedom to eat what I want and still lose weight. I still eat plenty of “bad” foods and I still lose weight. I’d be miserable if I was resigned to eating nothing out plain chicken breast and broccoli everyday. Knowing I can still work my favorite foods into my regular rotation makes staying on my diet much easier mentally. Hell, most days I eat a couple of cookies before bedtime. It’s all about CICO for me. 

The point of me writing this novel was to let everyone know that tracking your intake is a great way to hold yourself account to ensure you aren’t accidentally sabotaging your own weight loss efforts. I personally use the MFP app because thats just the one I’m most comfortable using. I probably spend around 5-10 minutes a day logging all my meals and snacks and checking my progress chart. I know it isn’t viable for everyone but for those of you on a CICO journey I really do think it’s one of the biggest keys to long term success. ",8,1738687852.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

I know times seem like shit right now. I m feeling affected too, I wouldn't lie. 

But a contrary reality I also see is that people that are against all of this shitfuckery are also being more outspoken. 

I live in a suburban semi conservative kinda place. I had been out and about presenting femme all the time before the elections, I do so after. I didn't see the ground reality change in terms of the people around. Those that were nice became nicer but those that were assholes still remain assholes lol 😆. 

I know legally, it's like the government is hell bent on wiping our identities in terms of ID laws and what not but ur ID doesn't determine ur actual physical existence, remember that... 

I would say, just exist, exist out and about in public spaces.... do it within the bounds of safety but do go out... be visible, be existent. Don't be all confrontational unless needed, just go out..

Dress nice, glam up, get ur best face on and go... maybe for a drink, for a coffee, for dinner idk.. whatever u prefer... just go out...

Of all the people rage baiting around trans people, 99% of them do not even know a single trans person in their entire social circle. Challenge their reality shaped by crazy media about trans people being some crazy species by simply going out and doing ur thing.

Three weeks ago, she had a sinus infection for which she was given antibiotics. Ever since then, she hasn't really eaten anything, throws up several times a day, and sleeps all day and all night. She sleeps so much that to get all her treatments in, she has done them back-to-back.
Fast forward to this last Friday and she went to her dialysis appointment.  When they found out about her vomiting they made her go to the er. The er made her stay until Sunday. They said the antibiotics most likely upset her gi. They said he kidneys are at a 4 now. Which I'm also confused about. 

After she came home, her vomiting worsened despite taking anti-nausea medication.  She is throwing up coffee-colored vomit. She will not eat anything, and vomits up anything she drinks. I kept telling her we needed to return to the hospital because her vomiting was worsening and she had stomach pains.

I Came home from work today (I work nights) and she was on the bathroom floor, naked, hugging the floor.  She kept crying for help but wouldn't let me take her to the hospital. She had bruises all over from crawling on the floor.

I need some suggestions and tips.,"So I’m 25, just under 5’ and tend to fluctuate between 118-120lbs. I cook for myself and my boyfriend so we tend to eat the same which can be difficult as my caloric needs are a lot lower than his. He is 6’2” and just under 200lbs and works a physically laborious job so it seems like he just burns everything. 

I try and skirt around by trying to eat smaller portions so we can still enjoy the same meals at dinner and typically I’ll pack my own lunches for work. 
Breakfasts consist of either an instant oatmeal packet for convenience and because it fills me up, or a fruit option. Some mornings my coffee fills me up enough and my appetite is curbed where all I need is an apple sauce pouch or protein bar around 11:30a to survive until lunch time.

I work as a receptionist and office assistant so I don’t get as many steps in as I used to. I try to get up and walk a lap around the floor I’m on every so often to get some activity in. 
Since I’m getting back into fitness I’m starting small at home. I’ll lift 5lb dumbbells and do some light upper body, lower body, and ab workouts. Usually 1-2 reps to failure per workout and I try to activate different muscles in each group. 

Is muscle memory really a thing when you haven’t worked out in years?
What do you do to maximize food enjoyment while minimizing calories? 
What did it take to get over the wall and finally hit your goals?

I always felt most confident between 100-110lbs and had the most energy then. 
I would love to get back down to 110 and put on some muscle and feel energized and strong again. I also think I carry my weight fairly evenly but I have a small frame I think because I still fit comfortably into a US XS or 0-2?

**A Day in the Life of the Puerto Rican in Space**     
     
The morning light spilled through the grand windows of La Fortaleza, casting golden streaks across the polished stone floor. Sebastián sat at the head of the long mahogany table in the council chamber, the scent of brewed coffee thick in the air. His advisors, ministers, and security chiefs gathered around, their datapads brimming with reports.

""Let's begin,"" Sebastián said, flipping through the first briefing on his screen. ""Power grid status?""

Engineer Omar Castillo cleared his throat. ""The turbines in Carolina are running at ninety-two percent efficiency. The desalination plants are keeping pace with demand, but we’ve noticed a dip in output near Fajardo. A routine check found sediment buildup in the intake valves. It’s being addressed, but we might want to allocate funds for more frequent maintenance.""

Sebastián nodded. ""Make it a priority. Water and power—nothing functions without them.""

Next came the Mars Freehold border. The Spanish delegation had been pressing harder, encroaching on Freehold territory under the pretext of security patrols. The governor of the Martian district had sent a communique requesting firmer action.

""Any direct provocations?"" Sebastián asked.

""Nothing overt,"" replied Lord Adrián Solano, his tone measured. ""But their ships linger longer than usual near our trade routes. It could be posturing. It could be something more.""

Sebastián exhaled slowly. ""Keep watch. Inform our Martian governor that we are monitoring developments and will respond accordingly if their sovereignty is threatened. We can’t afford distractions while we’re disentangling from Union sovereignty.""

At the mention of disentanglement, Isabella Vélez-Campo, the chief negotiator of Puerto Rico’s separation from the universal church, leaned forward.

""Progress continues, but certain financial institutions are dragging their feet,"" she reported. ""They're reluctant to release full control over assets that were once funneled through the Vatican's economic structures. They’re making it bureaucratically painful.""

Sebastián smirked. ""Expected. But pain can be shared."" He tapped his fingers against the table. ""Make it known that we’re also reviewing the tax codes for foreign entities operating in our jurisdiction. See if that loosens their grip.""

There were murmurs of approval from the council. The game was one of pressure and counterpressure.

Discussion shifted to the mood of the duchies. While most were secure under his rule, whispers of discontent still emanated from certain quarters. Opposition figures were organizing quietly, cautious but persistent.

""Nothing actionable yet,"" reported Elena Morales, head of intelligence. ""But they’re watching your every move, looking for a misstep.""

Sebastián smiled. ""Then we give them nothing to seize upon.""

The meeting wound down with logistical updates—commerce at New San Juan Port had increased, but smuggling attempts had also risen. Patrols would need reinforcement. The embassy complex had seen a surge in diplomatic visits, another sign that Puerto Rico was solidifying its position on the world stage.

Finally, as the sun dipped lower in the sky, Sebastián dismissed the council. He walked the familiar halls of La Fortaleza alone, his steps measured.

The Ordinance Vault was beneath the old palace, a relic of past conflicts and future necessities. Security granted him passage without question. Inside, amidst the carefully stored weaponry and historical artifacts, rested the recently retrieved Blade of Harmony.

Recovered from a stabilized and preserved Deepwater Horizon Spill site, the weapon represented more than just steel—it was the weight of responsibility, a burden that had been forged on Harmony before finding its way here.

Sebastián ran his fingers along the hilt. His sensibilities on order had brought stability. But stability was fragile thing.

In the quiet of the vault, he whispered a promise, not to his people, nor his council, but to himself, as he shut the case that held the sword.

**No missteps. No weakness. Only forward.**

Switched out open/close switch on brew basket and it's still brewing this close to the top of the filter everytime I do 69g of coffee.

Have tried everything else. Grinder setting is their recommendation of 6 on KM5 grinder. Using MM filters.

FWIW, a couple months ago, before this problem started, I was doing 1200g water and 75g of coffee and starting the brew with the basket closed. Let it bloom for 30ish seconds, mix with spoon, then open basket. Never had any overflow issues doing this until 2 months ago. No known changes at that time either!

He told me that he found this girl interesting and wanted to get to know eachother. That really crossed my boundaries and I got really sad and insecure about it. I told him how i felt and he didnt even apologize, he just said that im overthinking and that im insecure. I mean yes, im insecure, but i at least could’ve gotten an apology or reassurence. Then he started saying how even if he wanted to, he wouldnt cheat on me because he was a “christian man with values” and instead he was afraid that I will cheat because I loved sex…Anyway after that whole thing i got really mad at him and told him that i needed some space, especially because I have an exam week and am stressed and I didnt need even more stress from him. Anyway one of my friends from high school who moved away was back in my home city and asked me to hang out. I was really tired of studying so I said yes. I even told my bf I was going to hang out with her but told him probably 1 hour max. It turned out that other of my girl friends from high school came as well and I ended up staying for 3 hours. Btw this wasnt at a club or something, just for a coffee hangout. Afterward he asked me how long I stayed and I said 3 hours and he got mad. Saying how I chose them over him and how i didnt love him. I then said that I just wanted to see my friends and that I needed a little space for a week. Then he started saying how people dont ask for space from people they love and started accusing me of not loving him…then I got mad at HIM for being mad at such a normal situation. I then told him whenever he gets better to text me and he hasnt texted me for 3 days. How can i handle this? Idk if i was the mean one here and should apologise. Pls help

And successful case to report,"I want to ask about people's experiences with nortriptyline, specifically at 10 mg (low-dose) or less. It's supposed to be more tolerable than amitriptyline but I want to get some first-hand experiences. In particular I'm interested if it causes or worsens constipation (and how that is relative to amitriptyline), heartburn, reflux, nausea, and whether it exacerbates anxiety on start up.

My mom has been using nortriptyline 10 mg successfully for two weeks so far and now thinks she is essentially in remission. She said for a few days she felt temporarily dizzy an hour after taking it but that's worn off. Also she said that coffee no longer makes her anxious. Her problems are similar to mine but less severe, and would also be of the post-prandial distress syndrome variety (I guess you could say this supports the genetic predisposition hypothesis).

While I personally have improved quite a bit, I am still far from normal. Tandospirone was helping a lot but seemed to be causing acid reflux, which is now a problem, so I had to go off that. So now I'm considering alternatives. SSRIs seem appealing for their reduction in overall GI transit time, and the large dosing range of sertraline and fluoxetine make those seem easier to to experiment with. TCAs seem dubious because they've made me worse in the past and I believe that's largely because they can greatly slow digestion (same happened on mirtazipine). So I'm wondering if Nortriptyline might somehow improve motility while its TCA cousins don't.

1ihltq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1ihltq5/my_keto_bible/,My keto bible,"I wrote this a few years ago, but I’ve never shared it here. Maybe it will help someone! 

Let me know what you would add (or what you respectfully disagree with)! 

This is everything you need to know to start keto, and contributions from our members on things they wish they knew before they started: 

* Keto is short for ketogenic which means “creating ketones” 

* The Ketogenic diet is a standard of 5% carbs, 25% protein, 70% fats, but some people vary the macros based on needs. Generally, if ketosis is your goal, you need to stay at 5% or less carbs. (Macro calculator: https://calculo.io/keto-calculator, set to sedentary activity and a 20% calorie deficit) 

* Total Carbs - Fiber - Sugar Alcohols/Erythritol = Net Carbs! Your carb macro is NET, not total! :) 

* The keto diet is NOT safe for some diabetics and other people with certain conditions, please consult with your doctor before starting this or any diet/lifestyle change

* Your HEALTH is the point of a lifestyle change. If keto doesn’t work for your body, that is OKAY! Don’t sacrifice your health for a title or label when that was the goal to begin with.

* The keto diet IS a lifestyle change. You will gain the weight back if you switch back to a high-carb diet like the Standard American Diet (SAD diet) 

* Keto is a lifestyle, and as such, you cannot rely solely on Slimfast “keto” products. If you’re going to be keto/low-carb for life, then you have to learn to live that way, even on the toughest days with the least time. Sometimes that is a Quest Bar and a fat bomb, but balance is necessary for nutrition.

* You can gain/lose up to 7 POUNDS of water weight PER day and this is especially apparent in your first week, and after cheat days! 

* Keto Flu is completely avoidable if you get enough electrolytes. Get your sodium through drinking broth and adding salted butter and salt to your foods. Get your potassium with avocado or dark leafy greens. Unsweetened cacao also has some. Magnesium is *easiest* to get through a supplement. DRINK WATER. 

* Cheat days are not the end of the world, they will NOT make you gain back every ounce you’ve lost, and in my opinion they make special occasions a little more special. Plus, no LIFESTYLE is treat-less, that’s ridiculous! 

* There’s a difference between strict and dirty keto, but it comes down to your goals: if you want to lose weight, dirty keto is fine! If your goal is anti-inflammatory, strict keto is more up your alley. 

* “Dirty” keto uses artificial sweeteners, trace amounts of wheat and sugar, but keeps you within macros and calories! 

* Strict keto avoids all sweeteners, gluten, beans and legumes, dairy, and most grains for anti-inflammatory purposes as well.

* Both methods will put you into ketosis which is the state where your body uses fat as a fuel source instead of carbohydrates/glycogen. 

* Things that will kick you out of ketosis- more than 20g (or your limit) net carbs in a day, & MALTITOL, an evil “sugar alcohol” that effects your blood sugar more than table sugar! 

* Things that will not kick you out of ketosis - 2g of sugar, one cracker/chip/bite of something “bad” (just count these as 2g+ carbs per piece depending on the item), eating too much protein- a common misconception!! 

* Eat your fats early in your day to help you feel full longer - bulletproof coffee, butter/avo with your eggs and bacon/sausage

* You WILL have setbacks and ITS OK. Just hop back on the train! We are all human

* You will lose water weight faster than fat. Don't let it discourage you if you lose 5-10lbs quick then it slows to about .5lbs per 1-2 days. This is normal and HEALTHY.

* Don't forget to eat fiber or you will feel bloated/backed up! 

* Water is a MUST, if you want to lose, you’ve gotta give your body enough water to maintain itself so you’re not holding onto excess 

* Weight during your period DOESNT COUNT. Just don’t do it, you’ll be fluctuating so often, it’s not worth the stress! 

* Take measurements, take pictures, TAKE THEM. You’ll want them for proof! 

* Change is HARD to see and accept in ourselves - trust others when they say you’re looking good! 

* The second or third time starting keto is often a LOT easier for people because they have more knowledge and/or more support! Never be discouraged by this! 

* Egg fasts, ketosis strips, exogenous ketones, and “keto cookbook/28 day program”’s are among the biggest MONEY GRABS of this trending lifestyle change. They’re not at all necessary, and can be unpleasant and a waste of time. 

* When in doubt, ASK ASK ASK! This group is full of nothing but wonderful people because that’s the kind of people we let in, and we’re ready to help. We’ve got two admins and a lot of great minds! 

* Also, google! Trust it! Just search “ _______ carbs” and make sure that you have either net carb info or carb and fiber info! 

* Hard alcohol has no carbs but does have calories! 

* Breastfeeding mothers shouldn’t do keto, but modified low-carb as they are at risk of ketoacidosis.

* Intermittent fasting is NOT necessary, but it is a great option and can often help people get through stalls, and lose more weight in general. People also report feeling more satisfied with their meals/satiety levels.

* Satiety = not being hungry. Fat = satiety because in ketosis, your body is using ketones as a fuel source. Ketones are fat based. The ketones your body uses for fuel will come from your food AND your bodies fat storage

* Eat when you’re hungry, but try your best to get 1200 calories a day. Starvation mode is still a real concern and can even stall your weight loss, but your body is using your extra fat storage when you’re not hungry so 🤷🏼‍♀️ listen to your body and do what feels best. 

* If you exercise, you need to watch to make sure you’re not feeling faint. Exercising on ketones is way harder. 

* I cannot stress enough, drink the water. 

* Fats need to be healthy fats. Avocado, coconut, peanuts, almonds, macadamia nuts, butter, etc. Ideally, not vegetable/canola oils, etc. 

* Carbs should be mostly healthy choices as well, that are high in fiber. Veggies, berries, nuts... 

* SugarFree Jello is great for a sweet tooth.

* Lakanto is the BEST no carb sweetener. 

* Zero sugar sodas taste better than diet sodas.

* Bunless burgers, tortilla-less tacos and burritos, lunchables sans crackers, there’s a ton of easy snacks and meals out there! 

* Portioning out condiments and snacks ahead of time can help you stay on track and make everything easier! 

* Using an app to track your weight and meals is VERY helpful - carb manager and myfitnesspal are two good choices 

* Weighing yourself everyday is a fast-track to obsession, anxiety, and depression. Pick one day a week, and stick to it. Pay attention to your cycles if you’ve got an active uterus. ",19,1738686954.0,keto,11,0.91,False

My wife and I recently welcomed our baby into the world. Due to work schedules and wanting to babystep roadtrips for our newborn, we're trying to find a spot mid-wayish between Antigo and Milwaukee for a meetup. 

We're looking for: 
Comfy seating and chairs with backs (for grandparents and recovering mom);
A space that would be willing to have a newborn; 
A space that will let us hang out for ~4 hours or so

Nice to have: a place that lets us bring in food. It's my parents anniversary and they want specific food.

I am thinking a cozy brewery or coffee shop.  For Milwaukee equivalents like Black Husky, Enlightened, Mobcraft or Rochambo Coffee

lused the bottomless for the first time today and it was pretty messy, and it looked like my shots weren't as good as I thought they were without being able to actually see it.

I have individually messed around with things like grind size, tamper pressure, grind amount before getting the bottomless and thought I was pretty dialed in for double shots. The pull in the video was about 27 or so seconds long.

Anyone have any suggestions to make it less messy?",2,1738686708.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I'm going to be traveling in London for 10 days.

Some facts:

I do not need to budget for accommodations as I will be staying with a friend. 

Likely will not be eating out everyday as I will be mostly cooking at my friends place. But do plan on getting some fish and chips and some kebab fries and lunch with a couple friends. 

The only ""activity"" I would like to do is to go on the London eye. But I mostly just plan to walk around and take in the sights and visit friends and go to coffee shops and libraries. I do plan on going to the Camden markets but I doubt I will buy anything and if I do it would just be something small or a T-shirt or something (I don't usually buy souvenirs). 

This isn't because I don't have money to spent but genuinely just will be there to visit friends and get away for a little bit. This is also how I typically travel. 

My only additional travel expense (besides the train and flights) is a pet sitter which is costing me $150USD (thankfully my friend offered to dog sit). 

I've already purchased my flights to and from and I'm not counting that in my budget for my time there.

With these things in mind how much would you budget for? 

If I stretched it I would like to not spend any more than $1000 USD but ideally would like to remain under $750USD if possible. Do you think this is doable? ",1,1738686574.0,uktravel,7,1.0,False

Am I doing okay?,"I remember when McDonald’s was added to Uber Eats and DoorDash, that is definitely where my habits took a turn for the worst. I used to order food every single day for breakfast lunch and dinner. From the age of 22 to 26 (I am currently 26), I was addicted to ordering food. I moved out of my parents house at 22 and from then on I didn’t want to make my own food. I was ordering Wendy’s, McDonald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, every bad fast food chain you can possibly think of. As of January, I have attempted to go food shopping cook for myself and stop ordering! 

Please tell me if what I eat on a day-to-day basis is OK

For breakfast, I usually eat a banana with a yogurt, maybe a ham and cheese, sometimes I make pancakes or French toast or omelettes. This morning for breakfast I had a banana, a kiwi watermelon and an iced coffee. 

For lunch, I usually eat a ham sandwich, or chicken pot pie (frozen) or a bagel sandwich, sometimes I eat leftover pasta that I made, or I get a quick bite either at Panera bread or a sandwich spot. I love sandwiches.  

For dinner, I’ve been eating pastas, a lot of grilled chicken, sometimes I’ll have Ramen noodles with boiled eggs, sometimes I’ll have tacos or maybe if I’m not feeling too hungry a hot pocket and I really like to make breakfast for dinner sometimes as well. 

For dessert (which I have every night) I’d either have chocolate chip cookies with whole milk (I drink whole milk every night) maybe a slice of cheesecake if I have some, maybe some chips or an ice cream sandwich. Most of the time, I bake cookies. Almost every night. I get the mini nestle chocolate chip, and since I live alone, I only really eat like six… I only bake as much as I’ll eat. 

Someone recently told me that I’m very unhealthy and I eat a lot of unhealthy foods but how do I change that? I really feel like I don’t eat unhealthy but please let me know what you think below. 

For reference, I am 26 years old, a female, I am 5 feet tall, the lowest weight I’ve been was 96 pounds and the heaviest I’ve been was 130. I am currently 124 pounds. Another thing I might add is I’ve always had trouble gaining weight, since I was a kid I was put on vitamins and special milks in order to put on pounds. This has followed me into adulthood so if I do not eat three meals a day with some snack snacks in between I lose weight very fast.

We’re coming up on 10 years of marriage, and if there’s one thing I’ve realized, it’s this: Marriage isn’t always romance and butterflies—it’s teamwork, patience, and choosing each other every single day.

It’s laughing at the same inside jokes for years, arguing over what to eat, saying “I’m sorry” even when it’s hard, and supporting each other through every high and low. It’s the little moments—the quiet coffee mornings, the “text me when you get there” check-ins, and the way you just *know* what the other person is thinking.

Marriage isn’t perfect, but it’s real. And after almost a decade, I wouldn’t trade it for anything. ❤️

I go to local kink sloshes and munches and yet every time I almost always gravitate to the women and NB folk since I just get too anxious to talk to men.  I went to a pup night at a local queer bar to explicitly talk to other gay guy pet players there, and yet I still wound up only chatting with the minority of women there.  I was wearing a full on furry tail and wolf ears and shaking my ass and I still couldn’t bring myself to seriously converse with a single guy there.  One guy wanted to get a drink for me but he didn’t know I was trans and I didn’t know if accepting the drink meant as a sign I was interested and so I panicked and declined.  I managed to tell a guy I thought he danced pretty well and then I practically ran away after because I was too nervous.  I saw him later at another event after and he recognized me and I wanted to die.

It’s cisgender gay guys specifically.  I’m 23 and FTM and I can talk to other trans and gender queer people with ease.  I’m chill with lesbians.  Less so with cis het people but it’s not that big a deal, I can make conversation.  But I just have this crippling inability to talk to the gay guys I’m actually interested in and I feel so stupid about it.

I guess I’m just not sure what to do about it.  I have a fair idea of what’s causing the problem, but I don’t know how to address it.  Full disclosure, I’m
mostly on the prowl for intimate friendship.  I don’t have it in me to commit to a full relationship but I do crave someone who I can trust and chill with and who I can also get my freak on with.  

On the one hand, I generally have a major fear of intimacy.  I literally let a guy chain me to a Saint Andrew’s cross and beat me with floggers and yet I couldn’t bring myself to cuddle with him, despite wanting to.  I just couldn’t feel comfortable with it despite wanting it.  Part of it I think is just being essentially a huge virgin who was raised Catholic and growing up with extremely restrictive ideas of what types of intimate touch are okay, but another part is definitely my transness.  

I’m so scared that no matter what I do, I’m just wasting everyone’s time since most gay guys who are into trans guys typically just have them as a disappointing second pick.  I know I’m going to get rejected a lot, it’s just statistics, but at the same time I know that the biggest reason for those rejections is going to be because of my body.  What then?  When do I disclose?  Before things get intimate?  After the first meeting?  The first time we lock eyes?  Typically what I do the extremely few fleeting times I have been able to talk with other guys, I’ve just given them my FetLife profile, and right there is my identity listed as a trans male and a pinned post that details my anatomy, how I use/refer to it etc, and they can decide if it’s worth it from there.  Of course, the few times I have spoken with other guys, they’ve all turned out to be straight. 

I’m also open about my identity on Grindr and Scruff but I just don’t know if I’m doing it right.  On the one hand, I don’t like having it being one of the first things I list about myself constantly since it’s kinda objectifying in a way and I’ve gotten a lot of chasers as a result too, but also, I know that if it’s going to be such a big deal for a lot of folks then might as well get it out of the way ASAP?  I just don’t know.

Lord it does not help that the few times I have gotten positive attention on Grindr for instance i almost immediately get too anxious the moment someone mentions meeting up someplace even if it’s just like getting a coffee or a drink or something.  I want to actually meet people I think I already click well with, but the moment the act of actually meeting up is brought up I panic as if I’m getting hunted for sport.  

And good god this is not even touching on my relationship ruminations that so often have me questioning how they perceive my gender and my body and if they really see me the way I want to be perceived or if they just look at me the same way a straight guy looks at a woman??  I’ve had top surgery, been on T for 3 and a half years, and eventually want meta, but I still don’t know if it’s enough.  I feel like i just can’t ever mentally catch a break even when I have a good time practically in my lap.

On top of this, I suffer from migraines. I also throw up every time I get one. Now that I can’t have my medication, I just have to suffer for 48-72 hours. And no, I can’t take Tylenol because I’m allergic to it.  My biggest trigger for migraines is skipping caffeine. The problem is, coffee is DISGUSTING and even the smell makes me nauseous. Same thing with tea. So I’ve been drinking a can of V8 energy every day because otherwise I literally cannot function. I feel so guilty drinking it but if I can’t tolerate anything else.

it was with the watcher, though no infinites or anything like that.

i picked up coffee dripper after beating the act 2 boss and entered the first act 3 boss fight vs donu and deca with just 16 hp. i figured i would probably just die on the first turn, but i somehow managed to win in 6 turns only taking 5 damage. i dont remember much of the fight but i remember i had a huge wrath+tantrum+pen nib combo with some strength for around 150 damage to speed up the fight.

now the second act 3 boss, the awakened one. this fight i enter with just 11 hp. just like the first boss fight, i figured i would probably just die on the first turn, but i somehow managed to win in 7 turns only taking 3 damage. i also dont remember much if this fight, but i remember killing the awakened one with a wrath and tantrum and perfectly setting up pen nib on 9 for next turn where i am guaranteed to draw tantrum again. i remember getting another 150 damage tantrum the first time after the bird awakens and winning shortly after.

to some degree i feel like i didnt deserve it because wrath+pen nib+tantrum did some heavy lifting. but then again, i did survive multiple turns barely taking any damage. it was not just a oneshot.

and of course special shoutout to fasting, the strenght and especially dexterity was a huge reason for being able to avoid dying. picked up 2 energy relics and a clockwork souvenir so i could very safely play multiple copies of this card.

Had started dating in school , we both enjoy playing squash and fencing, but my bf left abroad for undergrad , which is sad and depressing. I am going to meet him soon, just counting down the days 🤞 and my parents are still unaware 😭. I am the youngest among my circle and his parents often call me the lovely good kid , but they are not aware of our relationship and not sure how they would react😭😭. I have been gifted a cute chanel makeup set , photo frame and an earing pair , i am planning to give a handmade dried flowers greeting card, homemade chocolates and soaps,  customised coffee mug and candle lights, and a tapestry ( all handmade ). I am just so excited and happy, what else can I gift my boyfriend? I am a student and hail from a poor household hence can't get money, so are there any mindful and student friendly options other than the above mentioned?

1ihlc4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/retailhell/comments/1ihlc4f/customers_asking_me_to_change_the_music_at_the/,Customers asking me to change the music at the *coffee shop* where I work,"Yes, you read that right. I've been a barista and cashier at this place for a couple months and and twice in the last couple weeks, i've had customers (both middle aged white women) ask me to change the music for them. The first lady asked me to turn the music up because she ""couldn't hear it"" - this is an insane and entitled thing to ask. My coworker explained to her that we cannot control the volume (this is true) of the music. She asked TWO additional times. And then the most recent case, this woman asked us to turn the music down for her and when we said no, she then asked if we could ""play something more mellow.""

In my opinion, asking a fucking coffee shop to change the music to suit your personal preference is so bizarre and entitled that I feel like I almost have a duty to nip it in the bud. Customers have gotten so much more entitled and out of hand since COVID. Not only do I not want to reward that behavior, but I'm also thinking about the other service workers who will have to deal with these women. If I politely say yes (or give in at all really), i'm normalizing that gross behavior and making them feel more comfortable asking other service workers for rude, entitled ""favors.""

It also just blows my fucking mind that anyone could feel comfortable doing that!! It's so entitled and crazy that it crosses over into being embarrassing! And the worst is when someone is being very entitled but asking politely/smiling. Smiling while you do something heinous makes it more heinous, not less! Good god i hate these people",47,1738685742.0,retailhell,34,0.89,False
1ihlbqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ihlbqk/mf_a_totally_normal_day/,[MF] A Totally Normal Day,"A Totally Normal Day

I wake up before the alarm. I do every morning. It's 5:43 AM, and already my heart is racing. For no reason. Nothing has happened yet, but my brain has compiled its list of things to worry about. I take a deep breath. It isn't enough. Another one. Still not enough.
I roll over and check my phone. No messages. No missed calls. That should make me feel better, but it doesn't. Maybe I said something weird in my last text, and that's why no one responded. Maybe everyone's mad at me. I check my messages again, rereading the last conversation. It was fine. Totally normal. I tell myself to stop checking, but I know I'll look again in five minutes. Just in case.
Eventually, the alarm went off at 6:00 AM. Need to get up. Things to do.
Shower first. The water was too hot, but I didn't turn it down. The pain helped me focus, even if only for a few seconds. My mind was loud. I count the tiles on the wall to quiet it down. Thirty-six on this side. Thirty-six on the other. Good. Symmetrical.
I get out and dry off, but I can’t get dressed yet. Not until I lay my clothes out: shirts first, then pants, then sweater, then underwear, then socks, then shoes. Everything must be in order. If not, I just don't know, something bad might happen, I don't know what exactly, just bad.
Once I'm dressed, I head toward the kitchen. Breakfast. Cereal's easiest, but I hesitate at the milk. Did I shake the carton? If I don't it'll go bad. I shake it three times. Not four. Not two. 
My mom goes past, robe still on and hair rumpled from sleeping and gives me this sleep smile ""Morning sweetheart.”
""Morning,"" I reply, trying to sound normal. I think it comes out sounding that way. Still, she hangs around a beat too long. Does she know? Can she tell I haven't slept well? That I woke up drowning already?
She doesn't say anything else, just snatches her coffee and leaves the kitchen. I exhale a breath I hadn't known I was holding.
I have to leave for work soon. My stomach twists just at the thought of it. I love my job-at least, I think I do. It's just people. Talking. Laughing. Watching. What if I say something wrong? What if I do something embarrassing and then don't find out about it later? My brain plays over each and every interaction I've had in the workplace, just looking for mistakes.
I should call in sick.
No. No, I can't. They'll think I'm unreliable if I call in. I'll feel guilty all day if I call in. If I call in, I'll feel like I failed.
So I go.
The drive is uneventful, but I check my rearview mirror a lot. Did I run a red light? Did I cut someone off? I didn't, I know I didn't, but I still have to check. Just in case.
I slap a bright smile on my face as soon as I arrive at work and before going in. I don’t want the pity, nor the concerned glances, neither the awkward questions, ""Is everything okay?"".
I clock in. Deep breath. I can do this.
The morning went well enough, as I do my tasks and chatted to my coworkers enough to be perceived as friendly, not too much as to appear weird. I laughed when I was supposed to, smiled at the right times, and nodded upon talking with people, while my mind had wandered elsewhere.
Lunchtime. I sit outside, away from everyone else. Not because I don't like them, but being with people all morning has siphoned me. I need quiet. I need to breathe.
I check my phone. Still no messages. I know it doesn't mean anything, but my chest tightens anyway. I send a message to my best friend: Hey, how's your day going?
I check immediately for a response. Nothing yet. Obviously. But what if she saw it and didn't want to respond? What if she's mad at me? What if—
The notification pops up. Hey! It's good! How about you?
Relief. A huge wave of it. I reply quickly, trying not to sound too eager.
The rest of the day's a blur. I do what I'm supposed to. I follow my routine. I keep my thoughts in check—mostly. By the time I clock out, I'm exhausted. Not from work itself but from existing. From managing my thoughts, controlling my compulsions, pretending I'm fine.
Same drive home. Had I run a stop sign? Had I hit something without noticing? I’m checking my mirrors more than necessary. Just in case.
The minute I get home, I'm back in the shower. I can’t touch anything in my room until after I’m scrubbed clean. In the shower is when my brain feels the most annoying. Go over everything that you said today, everything you did, did you say something stupid? Did you make somebody mad? Were you acting weird?"" Stuff like that. I try not to think of those things since I know that I'd probably be up into the late night playing it back in my head… Subtle foreshadowing I know. 
I just wanted a normal day. And, in a way, I did. 
Because this is normal. To me.",1,1738685714.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1ihlb6f,https://i.redd.it/54pkuia6d5he1.jpeg,Reactive dog - what’s the trigger?,"We have a chihuahua/spaniel/schnauzer mix, approx. 7 y.o., rescued in 2020. His early life is largely unknown, but we do know he was surrendered several times from the same owner. 
Most of the time, he is an absolute sweetheart. 10% of the time, a couple episodes a week, he is reactive. It’s mostly manageable, but he has bitten my wife and I several times. His whole demeanor shifts, he freezes and his eyes glaze over. The common denominator seems to be resource guarding, but there have been occasions where he isn’t guarding anything. He is protective of our bedroom and in tight spaces (under the coffee table, under the bed). We hired an in-house trainer a couple years ago, but he was of course on his best behavior each time the trainer was over. 
We’re getting serious about addressing this, as we are trying to conceive and fear for the safety of a baby. We bought training material and are working through it daily. We just started crate training at night and limiting his access to our room. We also committed to leashing him to my hip whenever he is not in his crate (a suggestion from trainer). 
My main question is about management while training. I understand that with reactive dogs, we need to reduce triggers at home while we work through training, but how do you manage the trigger when it’s a place, other than limit their access? 
One example of an incident: dog is lying on the bed when my wife makes a somewhat sudden movement to pull a blanket down. He flips out, bites her, retreats to under the bed. No resource involved (other than maybe heated blanket in the vicinity, which he loves). 
I feel like mastering nighttime crating will be a game changer, but it’s been a difficult shift. He cries/barks for over an hour, sometimes so long that we have to give up and let him out. 
Again, he’s not aggressive with other dogs or humans. Can go off leash at our park and won’t bother anyone. If he’s leashed and we approach another dog he will bark or growl, but will say hello and happily move along. He is fearful of big dogs and will attempt to leave the situation or jump into my arms. 
Any advice is appreciated. This dog means so much to me and the thought of choosing between him and a baby makes me sick to my stomach. We are desperate. ",2,1738685672.0,DogAdvice,2,0.76,False
