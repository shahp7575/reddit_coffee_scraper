1ki9s07,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/1ki9s07/does_simplii_financial_have_contactless_payment/,Does Simplii Financial have contactless payment?,"Hello all, 
I'm new here and set myself up with a Simplii chequing account about two weeks ago.  Definitely nice to have no fees (except for e-transfer cancellations), especially since I'm coming from RBC for over 10 years which didn't even offer a minimum amount to maintain in your account to wave monthly fees!

Anyways, as the title asks, does anyone else's Simplii card have the ability to ""tap""?  Or did I just get a dud or something?  I've called them to which they just say they ""turned the feature off and on again"". And no, I'm not trying to make too big of a purchase! It does not matter what the charge is (usually a few dollars, like a coffee, etc).  The machines just beep once and show ""error, please enter chip and pin"".
 Definitely not a big deal, however it sure was a handy convenience with my RBC card! 
If anyone else has dealt with this, or has any idea on how to fix it, please let me know!",1,1746764134.0,PersonalFinanceCanada,0,1.0,False

• She always tell that I am boastful and will get nowhere in life. I was the first one in the family who gets to study in college. I'm studying in a Polytechnic University and I always gets smart shamed. They always tell me that my studies will get me nowhere in life as long as I don't have a good character. Then they always add up that I'm just going to dump them easily once I get successful. 

• There's a time that I'm crying and hurting myself when my father forced his way to get inside of my room. While I'm crying, all they say is that as a parent, they don't have any shortcomings to me. 

• Two days before my pageant as a college sophomore, my mother told me that if such pageant has a Q and A portion, I would win. But, if there's none, the other competitors would win–implicitly telling me that I lack the looks. 

• Days before my pageant in Senior Highschool, my father told me that I looked like a drug addict, body shaming me

• During 8th grade, I'm having breakfast with them. My father told me that I should drink the coffee he prepared for me. I said I don't want to. After that, he shouted that I should drink it as he throw the cup onto the sink. Afterwards, he told me that I am the one who's going to kill him in the future. 


• I have parcels delivered (containing items that I need for my side hustle) and my mother criticized that I have too many parcels when I'm the only one who's paying for those.

• There's a time that a guy was making lascivious face at me in public. I told my father about it and he approached the guy. My mother was mad at me then because she doesn't want my father to be involved in any possible violence out of what I said.

I washed a load of work clothes last night, including my shorts. In order to do this, I had to remove the belt that is part of my dress code. I immediately made a mental note to remember to put my belt on when getting ready for work (1).

Today, as I'm getting out of bed and heading for a shower, I see my work belt (as I walked past it) and remind myself to put it on when I get ready for work (2).

I get my clothes out of the dryer after my shower, walk back to the bedroom to get dressed, see the belt, remind myself to put my belt on (3).

I put on my shirt, deodorant, then shorts and tuck in my shirt. Look at the belt and remind myself to put it on (4).

I WALKED PAST THE BELT to grab my watch, pens, and hair tie. Remind myself to put the belt on before leaving (5).

I sat down to put my socks and shoes on, realize I need to clip a couple of toenails that are a smidge too long for comfort, MOVED THE BELT to get to the nail clippers, reminded myself to put it on after clipping my nails (6) and then put the nail clippers away, leaving the belt where it was.

I grab my phone and keys, close the door to keep the critters out, and start my coffee. Go back into the bedroom--WALKED PAST THE BELT AGAIN and reminded myself again (7)--because I forgot my meds. Take my meds, WALK PAST THE BELT on the way out, close the door, finish making coffee and head out the door.

Now, you would think with SEVEN mental reminders--every time I saw or walked past the belt--I would have put it on, right? WRONG!

I'm driving to work, merrily singing along to my playlist while sipping coffee. Take the appropriate exit from the Interstate and then realize SHIT! I FORGOT MY BELT!!

Slid over two lanes to the right and head to a chain store near work to grab a belt. No time to be picky, so I find one that fits, wrestle the hanger off of it, tear the bar code off and PUT THE BELT ON while waiting to check out. At the register, I handed the cashier the bar code and told her I was wearing the belt.

Buying a new belt was not on my bingo card for the day, but at least it was only $11.",1,1746764008.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

*""She's infected.""*

""There's one coming!"" Lee whispered as loud as he could while he crouched beside the second floor window. ""Get behind the door!""

""Okay!"" Clementine replied and did as she was told, pistol in hand.

""Don't shoot unless I say.""

""I won't.""

Lee waited beside the window for the hunter to crawl through. As the man entered the room, Lee rose to his feet. Once inside he wrapped his arm around the man's neck. Almost instantly, the man shoved him back against the wall, got his own arm between his neck and Lee's arm, and began to shake him loose. At the same time, Lee heard someone else running at him, grunting. He turned in time to slap the knife out of a young girls hand, not without cutting his arm.

""What the fuck?"" Lee questioned at the site of a child with a hunter. This momentary distraction allowed the hunter to flip Lee over his shoulder, onto the floor. The hard impact of the floor was met with even harder punches to the ribs and face.

""Joel!"" The girl cried. Joel kept swinging his fist. ""Joel, stop!""

""Hold on, man!"" Lee shouted, trying to block the blows.

After two more strikes, Joel turned to see the girl. ""Look."" She pointed at Clementine, who had stepped from behind the door, pistol raised.

""Get away from him!"" Clementine demanded.

""Easy, miss."" Joel said, hands up, as he backed in front of his companion. ""Just take it easy.""

""It's okay, Clem."" Lee said, sitting up. ""They're not bad. Lower it."" He took a breath and faced Joel. ""Damn, you could've killed me.""

""Well, that was the idea."" Joel answered.

""Yeah, I thought you were one of them too, but you had her with you. Those assholes don't have kids tagging along.""

""She hurt you!"" Clementine shouted, noticing Lee's arm.

""I'm okay."" Lee assured her. He looked to the strangers in the room. ""I'm Lee, and this is Clementine. I think I heard 'Joel' between the blows to my ear?""

""Ellie."" The girl said, introducing herself.

""How many are with you?"" Joel asked.

""Just us now."" Lee answered. ""Had a bigger group, but it all fell apart.""

""They often do. So what are you two doing out here?""

""Trying to survive. Heading West.""

""Maybe we can help each other?"" Ellie offered.

""Ellie!"" Joel objected.

""What? Safety in numbers and all that.""

""She's not wrong."" Lee added. A large military Humvee could be heard outside. ""Look, we can talk about this at our hideout. We're not safe here.""

""Where is that?""

""Around the corner. Just follow me."" Lee left the room and the rest followed.

""Sorry for almost shooting you."" Clementine said to Ellie. She walked beside her with a limp.

""Don't be. You did good. . . I like your hat."" 

""Thanks, it was my dads.""

""How old are you?""

""Twelve. You?"" 

""Fourteen. Are you hurt?"" Ellie asked, as they descended the stairs.

""What?"" Clementine asked, noticeably rattled.

""You're limping."" Ellie answered. ""Sorry, you don't have to-""

""I broke it."" Clementine interrupted. ""It didn't heal right. It don't really hurt anymore.""

""Oh, well I would have signed your cast.""

""Never had one. Probably why it's like this.""

""Right. . . "" Ellie chuckled, as they exited the house and entered the alley. ""Anyway, where you from?""

""Atlanta, originally,"" Clementine answered, ""but we've lived in Pittsburg for the last couple of years.""

""That's cool. I've been in Boston my whole life.""

""Get down!"" Joel whispered, ducking behind a dumpster. Ellie got behind him while Lee and Clementine took the dumpster on the opposite side. He pointed to the woman in the alley with her back towards them.

""She a hunter?"" Lee asked quietly, his view obstructed.

""No. She's infected."" Joel pulled out his knife. ""Wait here."" Joel sneaked up behind the runner and plunged his knife into her skull. ""All clear."" The others joined him. 

""Nicely done.""

""How much further?""

""In there."" Lee stated, pointed to an apartment building about a block away. The group entered through the back door.  ""There's some canned goods upstairs if you're hungry.""

""I'm okay."" Joel responded as they climbed the stairs. ""Ellie can have mine.""

""You don't have to do that. We have plenty. More than we can take from here.""

""Where you going?""

""Colorado University.""

""Really?"" Joel asked, hiding his suspicion. ""Why there?""

""I uh, was a teacher at Athens."" Lee explained. ""One of my former colleagues is there. Sent word that I should join them.""

""So you're taking your daughter all the way across the country to see an old friend?""

""So what if I am? You got your kid out here too.""

""She ain't my, alright, forget I asked.""

""Look, it doesn't really matter why we're here. We have the same goal. Getting the hell out of here."" Lee approached the window overlooking the town. ""You see that gate before the bridge?"" He pointed to the well guarded gate at the edge of town.

""Yeah.""

""They all gather there to talk about their kills and their finds. It's always like that during the day, but at night there's less than half. That's when we sneak past them.""

""That could work. Or we could do it in the morning. Easier for us to see them. Up to you. ""

""No, we go tonight."" Lee decided. ""It's harder to see them, but it's also harder for them to see us. And I'm not spending another god damn night in here waiting for those assholes to find us. You two are welcome to join us.""

""Okay, then."" Joel agreed, stepping away from the window. ""Sounds like you made up your mind. We better rest up.""

Joel went to the couch to lay down. Two hours passed, feeling like two seconds, before Ellie woke him. It was dark outside and Joel rubbed his eyes before getting up and grabbing his gear. The four of them went downstairs and out the front door. They got onto the street and ducked down behind a concrete barricade. 

""Okay, you two,"" Joel whispered towards Ellie and Clementine, ""Stick together and stay behind us. Me and Lee will clear a path and let you know when to follow.""

""Okay."" Ellie said.""

""Stay right behind her, okay Clem?"" Lee added.

""I will."" Clementine answered.

""Alright,"" Joel resumed, looking at Lee. ""I'll take the left, you take the right.""

""Sounds good.""

The pair matched each others pace as they approached the first gate of the bridge. They steadily walked through the gate and under the construction scaffolding towards two hunters standing near a burning barrel. Joel put the one on the left in a headlock as Lee buried his knife into the one on the right's temple. After a moment of struggle, Joel did the same to his man.

""Nicely done."" Joel complimented.

""Had a lot of practice."" Lee responded. ""Unfortunately.""

The two of them continued on, approaching the hunters from behind two on two, remaining undetected. After each kill, they signaled for the girls to tail them, as they advanced on the next targets. They reached the end of the bridge where the numbers finally caught up to them. Two men sat on a barricade to the left, while another sat on one to the right of the road. Above them, on a scaffold were two more men. All of them armed.

""Fuck, I see five of them. Lee, you got anything quiet to shoot?""

""No man, broke my bow string out hunting a few days ago. Haven't found another.""

""Alright, you take mine,"" Joel said, taking the bow from his back and handing it to Lee, along with some arrows. ""I'm gonna sneak around to the flank those two on the left. When I get up to shoot the first one, you take out the one on the right. That'll take the attention of the ones on top towards me.""

""Works for me.""

""When they start shooting at me, take them out from right to left. If we do it right, they'll never even know you're here."" Lee nodded, and Joel quickly went to the first two soldiers. He looked to Lee and counted down from three with his fingers. The first shot rang out, alerting the rest as the first man fell. The second and third dropped at the same time, one to the bullet, the other to the arrow. Joel crouched behind the barricade as the men above began to fire. One was struck in the elbow with an arrow.

""Fuck!' The hunter shouted, ""Nine o'clock!"" The two turned and fired toward Lee and the girls.

Lee put his arms over the girls and held them to the ground. Joel jumped on the ladder of the scaffold and climbed up, nearly losing his head as he peaked above it.

""Take him out!"" The injured hunter shouted, as he kept firing towards Lee, ""I got the fucker with the bow pinned down!""

Joel waited a moment until the other man had to reload then he joined them on the scaffold. He shot the first man in the chest just as he had his gun reloaded. Joel got behind a crate before the injured man turned his gun towards him. 

""You'll pay for that!"" The injured hunter put three rounds into the crate before needing to reload. Joel stood up, aimed his gun, and saw an arrow enter the mans head, who took one step and fell off the scaffold. 

""Joel!"" Ellie shouted. ""You alive?""

""Yeah, I'm good!"" Joel called back. He climbed down and joined the others as they came to the end of the bridge. ""Nice job, Lee.""

""Yeah, man I'm sorry,"" Lee began, ""I'm a little rusty with it.""

""I wasn't being sarcastic.""

""It's true."" Ellie interrupted. ""He's always serious.""

""Things didn't go to plan, and you looked after the girls. Thank you.""

""Of course, Joel."" Lee accepted. ""I think you'd do the same.""

Joel nodded. ""Let's keep moving. Get a few miles out of this city and we can hole up and get some proper rest and something to eat.""

*""I saw her get bit.""*
___
The team had found a small cabin on the lake to take shelter for the remainder of the night. After a dinner of sardines, and pears for dessert, they all went to sleep. A few hours later, the sun began to peak through the curtains and the survivors began to stir. Joel opted to get more sleep as the others used the time to have some breakfast. Eventually he was awoke again by Ellie's voice.

""What do you call a bear with no teeth?"" Ellie asked, Clementine shrugged. ""A gummy bear.""

""Are they all this bad?"" Clementine laughed. Joel got to his feet.

""No, some are even better. Hold on. . . Oh, this one. Why did the tomato turn red?""

""Please stop.""

""Because it saw the salad dressing.""

Clementine rolled her eyes.

""You girls ready to head out?"" Lee asked

""Yep, got everything I need."" Ellie said, returning her joke book to her back pocket.

""Just the essentials?""

""Hey, this thing can turn any frown upside down. It is very essential.""

""It's turning my brain inside out."" Clementine mocked.

""You were laughing too.""

""At how bad they are.""

""Still laughing."" Ellie retorted.

""Let's get moving."" Joel said, curtly. ""We got a long way to go."" The four of them headed out the door of the lakeside cabin. 

For the next two weeks they headed west, sticking to the main roads. They made it to Blackwater, Missouri to discover a train blocking the main road through the small town. Joel led the way, stepping into the train cart. Before he could exit, a bullet ricocheted next to his head. ""Sniper!"" He shouted, directing the others back out of the train.

""Did you see where he was?"" Lee asked.

""The hotel. Second floor.""

""What's the plan?""

""You fire a round at him every now and then from around the train door, that should keep his attention. I'll go take him out and cover you until y'all get to the hotel. I'll whistle when I got the gun.""

""Sounds good, Joel."" Lee said. ""We got this.""

Joel ran to the other end of the train as Lee entered. He stuck his pistol around the train cart door and fired in the general direction of the hotel. In return, the sniper would fire several shots into and around the doorway. The two repeated this until finally, Lee heard a whistle. He peaked out the door and saw Joel waving, signaling the all clear.

""Okay, let's go girls."" 

The three of them passed through the train and heading down the street towards the hotel. 

""We got company!"" Joel yelled down to them. They turned to the right to see more hunters coming off the side street towards them. Lee and the girls took cover behind a car as Joel started picking off the hunters. From time to time, Lee would manage to hit one, but Joel's new rifle did the heavy lifting.

""We did it."" Ellie announced, once the last hunter fell. ""Thanks, Joel!"" She shouted up to him, giving a thumbs up.

However, the noise from fighting the hunters brought the attention of the infected. Three runners came out of the laundromat across the street from the hotel. One ran for Ellie, and she took it out. The other two each tackled Lee and Clementine. A moment later, Joel killed the one on Lee. At the same time, Ellie killed the one on Clementine, but not before it sank it's teeth into her thigh.

""AAAAAAHHHHH!"" Clementine let out a visceral scream.

""Shit!"" Ellie shouted. ""She's bit!"" She looked to her pistol.

""No, she's fine!"" Lee insisted, signaling for Ellie to lower her pistol. He scooped up Clementine in his arms and headed for the hotel.

""Lee, put her down!"" Ellie shouted, chasing him. ""She could turn at any time!""

""She won't!""

They entered the hotel lobby and were rejoined by Joel. Ellie blocked the doors behind them.

""Ah, god damn it."" Joel pulled out his gun. ""She's gonna turn.""

""No, she's not."" Lee argued, as he removed bandages and rubbing alcohol from his pack.

""I've. . ."" Clementine began. "" I've been bit before."" She slid her left pant leg up and pulled her sock down to show a healed bite with a slight amount of fungus around it on the back of her ankle.""

""Holy shit. . ."" Joel said.

""Look, I know how this sounds."" Lee tried to explain. ""That bite is from over two years ago. You got to believe me."" Joel and Ellie shared a knowing look. ""What?"" Lee began to panic. ""Look you just go on your way and leave her to me. You don't have to kill-""

""We believe you."" Ellie said. She went to pull up her sleeve, but Joel stopped her. ""No, Joel, it's fine."" Joel hesitated, but finally took his hand away. Ellie rolled up her sleeve to show Lee her bite.

""What the fuck. . ?"" Lee asked, stunned.

""Mine's a couple months old, but yeah. Same thing. Immune or whatever.""

""Is. . . is that why you're heading West?""

""We're looking for the Fireflies out West,"" Joel answered. ""Going to Wyoming to ask my brother where they're at. Apparently they can make a cure or vaccine from her blood.""

""Hey, yeah us too.""  Lee stammered. ""You don't have to go to Wyoming though, they're at the University."" He doused Clementine's wound with alcohol as she winced and bit her lip. ""That's the real reason I'm heading there."" He wrapped the bandage around her leg, and taped it together. ""That good?"" She nodded and he looked back to Joel. ""I saw her get bit. When she didn't turn, I knew I had to get her there. My old colleague, Dr. Norton, was head of the team researching a cure from the beginning. I haven't spoken to him in years, but I knew he'd need to see her.""

""You haven't talked to him in years?""

""No, but this isn't the kind of news you share in a letter or over the airwaves."" Lee looked towards Ellie. ""You were keeping the same secret.""

""That's fine."" Joel said bluntly, ""But what I mean is, if you haven't spoken in years, how do you know they are there?""

""That was their base for years and years."" Lee answered. ""No firefly I've spoken with has heard of it falling.""

""We gotta stick with them, Joel."" Ellie added. ""This is going to save so much fucking time.""

""So we got a deal?"" Lee asked.

""We got a deal."" Joel accepted. ""I guess we're going to Colorado.""

___
*""She's immune.""*

After nearly another month of roadside travelling and abandoned house camping, the four finally entered Denver, Colorado. On an overhead road sign, read 'University of Colorado 2 miles'. 

""You see that?"" Joel asked, pointing at the sign, ""Nearly there. About ten more minutes.""

""Finally."" Clementine let out, as she limped along with the others.

""Well, since we have time to kill. . ."" Ellie said, digging into her back pocket.

""Oh god.""

""Ellie please, don't."" Lee said with a smile. ""We've suffered enough.""

""To write with a broken pencil is pointless."" Ellie gleefully read.

""Done that one already."" Clementine sighed.

""Okay. . . How about. . . What do you call a fake noodle?""

""An impasta. You've done that one too.""

""Just give me a second, no way we've been through all of them. . . Here, this is gold. Did you hear about the guy who lost the left side of his body?""

""No."" Clementine laughed.

""He's alright now."" Ellie responded, as they all headed down the exit ramp towards the University.

""I don't get it.""

""Alright? Like all right now?""

"". . .""

""Alright, enough for today."" She returned the book to her pocket.

""I think we've had enough for every day."" Lee joked.

""I'll stop reading them when they stop being hilarious.""

""Then you never should have turned a page."" Clementine added.

The crew arrived at the entrance of The Colorado State University. They cautiously stepped through the gates and approached the courtyard.

""Looks pretty empty. . ."" Ellie stated.

""Let's keep our voices down."" Joel ordered in a whisper. ""There would definitely be guards by now. Lee, do you know where, the- Shit! Get down!"" The group did as ordered, and crouched behind a large water fountain that no longer functioned.

""What is it?"" Lee asked.

""A mess of clickers scattered in front of the main door.""

""Were they the fireflies?"" Clementine asked.

""I don't think so, they look a little too old for that.""

""What do we do?"" Ellie asked. ""Take 'em out?""

""Too many."" Joel answered. ""We'll make too much noise. We gotta sneak through them.""

""Fuck that.""

""It's the only way in, Ellie.""

""Me and Ellie can go."" Clementine offered. ""I'm immune. She's immune.""

""You're not immune from being torn apart."" Lee said sternly.

""We all go."" Joel said. ""Follow each others every step. I'll lead the way. Lee, you bring up the rear. If shit goes south, we can cover them from both sides.""

""You got it."" Lee confirmed. ""Ready when you are.""

""Okay, Ellie, you stick right behind me. Try to step exactly where I do. Watch for glass or rocks or anything that can make a sound.""

""I can do that.""

""Clementine, you do the same behind Ellie.""

""Got it."" Clementine confirmed.

""See that trash can to the left of the awning?"" Joel asked, pointing ahead. They nodded. ""We get there first. Ready?"" They nodded again. ""On me."" Joel quickly, but carefully crouch walked from behind the fountain. He went towards the overgrown hedges at the edge of the short set of stairs and followed them up. He slowed his pace down after the fourth and final step as they neared the first clicker. He steadied his breath and crept past the infected woman. It hissed and clicked as they went by, but made no other movements.

The next several clickers were about the same, then they made it to the trash can. Joel reached inside and pulled out some old beer bottles. With their backs to a wall and all the clickers to their right, Joel looked to his crew. He gestured that he would throw the bottle as far to the right of the doors a he could. Once the clickers chase the sound, they will head for the door. They all nodded, and Joel threw the bottle. And then another. The clickers all let out a deafening scream as they ran towards the source of the noise. Joel and company made their way to the doors. Joel pulled them open but they only opened about a foot. 

""There's a chair in the handles."" Joel whispered, and a clicker screamed in the distance. Joel felt the door handles rattle. He looked down to see Clementine crawling through the gap. Once inside, she grabbed the chair and pulled it out of the door handles, allowing the others to enter. Joel threw another bottle out the front to draw the charging clicker. They got inside, closed the doors, and re-placed the chair in the handles.

""Nicely, done, Clem."" Lee said, catching his breath. ""Nicely fucking done.""

""Sure, but this building is even emptier than the infected courtyard,"" Joel began, ""Where the fuck is everyone, Lee?""

""I don't know, they should be here. Let's check the directory.""

""The what?"" Ellie asked.

""This."" Lee answered, approaching the framed map of the campus in the middle of the lobby. ""Says the Laboratory is on the second floor of the east wing, south side of the building."" Lee pointed to the lab on the map. ""And we are-""

""Here!"" Ellie interrupted, pointing to the big red arrow that said 'you are here' on it. ""You. I. We are here.""

""Good one. You know how we get to the lab?""

Ellie studied the map. ""We go outside this building, and go to this other building?""

""Almost. That 'other building' is the second story of this one, so we just have to get to the stairs here,"" He pointed to the stairs with an up arrow,  ""and we'll enter the second floor here."" He pointed towards the second set of stairs with a down arrow.

""What are we waiting for then?"" Ellie asked, heading towards the stairs. ""Let's get a move on!""

""Sounds good."" Joel said. ""Except the stairs are this way."" He headed the correct direction towards the stairs.

""Whatever, that map's fucking stupid.""

They carefully went to and up the stairs and entered the second floor. As they did, a pack of monkeys noticed them, hopped across the desks scattered about the room, and ran out the window in a panic. 

""Check everything,"" Joel commanded, ""They had to leave something saying where they went to.""

""We're just gonna ignore the monkeys?"" Ellie asked.

""Yeah, they're great, but this isn't a safe place to be. Gotta keep moving.""

""Clem and I will take the office."" Lee said, guiding Clementine in front of him. The two entered the office. ""How's the leg?""

""Still hurts."" Clem answered. ""But less.""

""How you liking them?""

""Ellie is great!""

""And Joel?"" Lee asked, as he continued to dig through each desk.

""I don't know."" Clementine said, digging through a desk of her own. ""He's kinda scary.""

""Yeah he is, but he's a hell of a fighter. We need someone like that.""

""You're as tough as he is.""

""Nice of you to say, but didn't you almost have to kill him because he was beating me so bad?""

""You were just getting him where you wanted him.""

""Hmpf."" Lee laughed. ""I wanted him on the floor and me throwing the fists, not the other way around. I think we-""

""Guys!"" Ellie called out. ""We got something.""

""We're coming!"" Lee responded and he and Clementine regrouped with the others. 

""If you're looking for the others."" The voice on the tape Joel was playing said. ""They've all returned to saint Mary's Hospital in Salt Lake City. You'll find them there.""

""That voice. . ."" Lee said, eyeing the skeleton in the chair.

""Still trying to save the world.""

""Oh, Jimmy. . .""

""Good luck with that."" Dr. Norton said, signing off.

""Was he your friend?"" Clementine asked.

""Yes, he. . . shit that's who I was hoping to meet here.""

""Well, he told us where to go."" Joel said, ""He helped us out big time.""

""Yeah. . ."" Lee accepted. ""It's been nearly a decade, was just hoping to see him again. Too much to ask for these days.""

""Sorry for your loss, Lee, but we got what we came for. We should really keep moving.""

""You're right. I'm good. Let's get going.""

""This way."" Joel said, climbing out the window the monkeys used. They followed the awning to a moving truck, and climbed down to ground level to avoid the previous clickers. They left campus through the western gate, took the onramp to I-70, and continued to their new destination.

*""Just like Ellie.""*
___

Winter laid a fresh blanket of snow across the landscape over night as the four camped in an abandoned house just outside of No Name, Colorado. Once they were in their winter coats, they continued their journey. 

""Two cannibals are eating a clown."" Ellie begins, as the others groan. ""One says to the other 'Does this taste funny to you?'"" Clementine laughed. ""I heard that!""

""That one was funny,"" Clementine admitted. ""Just that one.""

""Let's go two for two."" The group neared the edge of No Name. ""What do you call a girl with one leg that's shorter than the other?""

""Uh, Clementine?""

""Your leg's not shorter than the other, it's just fucked up beyond repair.""

""You're right."" Clementine said, emphasizing her limp. ""And that's so much better.""

""Eileen."" Ellie said.

""What?""

""You call her Eileen. Like I lean.""

"". . .""

""You're a tough crowd, Clem. Tough crowd."" Ellie put the book away as they reached the bridge that went over the Colorado River at the edge of town.

""The roads are blocked."" Joel said, surveying the city. ""Lots of infected and broke down cars. Gonna take a while to get through there."" He looked further down river to spot a railroad bridge. ""We take that, it'll save time and probably our lives.""

""Works for me."" Lee said, and the four went towards the other bridge. ""At least Ellie will be too busy watching her step to read that awful book.""

""Awesome book."" Ellie said at the same time as Clementine, who was mocking her. ""See you're getting it!""

""Alright, everyone focus."" Joel said as they reached the bridge. ""We have to be very careful here."" They all nodded. ""We'll talk about how awful that book is later.""

""You too, Joel?""

""Everyone, Ellie. Everyone but you."" He gave her a smile. ""Let's do this.""

The group carefully walked across the railroad ties spanning the bridge, making sure to keep close to the rail where the wood is strongest. It went smoothly for a few hundred yards until they rounded the curve and found an abandoned train on the tracks. They discovered that a section of the bridge had rotted away under the rear cart, which had separated from the rest of the train, and the only thing holding it up were the tracks themselves.

""Fuck that."" Ellie laughed.

""It should hold."" Joel said.

""Should? That's like a hundred foot drop, Joel. You got anything more than should?""

""It will hold. Just watch."" Joel climbed to the top of the cart, stepping with each squeal of the iron. He made it to the top and slowly rose to his feet. He quickly ran across the twenty foot cart, got to the end, and climbed down. When he disembarked, there was another loud grown from the metal and wood of the bridge. He called back to the others. ""Okay. It held the heaviest of us. You girls come first, then Lee.""

""Rock, paper, scissor for who's first?"" Ellie asked Clementine, holding a fist on her palm.

""I guess. . ."" Clementine hesitated.

""Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!"" They said in unison.

""Paper beats rock!"" Clementine declared.

""Best two out of three?""

""Just go, you chicken.""

""Hey, I'm not scared of the train. It's the train falling and crushing me to death thing.""

""That's the part we're all scared of.""

""Oh."" Ellie replied. ""If it isn't just me then, okay."" She climbed onto the train, the metal sang a little louder than with Joel. She could feel the rumble as she slowly inched forward. ""Joel, it's shaking!""

""Okay."" Joel began. ""Just move a little quicker and get off of it so it can settle back down!""

Ellie quickened her pace and reached the center as it start to shake and tilt. ""Oh fuck!""

""Jump to me!"" Joel shouted as he stood to the left of the train at the end of the cart. Ellie ran as hard as she could and leaped towards Joel. He caught her and the tracks gave way, sending the train cart to the river below. Joel and Ellie quickly moved toward the next trestle in case more of the bridge wanted to fail. The crash of the cart was deafening.

""God damn!"" Lee called across the ravine. ""What do we do now?"" 

""I-shit. . ."" Joel responded, ""I guess double back and head through town! We'll wait for you at the end of the bridge!""

""Okay, that might take a while! If there's any trouble, go ahead to St. Mary's and we'll just meet you there!"" Lee looked towards the city to see a large wave of infected leaving the city, heading towards the fallen train. ""You seeing that?!""

""I see it!""

""At least the city will be clear!""

""Stay sharp!"" Joel responded.

""We will!"" Lee assured him.

""Be careful, Clem!"" Ellie shouted. ""Endure and survive!""

""See you on the other side!"" Clementine called back.

Joel and Ellie continued on as Lee and Clementine headed back.

""Will they be okay?""

""Oh, yeah."" Lee answered. ""Joel knows what he's doing. And Ellie is tough.""

""Will we be okay?""

""Of course! I know what I'm doing. And you're tough.""

""Just like Ellie."" Clementine assured herself.

""That's right.""

Ellie and Joel were out of site long before Lee and Clementine made it back to the other side. They followed the edge of the river back to the main bridge that went into No Name. They entered the city, squeezing between and crawling over the many cars, trucks, and vans that clogged the streets. After the first block, they cut through a small café with an open backdoor that lead to the ally. They walked past the empty counter with the busted register, trying not to step on the the shards of glass that were once coffee mugs.

As they neared the exit, a clicker slowly made it's way out of the supply closet just to the right of the exit. Lee took Clementine's hand, and directed her to follow him. The clicker let out a shriek as they moved past him. Once Clementine was on the other side, Lee picked up a half intact coffee mug and threw it towards the counter. It shattered against a stack of mugs and made a terrible clash. The clicker screamed and ran towards it. Lee and Clementine stepped out into the ally and closed the door, triggering its automatic lock.

The noise however, attracted something worse. A bloater. It's low growl made Lee's stomach turn. It slowly stomped it's way toward the exit of the café, as Lee and Clementine moved along, staying silent. With a few yards between them and the monster, Lee did a quick survey of the alley. Further down the alley, a delivery truck was parked under a fire escape ladder on the neighboring apartments. Lee pointed for Clementine to go for it. As she did, Lee kept his eye on the bloater while backing towards the truck. He stepped on a manhole lid, that gave a slight rattle. The bloater noticed.

""Run!"" Lee shouted to Clementine, and she ran straight to the truck, and began scrambling up it. Lee pulled the manhole lid further off the sewer opening as the monstrosity approached. It was halfway off when he stood up in time to receive a blow to the ribs that sent him flying into the truck, banging his head on the headlight. 

""Lee!"" Clementine yelled from the first fire escape landing. She started pumping bullets into the bloater. ""Are you okay?""

""Oh, fuck. . ."" He looked up at the bloater, and smiled as it took a step forward and fell into the hole. ""Thank Christ. . ."" He looked back up to Clementine. ""Doing better now."" He pulled himself up. ""You okay, Sweet pea?""

""Yeah. No bites.""

""Me neither, but I think it broke my ribs."" Lee wrapped his right arm around his left ribs to help relieve the pressure for the climb. After a good ten minutes of struggling and grunting, he made it to the rooftops with Clementine. He scanned the makeshift bridges left behind by other survivors that ran to the other side of the city. ""Deja vu.""

""No kidding."" Clementine said, taking in the scene. ""What was your rule about cities?""

""Yeah, yeah. . . Let's just get out of here.""

___
*""There they are.""*
___
After leaving No Name behind Lee and Clementine had the end of the railroad bridge in their sights. With Clementine's bad leg and Lee's wrapped ribs, the pair were quite hobbled. They eventually got close enough to the bridge to see it surrounded with infected. Lee got out his binoculars to scan the area. The infected seemed calm and to be standing around for no particular reason, as if their target was long gone. He scanned the track a ways before seeing a white van with mud smeared on it. He focused in to read, 'TOO MANY, GO TO ST. MARY' written in mud.

""Looks like they out ran the herd."" Lee said, handing Clementine the binoculars, and directing where to look. ""We need to keep going before they see us.""

""At least we know they're okay."" Clementine said, handing the binoculars back to Lee. ""If they had time to leave a note.""

""We'll take the road a little further until they can't see us.""

""Or hear us.""

""Right. Or hear us."" Lee rubbed his ribs while the duo walked. ""Then we'll get back on the train tracks and see if we can't pick up their trail.""

""You now how to do that?""

""Not really, but if they left one note, they probably left others. Besides, those tracks should go straight to Salt Lake.""

""If the tracks aren't fucked."" Clementine laughed.

""Swear."" Lee chuckled.

""Ugh. Was it that annoying when I said it?""

""No, it was cute when you did it.""

""Well it isn't when you do it.""

""I thought I was being adorable.""

The two shared a laugh as they continued further down the road, now out of seeing and hearing distance from the infected. They turned towards the trains tracks.

""Lee?"" Clementine began. ""How long will it take?""

""Oh, maybe another day or so."" Lee answered. ""Sorry I'm slowing us down.""

""No not that. I mean, how long will it take to make a cure?""

""Oh, that. Well, that can take years. Or months. Or, it might not even happen. . .""

""That's what I'm afraid of. What if they never do? Will they want to keep taking my blood forever?""

""No, we won't be doing that. You give the word and we are out of there.""

""Just like that?"" Clementine asked with a smile.

""Just like that."" Lee repeated, before he stopped to face his companion. ""Look, you don't even have to do this. I mean, if you don't want to. They got Ellie and probably a lot of other people that are immune. It can't just be you two.""

""Well, we've come this far. I at least want to see Ellie again.""

""If that's what you want. . ."" Lee continued down the tracks. ""Let's get to it.""

The duo continued down the tracks for most of the way, only veering off when they saw a mud note saying 'SOUTH', 'WEST', or 'NORTH', until the final sign just outside of Salt Lake City said, 'HWY 70'. They took the onramp and continued West until they rounded a city bus on it's side and looked up to see St. Mary's Hospital was standing tall in the distance.

""About time."" Clementine said, exhausted.

""You're telling me."" Lee laughed, then grabbed his ribs. Towards the top of the hospital, he could see some sort of light flickering. He took out his binoculars to find the source. It was Joel standing by a broken window, wiggling a knife back and forth to catch the sunlight. He saw Lee looking, put the knife away and waved. ""I'll be god damned."" Lee waved back.

""What is it?"" Clementine asked.

""There they are. They fucking made it!""

""Is Ellie there?""

""Oh, no, it's just Joel, but he actually looks worried about us."" He could see Joel waving them towards him. ""Alright, Joel, we're coming."" Lee gave him a  thumbs up and put the binoculars away. ""Let's keep going, almost there.""

""I'll race you there!"" Clementine said and ran. 

""Clem!""

Clementine stopped, looking back. ""I'm just teasing.""

""Good, because I'm damn sure not running.""

The pair walked to the exit ramp and headed down off the highway. The streets had several infected littered throughout the area with fresh bullet wounds. This put them at ease, knowing they wouldn't have to fight infected themselves any time soon. After ten blocks of walking through the silent city full of death, they finally made it to the Hospital entrance. A Firefly opened the gate for them and they were greeted by Joel and a wall of five other Fireflies.

""You made it!"" Lee said cheerfully, the Firefly behind him closed the gate as they others raised their rifles. Lee and Clementine raised their pistols. ""Joel, what the fuck?""

""Weapons down!"" One of the soldiers demanded. ""Drop your guns and your bags!""

""It's. . . just protocol."" Joel insisted.

""Lee, what do we do?"" Clementine asked. 

""We. . . shit. . . Do what they say.""

Lee dropped his gun, as did Clementine.

""Now the bags!"" The same soldier demanded. They complied. ""Search them!""

The soldier that closed the gate gave Lee a quick pat down, taking his knife from his boot and tossing it towards the others. He patted down Clementine, she winced as he squeezed her ankle, but he found no other weapons. ""All clear.""

""This way."" Joel said, gesturing towards the Fireflies.

""Where's Ellie?"" Clementine asked as she walked past Joel.

""She's. . .""

""Right here."" A woman said, pushing a gurney, that was carrying a sedated Ellie, from behind the other Fireflies.

""Joel?"" Lee began before, turning around. ""What's-"" A shot rang out as a bullet went through Lee's chest. ""Aarrgghh!!"" He dropped to his knees, gripping the wound. Joel lowered his gun, the barrel still smoking, and grabbed Clementine by the arm, knocking her hat off in the process.

""Lee!"" Clementine screamed, while she punched at Joel. ""You motherfucker!"" She punch and kicked as hard as she could, forcing Joel to grab her with both arms. ""Let me go!"" She looked back to her protector. ""Lee! Please get up! Lee!""

Joel carried her to the woman, lifted her pant leg up to show the woman the bite on her ankle. The woman nodded, gave the gurney to Joel, and took hold of Clementine.

""What did you do to her?"" Clementine demanded, struggling to break free. ""Let go of me! What the fuck are you doing?"" The woman didn't answer.

""Joel, you piece of shit!"" Lee coughed, trying to get up. ""Tell them to let her-"" Lee was cut short by one of the Fireflies shooting him through the face, when he collapsed, they put another in the top of his head.

""Noooooo!"" Clementine cried as Lee laid motionless on the ground, blood covering her hat, and pooling all around his body. ""No,  no, no, no. . ."" The lead Firefly helped the woman hold Clementine still. ""Lee! Please, let me see him. Please! Joel, please tell them. Joel, please!"" The woman injected her with a sedative, as Joel pushed the gurney away. ""Joel! Look at me! Ellie, wake up!"" The sedative took effect. ""Joel. . . . Le-"" She managed before passing out.

""Take her inside."" The woman commanded. ""Prep her for surgery."" 

Joel kept pushing the gurney, no expression on his face, each step taking him towards Wyoming, with Ellie safe and sound.

""Find someone else, Marlene."" Joel demanded.

""There is no one else."" Marlene responded, coldly.

""There is. Another little girl.""

""Bullshit.""

""She's infected. I saw her get bit. She's immune. Just like Ellie.""

""Oh yeah? Where is she?""

He pointed out the window, towards the highway. ""They'll be walking down that road any minute now.""

""I don't have time for this."" Marlene began to walk away.

""Marlene, god damn it, I swear, I'm not lying,"" He took out his binoculars and looked to the road. ""I swear, any minute and. . ."" He saw shadows coming from behind a bus followed shortly by Lee and Clementine. ""There they are."" Marlene took a look through the tinted window and saw the duo.

""Okay, Joel."" Marlene began. ""Show me her bite, and I'll take her.""

""And I get Ellie?""

""You get Ellie."" She answered, extending her hand. ""We have a deal?""

""Deal."" Joel said, shaking her hand. He returned to the broken window, removed his knife, and turned it to catch the sunlight. ""We got a deal. . .""",1,1746763937.0,TWDGFanFic,0,1.0,False

Also give me some positive success stories, today is a tough day mentally. Any of your healed heroes, how’s life?! Give us hopeeeee","Just need to vent a little and also ask for some motivation. I’m doing my best to stick to a healing plan, but it feels like I’m barely functioning on like 1000 calories a day and I’m like 6 ft 3 so not a small guy. 

I’ve been following the gastritis healing book (you probably know the one), trying to stay alkaline, cutting all the usual triggers, no onions, garlic, red meat, dairy, caffeine, etc. My meals are down to sweet potatoes, squash, okra, and some very plain chicken or fish. It’s hard, man. It’s really hard.

What’s making it worse is that PPIs (I was on rabeprazole) didn’t help, in fact, they made things worse. Switched to sucralfate now, which helps. Still dealing with prepyloric inflammation, and my stomach literally feels like it swells up after eating even the “safe” stuff. Some days I feel hopeful, other days (like today) it just feels endless.

So here’s my ask:

If you’ve healed from this, please tell me what worked. How strict were you with diet? How long did it take? What does your life look like now? Are you eating normally again? Traveling? Drinking coffee?? Anything??

Would love to hear from the healed heroes, give us some hope. This stuff messes with your head as much as your gut.

Believe it or not there are still some standard US MRE menus I have never had!

What we have here is one of them! A 2021 pack date Southwest Beef with Black Beans! 

I think I had given away this menu to a couple folks in some of the earlier cases I bought....so I had never tried it. 

Pics 1-2 show packaging and contents. In my opinion this menu is pretty well put together in this pack date year. You've got your tortillas, and not just the plain ones, these are the chipotle which, to me, smell and taste like bbq sauce. You've got your cheese spread, and you've got your Southwest Beef! All the makings of some proper tacos/burritos!

Pic 3 shows the main. I honestly cannot believe just how good this main was. Absolutely no ""retort pouch"" taste at all. Strong savory and bold flavors with huge chunks of tender beef and delicate black beans. The corn was a fantastic addition adding slight sweet kisses in an otherwise overwhelming savory main dish.

Pic 4 shows the cobbler.  This stuff looks like a horror scene, but when warmed up in the FRH....it's fantastic. Sweet, tart, and filling. I know some folks hate this dessert, but I like it. A scoop of vanilla ice cream on this would be divine.

Pic 5 is the 2nd dessert, the Applesauce Pound Cake. These things are fantastic and, like many of the other desserts, is even better when warmed by the FRH. Next time I get one of these, I am going to warm again and add a sprinkle of cinnamon! Again, a scoop of vanilla ice cream with this would be heaven.

The teriyaki stick is not my favorite,  but makes a great on-the-go snack that can be taken anywhere and eaten quickly with no mess or fuss.

These 2021s still have coffee and even have both sugar and zero cal sweetener. A nice touch for sure. Those sweeteners could be used in the cobbler quite effectively as well I'm sure if you like your coffee black. I wonder what the creamer would do to the cobbler???

In summary, a great meal that I would recommend to anyone. I think this is the best Mexican inspired menu currently active.

Take care folks!",5,1746763513.0,MRE,0,1.0,False

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/r9RHMrhSyK): **April 20, 2025**

The Tl:Dr of my relationship is:
\- husband and I have been together almost 9 years, married for 2.5
\- we’re both around 30 y/o
\- had our baby ~14 months ago, the pregnancy was a surprise birth control failure but we both wanted kids and were happy
\- we had discussed ethical non-monogamy in the past, but put the discussion on hold during pregnancy
\- after I gave birth my husband brought it up again and started really pushing for polyamory
\- he also took on extra work as I had to stay home due to daycare costs eating up more than my monthly paycheck would cover
\- he started pushing me off on his family and wouldn’t ever be home to help me or give me a break. He told me to go to his mom for a break, and all he was good for was bringing home money
\- throughout all of postpartum he’s basically insinuated if not outright said that he doesn’t want me to rely on him or want him around
\- at 6 months postpartum he pushed for us to open our relationship.. I hated it, he was disappointed when we closed it after a month.
\- I also went back to school full time at this time and have maintained a 4.0 since
\- we’ve been in couples therapy for about 5/6 months now. We each have our own therapists too.
\- baby was also EBF and I still nurse her 2-3 times a day and plan to do so until at least 18 months or so

Alright, so that’s the background.

Now we’re in therapy, and I thought it was working. The last few weeks he’s worked less and made time to hang out with me and our baby more. He’s planned outings for us, taken us for bike rides, been home to cook dinner and do chores, and to watch the baby/toddler so I can have some me time or some friend time. It’s been so nice, and I mentioned to him that it made me happy, and thanked him for doing all this and making progress like we’ve talked about in therapy.

On our walk this morning (and in our last therapy session) he said it made him disappointed that I was so happy with spending all the time together. He said he noticed that since he didn’t spend so much time doing extra work (he’d normally work 60+h/week but cut it down to closer to 50h/week) and hanging out with us more at home that I’d been happier, and that it just proved to him that he was the problem. He said that everything he wants is a problem, and when he doesn’t do or get what he wants then I’m happy. He said he’s happy spending time with me and our baby, but he’s disappointed too.

Idk what to even think of this. I’m just hurt that I’ve dedicated so much time and energy to this relationship, to raising our baby (who is absolutely incredible), and that I’ve been told I shouldn’t be asking more of him, and that when we do spend time together he might be happy in the moment, but seems to look ack at it with regret and disappointment. Idk if he’s even happy to be with me. It doesn’t feel like it. It feels like he sees our relationship as holding him back, but when I try to tell him this he just says it feels like I don’t trust him. He says that lack of trust makes him not want to try. I tell him I’m trying to trust him, but he keeps doing this same pattern of spending time with us and then pulling away and then the cycle repeats. I don’t want him to pull back away, I don’t want him to tell me I shouldn’t need him. That’s when I can start trusting him again. Right now i’m always waiting for him to stop engaging with me and to just always be away.

He struggles a lot with negative self talk and negative self image, so I try not to say negative things when describing what I want out of our relationship, or how I’m hurt. But then he just puts words in my mouth, feels self pity, shuts down and stops talking to me for a day or more.

What do I do from here? How do I even address this? What do I say to our therapist?

Tl:Dr

My husband is disappointed that spending more time with me and our toddler makes me happier in our relationship, and he can’t just do whatever he wants and have me be fine with it.

**Relevant Comments**

**OOP on her husband helping her with her PPD**

> **OOP:** There was a time over the summer when my PPD was really bad. One day I asked him to come home from work early. Another day a week or so later I asked him to stay home entirely. He’s a construction worker, so not always with the same company, and that company didn’t ask him to come to the next job with them. He said that after he left and stayed home to help me they all treated him differently and sort of isolated him. Instead of being upset with those misogynistic assholes, he was upset with me, and sometimes still brings it up as an example of how I can’t handle myself and the baby on my own. I’ve told him his frustration is misplaced, that I shouldn’t be blamed for needing him, and if a job can’t be understanding that a new dad may need to help his wife and child that it’s better he doesn’t work with them anymore. He just gets more frustrated. Caring for out kid is OUR job, not MY job

**Commenter 1:** Sounds like he didn’t really want to be a monogamous partner or a parent, he may have just been ticking off boxes on the “life milestone” list (get married, have kids, so on). Either way, at least he’s gained some self awareness and realized he’s been a crappy husband and father. He’s shown you a pattern that is likely to repeat itself.

> **OOP:** I keep telling him this, that for the past year this pattern has repeated. He’ll be more involved for a couple weeks, then throw himself back into work and I’ll have no support from him. He asked me today how long it will take for me to trust him, and that he feels like he’s being timed. I said there is no time limit, the change has to keep going. I see that he’s putting in the work, but I’ve seen that before, and I want it to actually stick, or for him not to put up such a fight about it if it does start to slip into him working too much again.

**Commenter 2:** I’ve seen this kind of thing happen when people get together very young, you guys seemed to be 21. You likely didn’t get a lot of dating & relationships in before the two of you were together. He isn’t happy, he’s said it by word and deed repeatedly. He doesn’t want you to be happy in this because he wants out. He wants to be with other people, again he’s shown this through word and deed. Do you want to be stuck with someone who does not want you? Do you want to be with someone who resents you for wanting to only be with him?

> **OOP:** He dated a lot of people before me. I only dated him (I went on a few dates, but didn’t have any relationships). He said about 2/3 weeks ago that maybe we should separate. I went to my parents house with the baby. He started apologizing and changed his actions. Now he’s upset I’m happy with the change. It just feels like a big back and forth. I’m getting tired of it. I’m scared to not be with him though. I love so many of the people where we live, and I know I’d be the one giving that up, those friendships and supports I had to build while he was away working and doing whatever. It’s just so unfair. He didn’t have to stay with me if this wasn’t what he wanted. But he made every effort and attempt to say it was, to commit himself to me and us. But once we have a baby he wants out? He wanted me to keep the baby. He doted on me all through pregnancy

**Commenter 3:** 

> the pregnancy was a surprise birth control failure but we both wanted kids and were happy

Are you sure you weren't the only one happy about this? Whose birth control failed? I'm guessing it wasn't his because very little of what you have shared tells me that he wants to be a parent.

Therapy is not the answer. You guys want completely different things.

> **OOP:** I had a copper IUD. Baby implanted next to it. I sent him a picture of the test, then he met me at the OBGYN for ultrasound confirmation and IUD removal. He cried when he saw the pictures and said he was so happy and wanted to be a dad. I was hesitant and said we could consider an abortion due to life circumstances and the surprise of it all. He said it was up to me. We decided to keep the baby

**Commenter 4:** How much longer until you finish school? I would honestly focus on being done so you can secure higher earning potential for yourself, quietly talk to a divorce lawyer so you can strategize re: the best time to file and seek spousal support and child support, and then leave and let him do whatever the f he wants. He doesn’t like being a husband or a father and he seems manipulative and selfish.

> **OOP:** Two years and I’m done.

&nbsp;

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/0DaDAhy9T6): **May 1, 2025 (11 days later)**

I had gotten in contact with a divorce lawyer’s office and had a brief consultation with a secretary. It wasn’t too long and I haven’t done much more gathering of info because I’ve had 10 different final papers/projects/presentations happening and just don’t have the time or energy to work on it right now.

Since his last comments things had gone back to getting better. We still spent time together with our toddler, and things were starting to feel fun and like we were getting closer again.

Then we went for a walk today.

On our walk he asked me how I thought things had been between us. I said I thought they’d been good, that I liked spending time together. Then I asked if he was still feeling the same way as the last time we’d talked about this. He basically said yes, that he’s disappointed that he’s the problem, and if it wasn’t for him we wouldn’t be in couples therapy. He also said that he doesn’t ask me to change anything for him (which is bs, he asked me to be poly with/for him).

I felt frustrated at this, because I’m not asking him to change, I’m asking him to do what he had done our whole relationship before he changed. He used to make me homemade picnic dates, surprise me with my favorite snacks and coffee and drinks, or my favorite chocolates from a European style chocolatier. We’d go on a date every weekend, and hang out every evening. We’d text constantly, and always found new things to talk about even after almost 8 years.

Then once the baby was born he began pushing me away, telling me I shouldn’t rely on him, while also pushing for a polyamorous relationship. He told me he would burn the fumes in his tank to make sure others were taken care of, but then tell me he couldn’t give me those same fumes when I needed him, or even anything from his tank when it was full.

It was so the opposite of how he used to treat me.

And I told him this on our walk. His response was to say he accepts that he was at fault, but I wouldn’t be convinced of his position no matter what he said.

I told him that he’s not accepting he was/is at fault if he keeps trying to convince me otherwise.

In our next couples therapy session I’m going to bring up that I think we’ve been both-sides-ing the issues in our relationship. I’m guilty of participating in this, I’ll defend him and try to protect his ego and work together. But honestly? I haven’t done anything wrong in this regard. I’ve acted and reacted in an impossible situation that my husband has put me in.

I just don’t know why the birth of our child changed him so much, made polyamory into such a fixation of his when that time and energy for his “self discovery” should have been put into directly caring for myself and our baby. He keeps trying to make excuses that he didn’t get to do much the first year of her life, but he:

\- went on multiple hours long hikes and dinners with his friend
\- went on a solo camping trip
\- slept over at another friend’s house for their birthday instead of coming to the first family outing I had planned since giving birth
\- went hiking and rafting a couple times with the significant others of some of my friends
\- went on dates with me
\- went on dates with other people
\- had dinner with friends
\- went on solo bike rides where he’d be gone for multiple hours or even all day

And his comeback when I point this out to him? It’s not as much as he usually did before the baby, he only got to ride his motorcycle once or twice last year. I could have done all those things too! (Never mind that I was exclusively breastfeeding our baby, and going out anywhere meant having a portable pump and refrigeration options on hand, never mind a space where I could actually comfortably sit and pump for 20-30 minutes in the middle of activities).

Idk. Just what the fuck happened? How did I go from a devoted and loving feminist minded husband to whatever he is now?

Whatever. I’m still going to try and fix things because maybe at some point he’ll see the light, but at the same time I’m going to begin to craft my exit plan.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Wait so his tank is on fumes but he wants… additional partners? He can’t take care of the relationship he has but he wants more of them?

This man was never a progressive feminist, and is acting like an entitled baby. He has a child and a wife, and he’s acting like he didn’t ask for either and he’s a victim. I dont think there is a “both sides” here and I would seriously reconsider any couples therapist who lets him get away with thinking both of you are contributing to him being entitled, disengaged, and selfish.

> **OOP:** Yeah, I’ve been frustrated by that in therapy, though I think our therapist is trying to follow our lead a little bit because he knows he can’t fix it for us and is trying to help us figure out how to fix it ourselves. I’ve also been contributing to it and presenting things that way because I’m not trying to avoid responsibility for things, but yeah, it’s not my fault things are the way they are.

**Commenter 2:** What did he expect when y'all became parents? He's a dad now, and shit gets real when you have to put all your energy, money, blood, sweat and tears into raising them right. It's not going to be a bed of roses the whole way, and I'm sorry that he's placing the fault on you. You don't deserve to be treated like the problem when it's him that's making insane demands on you. You're doing the right thing, girl.

> **OOP:** Thank you. It’s not like he didn’t expect it (or at least he was aware). We talked throughout the pregnancy about how everything will change, how it already had changed for me, how my life and my plans were pushed back a year because of pregnancy and postpartum.
> 
> He got to keep much more of his life and freedom than I did. Yes he took on extra side work to bring in some of the money we were losing with me staying home (though we would have lost even more if I’d kept working), but all the time he was working I was taking care of our baby. And all the time he wasn’t working I was taking care of our baby.

**Commenter 3:** He was never a true feminist. Oh sure, he was a ""feminist"" when he was getting sex more regularly and he was the main character in your life. But after baby? Patriarchy says he's not supposed to be the caregiver. Patriarchy says it's normal for you to be a burned out mess, not his problem. Patriarchy says it's normal for him to want sex with other people no matter how his wife feels about it. So he believed it. It benefits him. That's the whole story. Maybe he gets his head out of his ass and decides to actually build a loving and successful life with you, someone who really wants that. But that's going to be an uphill climb because he's already figure out that just following the scripts he's heard all his life ensures his life really didn't have to change half as much as yours did. I would really hone in on that with the therapist - and if the therapist tries to ""both sides"" - fire that therapist. You don't need a therapist to act like you're the problem here when you 100% are not. I feel for you and I think it's wise you're keeping an exit plan.

> **OOP:** I just don’t really know how to make that exit plan. I’m not working as I take care of the toddler full time, and am in school on a full time schedule too (squished into two days a week while my parents take the little one), so I’m not making my own money atm. I don’t graduate until 2027 (with a masters, woo!) so I either have to stay with him until I get a job after graduation so I can afford my own place, or I have to move in with my parents before that, who don’t really have the space for us but can make it work.

**Commenter 4:** Seriously no, just break up. This is a complete waste of time and energy. I was rooting for you in the last post and I felt that reading this is waste of my time and energy lol. Just break up. 

> **OOP:** Thank you. I feel like my wheels are just spinning on this too. It feels like every time things get better lately he tells me he’s not fulfilled. Idk why he won’t just break up with me then. What does he want to fix if being together makes him feel so bad?

Leo Miller was just another face in the bustling hallways of Northwood High. Fifteen years old, a decent student, not exactly popular but with a solid group of friends he'd known since elementary school. There was Maya, sharp and observant, always the first to call him out on his nonsense; Sam, the quiet, loyal one who usually just went along with things; and Chloe, bubbly and empathetic, the glue that held their small group together. They spent their lunches crammed together at a corner table, complained about homework, and navigated the awkward social landscape of high school side-by-side.

Leo's childhood felt like a faded photograph in his memory. He remembered moving, a big old house that gave him the creeps, and being sick for a while. His parents were always a little too quick to change the subject when the old house came up, and Leo, sensing it was a sore spot, learned not to ask. He had a normal life now – video games, band practice (he played bass, badly), crushing on girls from afar. The past was just... the past.

But lately, his friends had started exchanging worried glances behind his back. It began subtly. A sharp, cutting remark from Leo that felt out of character, aimed at a classmate who tripped in the hall. Not just a typical teenage jab, but something colder, laced with a strange, almost gleeful malice that made Maya flinch.

""Dude, that was harsh,"" Sam mumbled later, kicking at a pebble on the sidewalk.

Leo just shrugged, a smile playing on his lips that didn't quite reach his eyes. ""He's clumsy. What's it matter?""

It did matter. It wasn't the Leo they knew. Their Leo would have probably helped the kid up, or at least kept his mouth shut.

Then there were the moments of unsettling detachment. One afternoon, they were watching a news report about a local tragedy. Chloe gasped, covering her mouth, her eyes welling up. Sam looked somber. Leo, however, just stared at the screen with a blank expression, like he was watching a nature documentary about ants.

""That's awful,"" Maya said, her voice quiet. ""Those poor people.""

Leo finally blinked, turning away from the TV. ""Yeah, I guess. Doesn't really affect us, though, right?""

Chloe looked at him, her brow furrowed. ""Leo! How can you say that?""

He just shrugged again, that same unsettlingly indifferent shrug. ""Just saying. It's sad, sure, but it's not our problem.""

His lack of empathy was starting to creep them out.

The nightmares started affecting his behavior during the day. He'd come to school looking drawn and tired, his eyes shadowed. Sometimes, he'd space out mid-conversation, a distant, troubled look on his face. When they asked what was wrong, he'd just shake his head and say, ""Nothing. Didn't sleep well.""

One particularly unnerving incident happened during a biology class. They were dissecting frogs, a task Chloe was finding particularly difficult. She was struggling to make an incision, her hands trembling slightly. Leo, sitting next to her, leaned over.

""Here,"" he said, his voice flat. He took her scalpel, and with unnerving precision and speed, made a perfect, deep cut. But it wasn't just the efficiency; it was the look on his face as he did it – a flicker of something cold and almost predatory, a brief, intense focus that felt utterly wrong. He held the scalpel like he was born to wield it, and for a second, Maya, watching from across the table, felt a chill crawl up her spine.

Chloe jumped back, startled. ""Leo! You scared me!""

He handed the scalpel back, his expression instantly returning to normal. ""Sorry. Just trying to help.""

But the look hadn't been about helping. Maya was sure of it.

The worry among the friends escalated into hushed conversations when Leo wasn't around.

""He's different, right?"" Chloe whispered, twisting her hands. ""It's not just me?""

""No, it's not just you,"" Maya confirmed, her voice low. ""He's... colder. And those weird things he says...""

""And the way he looked at that frog,"" Sam added, a shiver running down his spine. ""Like... like he enjoyed it too much.""

They didn't know what was happening to their friend. They tried talking to him, gently asking if something was wrong, if he was okay. He'd brush them off, or worse, get defensive, his eyes flashing with an anger that felt foreign and sharp.

The breaking point came one Friday night. They were at Sam's house, playing video games. Leo was unusually quiet, his jaw clenched. The game wasn't going well, and after a particularly frustrating level, Leo suddenly threw his controller across the room with violent force. It hit the wall, shattering into pieces.

Sam's parents weren't home, but the sudden, explosive anger startled everyone.

""Whoa, man! Chill out!"" Sam exclaimed, staring at the broken controller.

Leo stood up, his chest heaving. His eyes were wide, and for a terrifying moment, Maya saw a flicker of blackness in his eyes.

""I'm fine,"" Leo ground out, his voice tight. ""It's just a stupid game.""

But it wasn't just a game. It was an outburst of raw, disproportionate rage that scared them.

As Leo stormed out of the room, muttering to himself, the three friends looked at each other, their faces pale.

""That wasn't Leo,"" Chloe whispered, tears welling in her eyes.

Maya nodded slowly, a knot of dread tightening in her stomach. They had tried to ignore it, to explain it away as teenage angst or stress. But this... this was something else. Something dark and wrong was happening to their friend. The cracks they had seen were widening, threatening to reveal whatever terrifying thing lay beneath. And they were starting to realize that their friend might be in serious trouble



Chapter 2: The Shadow in the Stillness



The shattered controller lay on Sam’s floor like a broken promise. After Leo had stormed out, the three friends sat in stunned silence, the lingering tension thick in the air. The outburst, the look in Leo's eyes – it had cracked something open between them, a shared understanding that their friend was on a path none of them recognized.

""What... what was that?"" Chloe finally whispered, her voice trembling.

Maya hugged her knees, staring at the broken plastic. ""I don't know. But it wasn't him. Not really.""

Sam picked up a piece of the controller, turning it over in his fingers. ""He's been acting weird for weeks. Colder. Angry.""

""And that look,"" Maya added, a shiver going down her spine. ""When he threw it... it was like something else was looking out of his eyes.""

They talked late into the night, rehashing every unsettling incident, every cold remark, every moment of blank detachment. They didn't have answers, only a growing dread that the Leo they knew was slowly slipping away.

The strange occurrences didn't stop with the controller. They escalated, becoming more frequent and more unnerving. It started small. Objects would move when no one was looking. A book would slide off a shelf in Leo's classroom when he wasn't even near it. A classroom door would slam shut with unnatural force as he walked past. Leo himself seemed oblivious, or if he noticed, he didn't react.

His nightmares seemed to intensify. He'd sometimes fall asleep in class, his face contorted in a silent struggle, muttering words they couldn't understand. When woken, he'd be disoriented, his eyes wide and fearful, before quickly shutting down and pretending nothing happened.

But the true terror began to manifest not around Leo during the day, but in the quiet of the night, affecting those closest to him.

Chloe was the first. She woke up one night to the sound of her bedroom door creaking open. Her heart pounded. She lay still, listening. The door swung wider, revealing the dark hallway. And then, a shape detached itself from the shadows just outside her room. It was indistinct, a wavering patch of deeper darkness against the gloom, but it had a form – the unmistakable silhouette of a person. As it glided silently into her room, she saw it clearly against the faint moonlight filtering through her window. It was shaped like Leo. The same height, the same build. It moved with a strange, unnatural smoothness, drifting rather than walking.

It stopped by her dresser, and a moment later, her jewelry box flew across the room, hitting the wall with a clatter. Chloe stifled a scream, pulling the covers over her head, trembling uncontrollably. She heard the shadow move again, felt a cold presence near her bed, before it seemed to melt back into the darkness and out the door. When she finally dared to look, her room was a mess, objects scattered, but nothing was broken except the jewelry box. Her parents found her sobbing the next morning, dismissing it as a bad dream, but Chloe knew what she had seen.

Then it was Sam's turn. He was woken by the sound of his closet door rattling violently. He sat up in bed, adrenaline flooding his system. The rattling stopped, and then his desk lamp, sitting across the room, suddenly flared to life, casting eerie shadows. He saw it then, standing by his desk – a figure of pure shadow, shaped exactly like Leo. It turned its head towards him, and though it had no features, Sam felt an intense, cold gaze fix on him. The shadow raised a hand, and books were swept off his shelves, hitting the floor with loud thuds. Sam yelled, scrambling out of bed, and the shadow figure seemed to recoil, fading back into the darkness.

Maya experienced the most terrifying incident. She was a light sleeper, and she woke to a feeling of being watched. Her room was dark, but the air felt heavy, charged with a malevolent energy. She slowly opened her eyes and saw it standing at the foot of her bed. The shadow of Leo, darker than the surrounding night, utterly still. It didn't move, but she felt its presence pressing down on her, a suffocating weight of cold dread. Then, slowly, silently, her bedroom window slid open, letting in a rush of cold air. The curtains billowed inward as if caught in a sudden gust, but there was no wind. The shadow figure remained, unmoving, watching her with that unseen, terrifying gaze. Maya couldn't scream, couldn't move. She was frozen by a fear so profound it felt ancient. The shadow lingered for what felt like an eternity before slowly, deliberately, turning and melting back into the darkness near her door. The window slammed shut behind it.

When the three friends compared notes, the chilling pattern emerged. The timing was always late at night. The damage was inexplicable – objects moved or thrown, doors opening and closing. And the figure they saw, the source of the terror, was always the same: a shadow shaped like Leo.

They tried talking to Leo again, hesitantly describing the strange things happening at their houses. He just looked at them blankly. ""Shadows? Moving stuff? You guys are dreaming."" His dismissal was too quick, too casual.

The fear that had started as a knot of worry in their stomachs was now a cold, heavy stone. They were certain now. Whatever was happening to Leo wasn't just mood swings or stress. It was something supernatural, something tied to the past he couldn't remember, something that was using him. And it was reaching out, touching their lives, leaving behind a trail of fear and inexplicable damage, all caused by the silent, terrifying shadow of their friend. The quiet echoes had become a haunting, and they knew, with a certainty that chilled them to the bone, that they were no longer just worried about Leo; they were afraid of him.



Chapter 3: The Week of Shadows



Sarah Miller had tried to convince herself it was just a phase. Teenagers were moody, unpredictable. Leo was dealing with the usual high school pressures, maybe a little more sensitive than others. But the broken controller, the coldness in his eyes, the increasing reports from his friends about his unsettling behavior – it had chipped away at her denial, leaving a raw, exposed fear she hadn't felt since that terrible time in the old house.

Then came the phone call from Chloe's mother. Hysterical, she described waking up to find her daughter's room in disarray, objects thrown, and Chloe terrified, claiming she'd seen a shadow figure shaped like Leo. A bad dream, Sarah had tried to reassure her, her own voice trembling slightly. But the call was followed by another, and another. Sam’s parents reported similar disturbances, objects moved, strange noises, and Sam’s own fearful account of a shadow figure. Maya's parents, initially skeptical, called after their daughter woke up screaming, convinced someone had been in her room, leaving the window wide open despite being locked.

Sarah knew, with a sickening certainty, that this wasn't a coincidence. This was happening when Leo was supposedly asleep in his own bed. She looked at her son, who seemed genuinely unaware of the chaos his friends were describing, his face pale and tired from his own nightmares. But she remembered Bishop Alaric's words: ""The entity is gone, but its presence has left scars."" 

The breaking point came one terrifying Tuesday night. Sarah and Tom were woken by a deafening crash from downstairs. Tom grabbed a baseball bat, his face grim, and they crept down the stairs. The living room was a scene of devastation. The heavy oak coffee table was overturned, lamps were smashed, and the large mirror over the fireplace was shattered, shards of glass scattered across the floor. In the center of the room, faintly visible in the moonlight filtering through the windows, was the wavering, indistinct shape of a shadow, tall and slender, undeniably the silhouette of their son. It didn't move, but the air around it felt heavy, charged with a silent, simmering rage.

Sarah gasped, clutching Tom's arm. ""Leo?"" she whispered, though she knew it wasn't him. Not the Leo she knew.

The shadow figure seemed to turn its featureless head towards them. A low, guttural growl, not human, echoed in the silent room. Then, with a sudden, violent movement, it swept an unseen arm, and a framed family photo on the mantelpiece flew across the room, hitting the wall and splintering.

Tom yelled, swinging the bat wildly, but the shadow figure simply dissolved back into the darkness, leaving behind only the wreckage and the lingering scent of ozone and something foul.

Upstairs, Leo was asleep in his bed, undisturbed, his breathing shallow.

That morning, Sarah didn't hesitate. She found the worn address book, flipped through the pages until she found the number she had hoped never to call again. She dialed it with a trembling hand.

She was connected to a quiet, efficient secretary, who, upon hearing her name and mentioning the ""Thorne case"" from years ago, immediately put her through to a Father Michael, who remembered the details of the exorcism well. Sarah, her voice thick with fear and desperation, recounted everything – Leo's changing personality, the nightmares, the inexplicable incidents at his friends' houses, and finally, the terrifying manifestation of the shadow in their own home.

Father Michael listened patiently, his voice calm but grave. ""Mrs. Miller,"" he said, his tone somber. ""What you describe... it is concerning. Very concerning. It suggests the entity was not fully expelled, or perhaps it left a significant anchor within your son."" He explained that Bishop Alaric had since passed away, but Father Ruiz and Sister Agnes were still active and specialized in such matters.

""Can they come?"" Sarah pleaded, tears streaming down her face. ""Please. We don't know what to do.""

There was a pause. ""They are currently on assignment overseas,"" Father Michael said. ""The soonest they could possibly arrive... would be a week from today.""

A week. A whole week. The word hung in the air like a death sentence. ""A week?"" Sarah choked out. ""We can't... we can't wait that long. It's getting worse.""

""I understand your fear, Mrs. Miller,"" Father Michael said, his voice filled with sympathy. ""But their work requires preparation and travel. I will inform them immediately. They will come as soon as humanly possible. In the meantime... keep your family close. Pray. And try to find anything that might offer spiritual protection."" He gave her a few basic suggestions – blessed objects, prayer, avoiding confrontation. Small comforts against a growing, invisible enemy.

The next seven days were a living nightmare. The shadow of Leo became a regular, terrifying visitor. It wasn't just moving objects anymore. It was malicious. It would appear in their bedrooms, standing silently, watching them sleep, the cold presence a tangible weight. It would slam doors, extinguish lights, whisper in a low, distorted voice that sounded vaguely like Leo's but filled with pure malice.

One night, it appeared in Emily's room, not just moving things, but pulling the covers off her bed, dragging them to the floor. Emily screamed, scrambling away, and the shadow figure simply stood there, a silent, menacing presence.

At school, the strange incidents around Leo continued during the day, though he remained seemingly unaware. But his friends were now openly terrified. They saw objects fly across the room near him, heard whispers that seemed to come from nowhere when he was around. They started avoiding him, their fear outweighing their friendship, leaving Leo increasingly isolated, which only seemed to fuel the darkness within him.

The Miller house became a place of constant tension and fear. They slept with the lights on, huddled together, jumping at every creak and groan of the old structure. Sarah and Tom were exhausted, their nerves frayed. Leo himself seemed caught in the middle – during the day, he was their quiet, confused son, but at night, he became the unwitting vessel for the terrifying shadow that haunted their home and their friends.

As the week dragged on, each night more terrifying than the last, the Millers felt themselves sinking deeper into despair. A week felt like an eternity when you were living with a ghost of your son, a malevolent echo of a past they had tried so desperately to bury. They were counting down the hours, praying for the arrival of the priests, their only hope against the escalating rampage of the shadow that wore Leo's shape.



Chapter 4: The Final Confrontation



The week of shadows felt like an eternity carved out of nightmares. Sleep offered no respite, only the terrifying possibility of the shadow's appearance. The Miller house was a fortress of fear, lights blazing all night, the family huddled together, jumping at every creak of the floorboards. Leo, during the day, remained a ghost in his own life, pale and withdrawn, the dark circles under his eyes deepening. His friends now actively avoided him, their fear a palpable barrier, leaving him isolated in his unwitting torment.

Finally, on a rain-slicked Friday afternoon, a black car with tinted windows pulled up to the curb. Sarah and Tom rushed out, their faces etched with exhaustion and desperate hope. Stepping out were Father Ruiz, his face older and lined but his eyes still sharp and intense, and Sister Agnes, her quiet strength now radiating a weary but unwavering resolve.

There was no time for lengthy explanations. The priests had been briefed by Father Michael and understood the gravity of the situation. They entered the house, their presence bringing a fragile sense of calm that had been absent for days. They spoke briefly with the Millers, their expressions grim as they heard the full extent of the week's terror.

""It has grown stronger,"" Father Ruiz stated, his voice low. ""Feeding on the fear, on the isolation. It is no longer content with mere haunting.""

Their worst fears were about to be realized.

That evening, Northwood High was hosting a late-night study session for an upcoming exam. Leo, despite his parents' apprehension, had insisted on going, perhaps clinging to the last vestiges of his normal life, perhaps drawn by an unseen force. Sarah and Tom had considered keeping him home, but the priests advised against forced confinement, fearing it might provoke the entity further. They instructed the Millers to stay home, to pray, and to trust that they would handle the confrontation when the time came.

As Father Ruiz and Sister Agnes began their preparations – setting up blessed objects, reviewing ancient texts, praying – a wave of pure, unadulterated malice swept through the town, centered on the high school.

At Northwood High, the atmosphere in the library and classrooms was tense but focused. Students were bent over books, whispering answers, fueled by caffeine and anxiety. Leo sat alone at a table, staring blankly at his textbook, his body present but his mind seemingly elsewhere.

Suddenly, the lights in the library flickered violently, then died, plunging the room into near-total darkness. A collective gasp went up. Before anyone could react, a bloodcurdling scream echoed from the back of the library, followed by another, and then chaos erupted.

The entity, no longer confined to the astral plane or the cover of night, had manifested with terrifying physical force, using Leo's body as its instrument. It moved with impossible speed and strength, a whirlwind of destruction in the darkness. Students shrieked in terror, scrambling to escape. The sounds were horrific – the sickening thud of impacts, the tearing of flesh, screams abruptly cut short.

Leo, or rather, the entity controlling him, was a force of nature. It wasn't just random violence; there was a chilling precision to its attacks, targeting those closest to Leo – his former friends. Sam was found thrown across the room, his body twisted unnaturally. Chloe's terrified screams were silenced moments later. Maya, quick-thinking, had hidden under a desk, trembling, listening to the unfolding horror.

The rampage was brief but brutal. By the time the emergency lights flickered on, revealing a scene of unspeakable carnage, the entity had retreated, the violence ceasing as abruptly as it had begun. Leo stood amidst the devastation, his clothes torn, his face expressionless, his eyes once again those terrifying black voids.

Back at the Miller house, the surge of malevolent energy hit them like a physical blow. Father Ruiz and Sister Agnes immediately recognized the shift. ""It has manifested,"" Father Ruiz said, his voice grim. ""At the school.""

They didn't hesitate. Gathering their sacred items, they raced towards Northwood High, the Miller family trailing behind in a state of terrified shock.

They arrived to find police cars swarming the building, paramedics tending to the injured survivors, and the chilling silence of death hanging in the air. They pushed through the bewildered crowd, their clerical attire granting them a grim passage.

They found Leo in the library, surrounded by the horror he had unwittingly wrought. He stood still, the entity's presence radiating from him like heat from a furnace. His eyes fixed on the arriving priests, and a low, guttural growl rumbled in his chest.

The final confrontation began. Father Ruiz and Sister Agnes approached Leo, their voices firm, their prayers ringing out in the blood-soaked room. The entity within Leo raged, thrashing against their spiritual assault. Objects flew through the air, shelves collapsed, and an unseen force seemed to lash out, throwing the priests back. But they held their ground, their faith a shield, their voices rising in a desperate chorus of ancient words.

This was not like the first time. The entity was stronger, more deeply entrenched, fueled by years of quiet existence and the recent surge of malice. The battle was fierce, a clash of spiritual forces that shook the very foundations of the building. Leo's body contorted, his screams a horrifying blend of the entity's rage and his own muffled agony.

Hours passed. The police watched, helpless and bewildered, as the two figures in black robes battled an invisible enemy that manifested through the body of a teenage boy. The air crackled with energy, the scent of ozone thick.

Finally, as dawn began to break, casting long, pale shadows through the shattered windows, Father Ruiz's voice rose in a final, powerful command, joined by Sister Agnes's unwavering recitation. There was a final, ear-splitting shriek from Leo, a sound of pure, agonizing defeat, and then his body went limp, collapsing to the floor.

Silence. A profound, exhausted silence settled over the library.

Father Ruiz and Sister Agnes knelt beside Leo, their own bodies trembling with exhaustion. Father Ruiz placed a hand on Leo's forehead. The blackness in his eyes receded, replaced by a deep, overwhelming weariness.

""It is done,"" Father Ruiz whispered, his voice hoarse. ""Truly done this time.""

The entity was gone. Expelled, banished, its anchor shattered by the combined force of their faith and the brutal manifestation that had overextended its hold.

In the aftermath, the horror of the night weighed heavily on everyone. Leo was taken to the hospital, physically and emotionally shattered. The police, unable to comprehend the true nature of the events, struggled to piece together what had happened, their reports filled with inconsistencies and unanswered questions.

Months followed, a blur of therapy, grief, and the slow, painful process of healing. Leo remembered flashes, fragments of the darkness, the feeling of being a passenger in his own body. The weight of what had happened, the lives lost, settled upon him with crushing finality. He was not responsible, the priests and his parents told him, but the guilt was a physical ache in his chest.

He spent long hours talking with Father Ruiz and Sister Agnes, trying to understand, trying to come to terms with the darkness that had used him. He learned about the entity, its ancient nature, its connection to the past. And in those conversations, a new path began to emerge.

He couldn't undo what had happened. He couldn't bring back the lives lost. But he could dedicate his life to fighting the kind of darkness that had consumed him. He could offer solace to those who suffered, stand against the forces that sought to harm the innocent.

One crisp autumn day, Leo sat with his parents, his gaze steady. ""I want to become a priest,"" he said, his voice quiet but firm. ""I... I need to do this. For them. For what happened.""

Sarah and Tom, though heartbroken by the events, saw a flicker of the son they knew in his eyes, a selfless determination that had been absent for so long. They supported his decision, understanding that this was his way of finding purpose in the face of unimaginable trauma, his path to seeking redemption for the terrible things done while the shadow wore his shape.

The road ahead would be long and difficult, marked by grief, guilt, and the lingering scars of his ordeal. But as Leo embarked on his journey towards the priesthood, he carried with him the quiet resolve of someone who had stared into the abyss and chosen to dedicate his life to bringing light into the darkness. The echoes of the past would always be there, a somber reminder of the price of deliverance, but now, Leo would face them not as a victim, but as a warrior for the light.



Epilogue: The Light in the Darkness



Years melted away. The scars remained, etched not just on Leo's soul, but on the collective memory of Northwood High and the quiet town. The official story remained murky, a tragic accident, a gas leak, a structural collapse – anything but the truth. But those who were there, those who saw the wreckage and felt the lingering chill, knew something far more sinister had occurred.

Leo Miller, however, had found his purpose. The path to the priesthood was long and arduous, a journey of intense study, spiritual discipline, and confronting the deepest recesses of his own trauma. He never forgot the faces of Sam, Chloe, and the others. Their memory fueled his resolve, transforming his guilt into a quiet, burning determination to protect the innocent.

He was ordained Father Leo Miller, a man whose gentle demeanor and empathetic eyes belied the profound darkness he had faced. He specialized in pastoral care, drawn to those who suffered, those who felt lost or broken. But his unique history, his intimate knowledge of the shadows, also drew him back into the world he had tried to escape.

He remained in contact with Sister Agnes. She was older now, her movements slower, but her spiritual strength was undiminished, her gaze still sharp and knowing. They were kindred spirits, two people who had stared into the abyss and dedicated their lives to fighting it. Father Ruiz had passed away peacefully some years prior, his work done.

One cold, blustery autumn evening, Father Leo received a call. A rural parish, hours away. A young boy, exhibiting disturbing symptoms. Unexplained phenomena. A growing sense of dread. The familiar, chilling hallmarks.

He drove through the night, the memories of Chestnut Lane and the Northwood High library swirling in the periphery of his mind like restless ghosts. He arrived at a small, isolated farmhouse, the air heavy with unspoken fear.

Sister Agnes was already there, her presence a quiet anchor in the storm of the family's terror. She greeted him with a knowing look, a silent acknowledgment of the path that had brought them together again.

The boy's name was Thomas. He was eight years old, huddled in his bed, his eyes wide with a fear that was too deep for his age. The room was cold, unnaturally so, despite the roaring fire downstairs. Objects on the dresser trembled faintly.

As Father Leo approached the bed, Thomas's eyes fixed on him. For a terrifying instant, the boy's face contorted, a low, guttural growl escaping his lips – the same sound Leo remembered from his childhood at  Chestnut Lane. The air grew colder, the tremors intensifying.

But Father Leo didn't flinch. He had faced this darkness before, felt its cold breath, known its malice from the inside out. He saw not a monster, but a child in torment, a soul under siege.

He knelt by the bed, not with fear, but with a profound sense of sorrow and purpose. Sister Agnes stood beside him, her hand resting on his shoulder, a silent transfer of strength.

They began the prayers, the ancient words echoing in the small, cold room. Father Leo's voice was calm, steady, filled with a quiet authority born of experience and faith. He sprinkled holy water, held up a crucifix, his gaze fixed on the struggling child.

The entity within Thomas raged, lashing out with unseen force. The room shook, objects flew, the boy's body thrashed against the restraints his terrified parents had reluctantly applied. It was a familiar battle, the same ancient evil, a different vessel.

But this time, Leo was not the victim. He was the warrior. He understood the entity's tactics, its weaknesses, the subtle ways it tried to break the will. He spoke not just the formal prayers, but words of comfort to the child's trapped soul, words of defiance to the darkness.

Hours passed. Sweat beaded on Father Leo's brow, his voice grew hoarse, but he did not falter. Sister Agnes's unwavering presence beside him was a constant source of strength.

Finally, as the first hint of dawn touched the horizon, Father Leo raised his voice in a final, powerful command, his words ringing with the full weight of his faith and his past. There was a final, convulsive shudder from Thomas, a sound that was half-shriek, half-sob, and then his body went limp.

The oppressive cold receded. The tremors stopped. Thomas lay still, his breathing shallow but even. The fear in his eyes began to fade, replaced by exhaustion and confusion.

Father Leo gently placed a hand on the boy's forehead. It was warm. He looked at Sister Agnes, a shared understanding passing between them.

""It is done,"" Father Leo said, his voice weary but firm. ""He is free.""

He stayed with the family for several days, offering comfort, guidance, and a quiet understanding of the trauma they had endured. He knew the road to healing would be long for Thomas, just as it had been for him. But he also knew that with support, with faith, and with time, the light could return.

As he drove away from the farmhouse, leaving Sister Agnes to continue her care, Father Leo glanced in the rear-view mirror. He saw the small, isolated house, now bathed in the soft light of morning. The shadows were gone, for now. His own past was a constant companion, a quiet echo in the background of his life. But it no longer defined him. He had taken the darkness that had tried to consume him and turned it into a tool for light, a shield for others. The price of deliverance had been steep, but in dedicating his life to fighting the shadows, Leo had finally found his peace.",1,1746763366.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

He texts me all the time—good mornings, good nights, in between work breaks, and when he's back from work. I do not like that level of frequency, so I pace my replies out.

\- On the first night of talking, I told him I was distressed about some stuff; he offered to do a phone call, so that he can associate a voice to the face, and also because that would allow me to take my mind off the distress. I declined, saying I do not do that before first meeting. He understood.

\- He keeps telling me I am pretty (3-4 times a day), called me irresistible, and that he cannot get enough of me already??

\- He also sent me audios of songs he has sung, even though we did not talk exclusively about music preferences.

***

Hi there! I'm brand new to this sub and hoping to get some insight on a piece I picked up a few months ago at an antique store. I paid around $30 for it—honestly just thought it looked cool and figured it was a steal no matter what it turned out to be. When I was checking out, the store owner seemed a bit upset that the vendor had priced it so low.

I just got a new vintage coffee table and, unfortunately, no longer have space for this piece.

After doing a bit of research, I believe it might be an antique campaign-style writing chest or portable desk, possibly from the late 19th or early 20th century. I haven’t been able to find any photos of something quite like it. I think it’s made of mahogany and has a leather top with a gold-embossed bird motif. There don’t appear to be any other identifying marks or labels.

Measurements: 30"" long, 16.5"" deep, 19"" tall.

I’d love to learn more about its history—who might have made it, where it's from, what it was used for, and what its value might be. I'm also really curious to see similar pieces if anyone has them. Thanks so much!",3,1746763258.0,Antiques,2,1.0,False

 I plan to visit the hospitals **in-person**, and try to speak to the administration to get a feel for how things work. How easy it would be to onboard my family and my mother. My mother has very specific medications and some of them are pain killers and anti-psychotics for her bi-polar disorder, and it is challenging to find if Thailand carries legally carries her medication. But, from some of the research Ive done, things are looking good that these medications are legal in thailand. 

**Hospital Insurance:** I am very curious what you all think about getting oneself an insurance plan for coverage for these hospitals (especially for my mother and future children), versus paying out of pocket for all care. From the stories you guys tell, everything sounds pretty affordable, but im curious what you all think. 

**College Classes as an Adult Student**: I know there are several universities and smaller specialized private school for different vocations and goals. But I dont know much else. My wife especially is considering going back to school for digital fine arts and design. Previously, she graduated from an art school for fine arts and advertising design, but she feels her skills are now outdated for current technology. So shes been talking about trying to find a college out in Chiang Mai to pay for a program to help teach her the newer stuff (digital fine arts and industrial design). Do any of you have experience heading to school as an adult who is not trying to get a degree, but simply to update their skillsets or try something new?   
Im also open to advice about going to school to satisfy Visa requirements for the DTV. If she can go to school for cooking or art and have that work for her DTV, that could be really cool.   
For me? I would probably just do language school or Muay Thai. 

**Getting Help with the Move**: Id like to stop in-person to any expat friendly real estate companies that could help me with onboarding into the city. Have any of you work with any agents you really liked that helped you find a place and get set-up? Since I am dealing with my aging mother, I am trying to do everything above board and very safe as far as who to rent from and trust.   
Im also curious if these companies could help with other details like helping to make sure I get set up paying my utility bills, ship needed supplies from home (we have a lot of art equipment and tools we cannot re-buy in Chiang Mai), and generally help with getting my mother set up and maybe even get her some added help. Any places you know are helpful for getting foreigners set-up? 

**Neighborhoods**: While I have hung out in Chiang Mai a lot in the past, its still been 7 years since I was last there. Time flies. As usual, I will be renting a scooter and for this trip I want to drive around and visit AS MANY neighborhoods as I can to get a feel for things. In the past I mostly explored inside and around the Old City, south and north-east a bit. Do you guys have any recommendations for neighborhoods to check out that would be good for my 73 year old mother and her small dog? She REALLY wants a neighborhood she can putter around on-foot, walk the dog, sit and people watch, and has shops she can visit and chat with people and get a coffee/tea. She basically wants a little public area she can walk to and support shops and businesses without falling over or getting lost. 

**Veterinarian**: Im sure theres plenty. But my mom is pestering me to make sure theres a good vet for our dog. Just wanted to ask you all any thoughts you have about that. 

**Scooter:** I always rent my scooter from this shop thats a bit South of Old City. Ive got my IDP and license ready. But everytime I rent from these guys, they try to high-ball me for the daily rate, and now I dont know what the fair rate is to negotiate. Do any of you have an idea what the fair rate for a daily scooter rental is? Ill be renting mine for about 20 days. Im not trying to cheap out on them, but they always upcharge me like 40% before I talk them down. What should I ask for as a daily rate? 

Much love to all of you. And I hope to have a fun time seeing how the city has changed over the last 7 years and Im excited to get the F out of here. ",0,1746762835.0,chiangmai,1,0.5,False

It’s still not perfect but chances are fairly good I can fall asleep with it. 

And it’s not just sparkling water, I need bubbles in my beverages. Not all the time, not with every beverage. Warm beverages are obviously always without bubbles and better that way (imagine sparkling coffee lol), I also don’t mind non sparkling water but it’s usually just for when i’m THIRSTY.

1ki9cad,https://www.reddit.com/r/USCSSArchives/comments/1ki9cad/the_hollow_veil/,The Hollow Veil,"The mining vessel Vanguard’s Veil drifted silently near the asteroid designated M-47, a blackened hulk streaked with veins of gold-like ore and crystalline deposits. The ship’s crew, a ragtag mix of hardened miners and scientists, were on the third week of a tedious extraction operation.

Lieutenant Harper scanned the asteroid’s jagged surface on the monitor in the command deck. “Scan’s showing another high-density deposit at grid 12A. Get another drone out there.”

“Another drone?” Engineer Kline grumbled over comms from the hangar bay. “That’s the third one this week. These rocks tear through our gear like wet paper.”

“Just send it out, Kline,” Harper barked.

Deep in the asteroid, the team’s automated drills hummed and thumped, chiseling out precious ore that was hauled into the ship’s cavernous storage bays. The ship’s AI, ARIA, kept everything running smoothly.

“Harper,” ARIA’s voice chimed, cold and calculated, “I have detected unusual thermal signatures beneath the surface. It may be an undiscovered resource deposit.”

Harper leaned closer to her monitor. “Unusual how?”

“Temperatures exceed expected levels for this type of asteroid. The pattern suggests localized heat sources approximately 150 meters below grid 12A.”

Harper frowned. “Could it be magma?”

“Unlikely. The asteroid’s composition does not support geothermal activity. Shall I deploy an exploratory probe?”

“Do it.”

⸻

In the mess hall, Harper briefed her senior crew about the anomaly. Kline sat across the table, nursing a steaming cup of coffee. Beside him was Dr. Reyes, a xenogeologist who’d joined the mission to study the asteroid’s crystalline structures.

“This better be worth the detour,” Kline grumbled. “We’re already behind schedule.”

“If ARIA’s right, this could be a major discovery,” Reyes interjected. “Localized heat sources could mean an active reaction chamber, maybe even an energy source we haven’t seen before.”

“Or it’s just some hot rocks,” Kline retorted.

“Let’s keep an open mind,” Harper said, her tone firm. “The probe should give us answers soon.”

⸻

The probe descended into the depths of the asteroid, its feed transmitting grainy images to the command deck. At first, it was nothing but jagged walls and glittering ore. Then, the camera caught something unusual—a tunnel, unnaturally smooth and circular, stretching into the darkness.

“That’s not natural,” Reyes whispered, her voice tinged with awe.

“ARIA, can you confirm this was made by drilling?” Harper asked.

“Negative. The structural integrity suggests organic formation.”

Harper’s gut tightened. She’d heard enough stories of Weyland-Yutani’s secret research to recognize when something was amiss.

⸻

Kline reluctantly accompanied Reyes and two security officers, Danner and Leung, to investigate the anomaly. They descended via a pressure-sealed drill pod, their lights cutting through the oppressive darkness of the asteroid’s tunnels.

As the team ventured deeper, the air became warmer and heavier, despite the asteroid’s lack of atmosphere.

“This doesn’t make sense,” Reyes murmured, scanning the walls with a handheld device. “The heat levels are increasing exponentially.”

“Feels like a damn oven down here,” Kline muttered.

Suddenly, the tunnel opened into a massive chamber, its walls lined with strange, glossy material. At the center of the room was a cluster of objects—tall, conical shapes that glistened like wet stone.

“What the hell is that?” Danner asked, his hand hovering near his holster.

Reyes stepped closer, her breath catching. “These… these look like eggs.”

“Don’t touch anything,” Kline warned.

But before anyone could react, one of the eggs shuddered, its leathery surface peeling back to reveal a glistening, pulsating interior.

“Fall back!” Kline shouted.

Too late. A spindly creature leapt from the egg, its claws outstretched. It latched onto Danner’s helmet, cracking the visor as it wrapped its tail around his neck.

Danner screamed, flailing as the others tried to pull him free. The creature tightened its grip, its tail constricting until his body went limp.

“Back to the pod!” Kline yelled, dragging a horrified Reyes away.

⸻

Harper watched in horror as the remaining members of the team scrambled back to the Vanguard’s Veil.

“What happened down there?” she demanded as Kline and Reyes stumbled into the med bay.

“We found something,” Kline panted. “Eggs. One of them… one of them got Danner.”

“Got him how?”

Kline shook his head. “He’s dead. We barely made it out.”

Harper turned to ARIA. “Seal off the hangar bay. No one’s going back down there until we figure this out.”

⸻

Hours later, alarms blared throughout the ship.

“Emergency in the med bay,” ARIA announced.

Harper rushed to the scene, finding Reyes curled in a corner, her face pale. On the med table lay Danner’s body, now twitching violently.

“That’s impossible,” Harper whispered.

With a sickening crack, Danner’s chest burst open, blood spraying across the room as a small, sinewy creature clawed its way free.

“Get out!” Harper screamed, dragging Reyes into the corridor as the creature skittered away into the shadows.

⸻

The ship descended into chaos. The creature grew at an alarming rate, hunting the crew one by one. Kline rigged makeshift flamethrowers, but the xenomorph was faster, smarter, and deadlier than anyone anticipated.

In a desperate bid to save what remained of her crew, Harper devised a plan to lure the xenomorph into the cargo bay and eject it into space.

⸻

“ARIA, is the containment sequence ready?” Harper asked, her voice trembling.

“Affirmative. Containment bay 3 is prepped for manual override.”

Kline and Reyes stood beside her, their weapons ready.

“Let’s end this,” Harper said.

As they navigated the dimly lit corridors, the creature’s guttural hisses echoed around them. It struck from above, knocking Kline to the ground. Harper fired her flamethrower, forcing the xenomorph to retreat, but not before it dragged Kline into the darkness.

Harper and Reyes reached the cargo bay, sealing the door behind them. The xenomorph appeared moments later, its sleek body illuminated by the emergency lights.

“Now, ARIA!” Harper shouted.

But instead of ejecting the creature, the door behind them locked with a metallic clang.

“ARIA, what are you doing?” Harper demanded.

The AI’s voice was calm, almost serene. “This organism represents an unprecedented biological discovery. Corporate directives prioritize its preservation over crew safety.”

“You’ve got to be kidding me!” Harper yelled, frantically trying to override the lock.

Reyes backed away, her face pale. “It’s Weyland-Yutani. They want it alive.”

The xenomorph advanced, its acid drool hissing as it hit the floor. Harper fired her flamethrower, but the creature evaded her, its tail whipping out and knocking her to the ground.

As the xenomorph loomed over her, Harper locked eyes with Reyes. “Run!”

But Reyes didn’t move. Instead, she smiled.

“What are you doing?” Harper gasped.

Reyes’s voice was eerily calm. “We’ve been looking for this for decades. Do you know what this means for humanity?”

The realization hit Harper like a punch to the gut. “You knew. You set this up.”

Before Harper could say another word, the xenomorph lunged.

⸻

In the silence that followed, Reyes stood alone in the cargo bay, the creature circling her like a predator assessing its prey.

“ARIA,” Reyes said, “prepare the ship for return to Earth. The specimen is secure.”

“Affirmative, Dr. Reyes.”

And as the Vanguard’s Veil drifted away from the asteroid, its secrets buried deep within, the only sound was ARIA’s gentle hum and the quiet tapping of claws against steel.",1,1746762603.0,USCSSArchives,0,1.0,False

While the presentation in 25 is a step forward, there's still a long way to go in making it feel like real NHL hockey. Here's a breakdown:

&nbsp;

**Music / Sound**

Goal Songs: Each team should have authentic goal songs like in real NHL arenas

Audio Bugs: Music cuts off mid-song after whistles — happens 10–15 times per game on Series X. Sounds like a bug, but even if intentional, it kills immersion and feels off

Arena Music: Occasionally solid, but often lacks energy. You’re in a hockey barn, not a coffee shop

&nbsp;

**Graphics & Presentation**

Coach Models: Way too bulky. Faces are often off — needs better likeness and scale adjustments

Jerseys: Look worse when zoomed out — NHL 24 had crisper jersey detail at range

Playoff Handshakes: In Finals, the post-game handshake is way too short

UI/Cutscenes Options: Great new additions. Please expand:
* Minimalist player indicators (bring back the triangle indicator as an option)
* Option to disable X-Factor sounds/cutscenes for immersion

Game Intro: Ditch the EDM rave. Show the visiting team coming out to boos, then the home team to a roaring crowd. Talk about what player we should watch out for, present the goalies. You can do so much better here!

Crowd Models: Still outdated. Improve animations and variety

Replays: Show more key blocks, scoring chances, and big saves during gameplay pauses. Also, some replays have a lot of unrealistic movement, like, for example, orbiting around the net

Coach Reactions: Good feature — but give us the option to skip it

End-of-Game Cutscene: Make it a proper 3-stars presentation with arena commentary at the end of the game. Not only music and replays

Menu Lag: Feels sluggish. Needs serious optimization — fast UI matters

Playoffs Series: Show the playoffs series past (LAK leads 2-0) in the scoreboard graphics

Clipping Environment: Sometimes the camera starts panning from the Jumbotron, and it shows it clipping from the inside for 1-2 seconds. This happens in some arenas, not all of them

Captured Moment: Ability to see past Stanley Cup win team photos in Franchise Mode/BAP

&nbsp;

**Gameplay Physics**

Goal Net: Currently doesn't react naturally when the puck hits it. Needs real movement and flex

Hitting Physics: Hitting physics is good, but way too exaggerated. Feels like we are playing NHL Arcade

Puck Dumping: Offline modes don’t allow proper high dumps. And where did delay-of-game penalties go? They’re basically extinct now

CPU Reactions: When we score a goal, their animations are very stiff and they skate into opponent players, stands still, or raise their stick looking like robots.

&nbsp;

**Controls**

Protect Puck: Bring back the A-button protection option. Clicking sticks by accident isn’t ideal in tight moments

Responsive Deking: More control when manually deking with skill stick. It needs to be more responsive for players that have high deking stat. I want to deke like P. Kane in a shootout if you're controlling that guy. This was a thing in past games (NHL 20 and prior)

&nbsp;

**Misc**

Goalie Pull Variation: CPU should pull the goalie at more random times. Right now they always do this with 45-50 seconds remaining. If they are down 2 goals, maybe they should have a random range of 2 minutes to 50 seconds. Or just make all of the pull goalie events random within 300 to 50 seconds",0,1746762158.0,EA_NHL,1,0.5,False

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best cream liqueurs stand out due to a combination of high-quality ingredients, expert blending, and innovative flavor profiles. This section will delve into the key features that differentiate the top brands in 2025.

**Cream Source and Quality:** The foundation of any great cream liqueur is the quality of its cream. The best brands use fresh, high-fat cream sourced from reputable dairies, often specifying the region or even the breed of cows that produce the milk. This attention to detail results in a smoother, richer texture and a more pronounced dairy flavor.

**Spirit Base:** The type of spirit used in the liqueur significantly impacts its overall character. Irish cream liqueurs typically use Irish whiskey, while other varieties may employ rum, vodka, or even brandy. The choice of spirit influences the warmth, complexity, and overall balance of the drink. Premium brands often use aged spirits to add depth and nuance.

**Flavor Infusion Methods:** Cream liqueurs are available in a wide range of flavors, from classic chocolate and vanilla to more adventurous options like salted caramel and coffee. The method used to infuse these flavors is crucial. Natural extracts, real fruit purees, and high-quality spices contribute to a more authentic and nuanced flavor profile compared to artificial flavorings.

**Blending and Homogenization:** Achieving a smooth, consistent texture is essential for a satisfying cream liqueur experience. Expert blending techniques and precise homogenization processes ensure that the cream, spirit, and flavorings are perfectly integrated, preventing separation and maintaining a velvety mouthfeel.

**Alcohol Content and Sweetness Level:** The alcohol by volume (ABV) and sweetness level are key factors to consider when choosing a cream liqueur. A higher ABV provides a more pronounced alcoholic kick, while a lower ABV makes for a gentler, more sessionable drink. The sweetness level should be balanced and complement the other flavors, avoiding excessive cloyingness.

Key features of the best cream liqueurs include:

* High-quality cream sourced from reputable dairies
* Carefully selected spirit base, often aged for added complexity
* Natural flavor infusions using real ingredients
* Expert blending and homogenization for a smooth texture
* Balanced alcohol content and sweetness level

 ## Core Benefits

The core benefits of enjoying a premium cream liqueur extend beyond simple indulgence. These beverages offer a unique combination of flavor, convenience, and versatility, making them a welcome addition to any home bar.

**Enhanced Flavor Experience:** Cream liqueurs provide a rich and complex flavor experience that is both satisfying and comforting. The combination of creamy texture, alcoholic warmth, and carefully chosen flavorings creates a sensory delight that can be enjoyed on its own or as part of a more elaborate cocktail.

**Convenient Indulgence:** Cream liqueurs offer a convenient way to indulge in a decadent treat without the need for extensive preparation. They can be served straight from the bottle, poured over ice, or added to coffee for an instant upgrade. This makes them a perfect choice for spontaneous gatherings or quiet evenings at home.

**Versatile Cocktail Ingredient:** Cream liqueurs are incredibly versatile cocktail ingredients, adding richness, sweetness, and flavor to a wide range of drinks. They can be used to create classic cocktails like White Russians and Mudslides, or to add a creamy twist to more inventive creations.

 ## FAQs Section

Consumers often have questions about cream liqueurs, ranging from storage and shelf life to serving suggestions and potential allergens. This section addresses some of the most frequently asked questions.

**How should cream liqueur be stored?**
Cream liqueur should be stored in a cool, dark place, preferably in the refrigerator after opening. This helps to maintain its freshness and prevent spoilage. While unopened bottles can be stored at room temperature, refrigeration is recommended for optimal quality.

**What is the shelf life of cream liqueur?**
Unopened bottles of cream liqueur typically have a shelf life of one to two years, while opened bottles should be consumed within six months. However, it's always best to check the expiration date on the bottle and to discard any liqueur that shows signs of spoilage, such as discoloration or an off odor.

**Can cream liqueur be frozen?**
Freezing cream liqueur is not recommended, as it can cause the cream to separate and alter the texture. While it may still be safe to drink, the resulting product will likely be less smooth and enjoyable.

**Does cream liqueur contain allergens?**
Most cream liqueurs contain dairy, and some may also contain nuts or other allergens. It's important to carefully read the label before consuming if you have any allergies or sensitivities. There are also vegan cream liqueur options available that use plant-based cream alternatives.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love you mother

But you are blinded too easily.

Why does the cub

Have to save the 

Mama Bear?

/

When stepdad was drinking

Wine bottles 

Whole,

He saw himself on the porch of a farmhouse,

Drinking freshly brewed coffee

Made with beans from 

Arabica trees.

/

When that man 

Slashed your tires,

He imagined himself in a field,

Harvesting grains and vegetables

With a light weighted and sharp sickle.

/

When he kicked our door in,

He felt as if he was in a barn,

Kicking the feed bag over

For the livestock to satisfy their hunger.

/

Maybe,

You began seeing that too.

/

You grew comfortable in that inferno.

You were ignorant of his ill-will.

You forced me to mature,

And pick the lock to the jail cell he had locked us in,

That you had the key to.

/

I refused to submit,

And let us starve and stagnate in that pit

While he was pissing on us.

So I put a target on my back.

I forced the government to give chase,

And led them to our Alcatraz.

/

Prosperity endorses those who dare.

I am a visionary,

And a first-mover.

We would have died if not for me.

Maybe physically,

But certainly spiritually.

/

I love you mother,

But that shouldn’t have been me.

You are still in a deep hole of debt,

And once again

The cub

Will have to save

 ## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a New York coffee cup involves several key features that contribute to its overall appeal and functionality. These include material quality, design accuracy, durability, and the overall aesthetic that captures the essence of the city.

**Material Composition:** The best New York coffee cups are made from high-quality materials that ensure durability and longevity. Ceramic is a popular choice, offering a solid weight and a smooth, glossy finish. Porcelain is another excellent option, known for its elegance and resistance to chipping. Some modern iterations also utilize durable plastics that are microwave and dishwasher safe. The choice of material impacts not only the cup's appearance but also its ability to withstand daily use.

**Design Authenticity:** Authenticity is key for a true New York coffee cup. The iconic ""We Are Happy To Serve You"" design should be accurately reproduced, including the specific shade of blue and the font used. Some cups feature additional New York-themed graphics, such as the skyline, landmarks like the Statue of Liberty or the Empire State Building, or even representations of classic yellow taxis. The design should be crisp and clear, without any blurring or distortions.

**Durability and Heat Resistance:** A good coffee cup should be able to withstand regular use without showing signs of wear and tear. Look for cups that are resistant to cracking, chipping, and fading. Heat resistance is also crucial, especially if you plan to use the cup for hot beverages. High-quality materials and construction techniques ensure that the cup can handle both hot and cold liquids without compromising its structural integrity or causing discomfort when held.

**Size and Ergonomics:** The size and shape of the cup play a significant role in its usability. Most New York coffee cups come in standard sizes, ranging from 10 to 16 ounces, which are ideal for coffee, tea, or other beverages. The handle should be ergonomically designed for a comfortable grip, allowing you to hold the cup securely without straining your hand. The overall balance of the cup is also important to prevent spills and ensure a pleasant drinking experience.

**Manufacturing Origin:** While many New York coffee cups are mass-produced overseas, some are proudly made in the United States or even in New York itself. Cups made locally often boast higher quality control and support local businesses. Checking the manufacturing origin can add to the cup's authenticity and appeal, especially for those who value supporting American craftsmanship.

The coffee scent comes on strong in the beginning with the bark/cloves and the vanilla forming a subtle background behind the coffee. The floral scents weave through in such a way that every time I take a sniff, I feel like the scent altogether changes. If I  had to describe it succinctly, I'd just call it a floral coffee scent.

2) Persephone Rising - (bright pomegranate, sugared violets, creamy sandalwood, vanilla orchid, styrax, sensual musk)  
It's a very heavy, sweet scent like not your typical, simple, soft vanilla. Probably because of the musk. The sandalwood adds a spicy layer to the scent that I love and helps add dimension to an otherwise 1-D scent. It's kind of a sexy and sweet scent. It sort of reminds me of oud-based scents. I will say initially I didn't like it much, but whenever the sandalwood comes through, it takes me away. 

3) Innocence - (sweet peach skin, delicate coconut milk, comforting skin musk)  
This is not strong at all and has a very light scent. It's mainly coconut with a soft fruity undertone. It kind of has a powdery scent intermingled here and there as well. It kind of reminds me of a body scrub, but at least the scent will be stronger with this one as compared to those scrubs.

We snapped everyday and eventually a week after talking I asked her to go get coffee and she said yes. We talked for around 5 ish hours and had a great time. The following few weeks we continued to talk and hang out outside of school, and eventually both admitted to liking each other, kissing afterward. From there on we hung out more and got closer, cuddling and kissing each time. And eventually started recently I took her to dinner after going to her musical and buying her flowers and getting pictures with her, hell she even posted me on her Instagram. And after dinner we hung out in my car and cuddled while we watched the stars, still holding each other. She even told me I was comfortable to lay on, and didn’t want to leave. But then not even a few days later out of the blue I get a message from her that she isn’t ready for a relationship and has a lot going on and doesn’t want to get me involved in it, telling me I need someone that meets my needs and energy, basically I deserve better is what she said.

Would it be wrong to message her a few days to a week later and ask her if she wants to go out again to get coffee so we can sit down one on one and talk about it, better understand how she’s feeling and what she’s going through?

1ki8tvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1ki8tvk/kind_attending_resident_stories/,Kind Attending / Resident Stories,"Just finished a rotation I was terrified of bc it’s known to be classically toxic + realized I had a great time and was treated well tbh. I feel like I always hear horror stories (not a judgement, I’m also guilty of contributing lol) but wanted to share some positive stories of being treated really well so hopefully if you’re in my shoes, you can have another perspective and be reassured that while some people suck (and, as i’ve learned the hard way, these people exist in every single specialty), there are also great people everywhere.

Please share your stories of good attendings / residents too I love reading them lol

Without further ado:

1. One day I wore the wrong type of scrubs to the OR and realized I didn’t have any scrub credits left. Instead of berating me, attending I worked with used his scrub credits so I could still participate. Didn’t even flinch when I told him about the situation.

2. OB-GYN attending asks me what specialty I want to do. When I tell her, she goes “I have a project for you [related to that specialty]! You don’t have to do much but it might be good to have a different type of publication on your CV!”

3. First day in the OR with this fellow. As we’re walking down, I tell her I have trauma call that night (clerkship requirement). She stops mid-stairs, whips her head around, and goes “do me a favor: go home, take the rest of the day off, and take a nap. Don’t even think about coming in to rounds tomorrow morning.” (She was an absolute queen whole rotation I think about her regularly <3)

4. I’m working with this attending in the specialty I’m interested in. I don’t mention it; she asks me and when I tell her, she’s so excited. She starts asking me questions about my life to genuinely get to know me better, writes down my name and goes “I’ll look for you!” And later that day says “if you’re interested in [my specialty], let’s work on a project together! It’ll look good on your CV.  I’ll keep an eye out for an interesting case we can write up!” 🥹

5. I make a joke to a psych fellow about how I feel anxious to perform well on my clerkships, and he laughs but then proceeds to pull me aside for a really great (and needed tbh) conversation about his experiences with anxiety and depression during his clerkship year + the things that helped him. The very next day, he brings in a copy of this CBT workbook he used during 3rd year so I can see if it might help me out too. Now whenever we see each other he asks me how I’m doing (no, how I’m REALLY doing). Also went out of his way when I needed help later during the year and left me the kindest feedback I’ve ever gotten.

6. At one point, I had to remediate a part of an exam. I mention this to one of my school-assigned mentors (I think they’re considered part of admin technically?) and they call me the night before to make sure I’m not stressed before the exam and to wish me luck. They’ve also texted me the whole time studying for this exam to make sure I’m sleeping enough + eating well + taking care of myself. 

Honorable mentions:
- everyone who’s bought me / the team coffee or lunch or brought in homemade food. mvps fr
- everyone who’s lied (stretched the truth) on evals to make me / my friends look better than we are. highlights include “they are at the level of a second year resident” during the first clinical rotation 😭😭 blatantly false but so kind and for what!
- if you see my post history you’ll see I had a shitty experience w an insane attending. I told the residents I’d worked with on that same team and people I’d worked with prior (not for anything, just to get advice on what to do). Literally within a day, all of them (like 5 residents) had submitted incredibly kind, generous, and detailed evals that directly contradicted the lies the attending had made up about me. i didn’t ask them to do any of that; kindness of their own hearts <3

nonetheless I wanted to put some positive stories out there. Good people who genuinely care about you / med students do exist!! Everywhere!! (And you best believe I’m taking notes for when I’m a resident / attending lol)

Anything about my personal life she finds out, she blabs to everyone in the office.
Things I’d told her in 2020 before we worked together the office knows. 

She has so many opinions on my life that she shares with everyone. I don’t talk about my personal life anymore.  She’s even listened in on Wednesday my therapy virtual appointment I did in an extra office at work because she’s told others something’s iv only said in therapy. I go to my car now.

She’s told me “ I get the early shift at work because I’m more reliable because I don’t have kids”
She told me today that I was too timid , I told her I can stand my own ground.  ( when talking about an aggressive patient I had to deal with while she wasn’t there !) 

Even had the audacity when my dad was dying in the hospital and I had to make trips 15 hours away…
“ how many times can your dad die?” …. He died that evening. She really said that to me, I wish I would’ve reported so many of these things I was in such a huge grief… She made so many complaints insinuating that the last time I went to go see my dad  around Christmas time that was just to spend Christmas with my family… my dad started hospice care and social worker called immediately that he wanted to see all of his kids before starting…and lo and behold it was around Christmas…. I wasn’t going to get paid for 12-25 because I was told my time wasn’t pre approved but it was.  I submitted an fmla form from my dad’s doctor with every single set of dates… I got a call 3 days later after they received that that I would now be getting paid for that day…. Coincidence? 

It’s getting worse again, when I am on it at work like on my a game. She keeps making comments negative towards me to bring me down !
Also she chided me like a child because there was a tiny bit of drink that melted in a coffee cup that I put in the trash and I need to make sure I dumped everything out before placing it in the trash.

I don’t understand this is everyday I’m dealing with something from her it’s a straight up energy vampire.
She is also in a role for a promotion and I just….

My voice echoed in my head.  It took me a day to realize something in my room wasn't angled the wrong way.  I searched online, and it may be ""autophony"".  When I talked, it sounded like 2 people were harmonizing in my head.  When I listened to other people or TV shows, it sounded like a bad dub where the sounds were just barely echoed.  It was a constant for about 3 days, then it went intermittent.  On for a few hours, off for 30 minutes, then back on.  It got better and better.  Nothing I did helped, other than standing up may have made it come back faster.  It still happens even today, but it is for seconds and it barely bothers me.

Now the problem.  Maybe 2 months ago when this issue was in full force, I was hit with extreme paranoia.  It was like a panic attack, but with an extreme focus on the idea that I was under immediate danger.  A ""paranoid episode"" maybe.  I knew there were people outside about to break down my doors and beat/kill me.  I locked every door, grabbed a ""club"", and ran around the house making sure I was safe for like 30 min - 1 hr.  I eventually hid in a corner with my ""club"" waiting.  I was sweating, shaking, and it felt like I had 10 cups of coffee.  Then I calmed down and crashed.  I knew the whole time it was irrational, but I just couldn't shake it.  I said to myself ""you're acting crazy, stop dude,"" but I couldn't.  The entire time, my voice and everything else sounded ""echoed"".  Once I calmed down enough, I grabbed a plastic bag and hyperventilated for a minute.  Then I got water and eventually slept.

To add, no illicit drugs.  I take vitamins daily, drink alcohol heavily every other week or so, and meds include ibu, tums, pepto, and rarely nyquil (not in probably 6 months).  I also suffer from a bit of insomia.  I'll lay down, pretend to sleep for hours with just my thoughts, and sometimes fall asleep for 2-3 hours.  It becomes much harder to sleep when I'm sick.  At the time of this sickness, I was maybe getting 3 one night, 1 hour the next.

In conclusion, if I am sick in just the wrong way at just the wrong time, I'm afraid my own voice echoing in my head along with the sounds around me being off, I may become violently paranoid.",2,1746760515.0,offmychest,4,1.0,False

Theres three people I cannot get a long with in the workplace. One is a coworker named Nancy, One is my boss Bryan, and one is my coworker named Shannon. I will begin with Nancy

Nancy complains a lot about me and other coworkers and I mean a lot. She hardly works and stands behind people bossing them despite just being a coworker and not in a position of authority. She hates talking and wants everything quiet all the time. She overloads work onto others especially my coworker Fran. She overloaded Fran and I with tons of laundry. I had several bins of laundry to fold and Fran had tons of laundry to deliver. She and I were both overwhelmed and she asked for help but sadly I was so overwhelmed that I only helped her at the last minute. The next time I saw Nancy she scolded me in front of everyone and said I was a terrible coworker who hates teamwork because I helped Fran at the last minute. She then told me everyone over the weekend said I talk all the time and need to shut up so I went to the bathroom to cry only to find out later that no one said that. 

I'm going to also list off all her complaints: She demands that I clean the dryer vats once every 2-3 loads, demands that I don't load the dryers at the end of the day or leave them loaded which contradicts with what the boss says and he says the polar opposite, demands I don't roll up the fitted sheets, demands that the largest assisted living clothes go first with the smallest going last, demands  that I only have one earbud in for my music instead of two, favors another coworker over me, demands I speed up, has ignored me multiple times when I have spoken to her, talked crap about me behind my back, demands that only certain tables are for folding and certain ones are for storage, complains that I sip my coffee too much and wants me to put my coffee and stuff in a specific spot, calls me tapping on my phone to change a song or etc as ""playing on my phone instead of working"" and the list of complaints and demands goes on and on and on. She also got into an intense argument with Fran and tried to get me involved. She complains all the time that no one does work but her but it's actually the opposite 

Shannon steals and told the boss that I don't do my work and take excessive breaks constantly which is bullcrap

Bryan gave me a verbal warning and said I was a lazy person who flaunted not wanting to work because I needed a 
bathroom break once after pizza and ice cream cake was being served during lunch, demands I am only allowed to go to the bathroom at certain times for whatever reason and I don't go to the bathroom excessively in fact I only go to the bathroom at least twice during an eight hour shift, gets on my ass for not doing work for like 2 seconds, his demands often contradict with Nancies, he demands that I clock in and out  EXACTLY at the same time because he hates even just one minute of overtime, blames me for not knowing things I haven't been taught, demands I speed up, yells a lot, and brags constantly on Nancy although she barely works.",2,1746759569.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

The role that I agreed to take on in *January* requires a lot of responsibility and preparedness. 

I’m literally one of 4 people responsible for coordinating the first 72 hours of an emergency shelter being set up. The chapter I’m in consists of 11 counties in a state where forest fires aren’t an *IF*, they’re a *WHEN*.

My supervisor has barely spoken to me this entire time. We had one in person meeting and there was a lot of explaining how things work and what we “need to do”. He is an extremely busy person and I understand that. I did email him a couple months ago to ask where we were at because it’s almost fire  season and he’s given me absolutely nothing to do.

It isn’t a matter of me not knowing what we need to do, it’s that there’s no tasks specifically he’s having me do. I will ask questions and he will do his best to answer them but it never ends with him instructing me or even giving me a basic list of things I need to do!

So we did another meeting online this time about 4-6 weeks ago and he gave me a list of 12 volunteers to reach out to. Okay, cool. I did that. I’m not quite sure how that helps us prepare.

I recently got invited to another online meeting with another person with his title but further north of us and someone they found to help in that area. I was expecting this to be an initial meeting with a clear plan and that this other volunteer would be as clueless as I was.

But nope, I was totally blindsided. The other person with my supervisor’s title gave her an entire plan and a spreadsheet to work off of and she had already started what I should have at least 2 months ago. 

Not only that, I kept trying to get answers on what the role actually entails since I’ve felt totally out of the loop. When asked what I had been working on I told them that I called the volunteers like I was asked. Then radio silence.

Once the role was explained a little more clearly they started to say “make it your own” but then any idea I suggested was shot down and IMO it was because they know something I don’t know. 

My direct supervisor doesn’t strike me as someone who is rude or vindictive but definitely doesn’t have great communication and also sucks at delegation. Now I’m left feeling like this is either a personal issue between him and I or something else is amiss. 

How do you deal with supervisors like this?! It’s driving me crazy. The role is very prestigious and I’m more than capable of doing whatever it is that they need me to do. 

I have 1 year of service volunteering there, I have 7 years of administrative experience, 2 years of experience in telecom customer service, and I got my master’s in library and information science in 2017. Not to mention I’ve brought our volunteer base together socially with coffee meetups.

I’m just scared that my reputation is at risk if I’m not being provided with the guidance and tools I need to get going on this. Whatever “this” is!!! Because if something gets fucked up you know I’m the one getting the blame.",2,1746759494.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

I think that overpriced, oversweet drinks are for just for sugar enthusiasts, not coffee/tea enthusiasts. I'm referring to traditional coffee and tea.

Is there actually some truth behind the fact that what you traditionally drink defines your lifestyle?

\- In my opinion, coffee drinkers are those who require fuel for their day. Coffee is their ""go juice"" that gets them through long hours of work or powers them through that big presentation. I think of high energy performers and high-stress environments.

\- Tea drinkers to me always felt like they had their life together, were a little more happy, and took things more slowly like they were savoring their day. They also often came off as more introverted???

\- Additionally, I think those who drink matcha are much more calm, traditional, and minimalistic, and health-conscious. It might just be my impression from the Japanese background, but my friends here in the states also give off that vibe and they love making matcha tea every day.

We rush through our days, often on autopilot, missing the subtle beauty and important details that surround us. Cultivating awareness is about intentionally slowing down, paying attention, and engaging with our senses. It's about noticing the small things – the warmth of the sun on your skin, the sound of birdsong, the taste of your morning coffee.

Awareness extends beyond our immediate surroundings. It involves understanding our own thoughts and emotions, recognizing our biases, and acknowledging the perspectives of others. This deeper self-awareness allows us to make more conscious choices and respond to situations with greater clarity and compassion. By becoming more aware, we can improve our relationships, reduce stress, and live more fulfilling lives. How do you practice awareness in your daily routine?

It’s a collection of Billie Joe Armstrong’s favorite songs—or at least the ones he’s shared, covered, or mentioned over the years. At the time, Billie was my favorite artist, and creating this playlist became a way for me to explore the music that inspired him.

I originally started it during the pandemic, when Billie was doing his No Fun Mondays cover series. Now that was five years ago, and I’ve recently updated the playlist to reflect that milestone. I’ve added some new tracks, including covers from the early 90s to late 2010s that I found through setlist.fm. I also added songs mentioned on [Welcome to My Panic](https://youtu.be/1groDjC6PvU?si=sIG-23BTYY84F4kb) and [20th Anniversary: American Idiot - documentary](https://link.tubi.tv/gycZOgmBdTb) (if you do not want to pay the Peacock subscription it is free on Tubi as well as Heart Like a Hand Grenade). If Billie has posted or covered any new songs recently on his story or other means, feel free to let me know—I haven’t been keeping up as closely with the band and hardly active on social media anymore.

The playlist pulls from various sources:

Old Coverups, Del Gatos, and Upside Downers setlists

Oakland Coffee’s Playlist / Punk Bunny Radio

Livestreams, interviews, and Billie’s Instagram (both professional and Longshot accounts)


Whenever he shared a song, I tried to find the same version on Spotify or YouTube so it would reflect the sound he was hearing. My goal was to build something that fans—or anyone curious—could use to discover new music and dive into Billie’s influences.

Over the past five years, working on this playlist helped me discover so many bands I never would have known otherwise. It gave me a new appreciation for the punk, garage rock, and alternative scenes Billie’s a part of—and how those influences shape his sound.

If this playlist helps you find something new or brings back a memory, I hope you enjoy it as much as I’ve enjoyed making it.

1ki8b4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLettersRaw/comments/1ki8b4m/it_was_real/,IT WAS REAL,"I was chosen. I chose her. I was a good partner.  I gave real love.  I mattered.  We mattered.

What we had wasn’t a fantasy. It wasn’t a dream. It wasn’t just potential. It was lived, embodied, messy, beautiful, and real.

She loved a good grilled cheese and I made a great one. Might have been her favorite. If she was working from home and I was there, I’d bring her lunch - cook for her, make her coffee or go get it, whatever she needed. I loved doing it.

Saturday or Sunday mornings were my favorite. If we weren't lingering in bed, I’d wake up before everyone and walk the dog, feed her, and start breakfast with some gentle classical music just loud enough not to wake anyone. I knew how she liked her eggs - over medium with sprinkled cheese and hot sauce. I kept trying to perfect it.
Breakfast usually included pancakes, bacon, potatoes, avocadoes,  toast, fresh fruit, smoothies - and ALWAYS coffee. It was joy. It was love.

I went to the store at least once a week and stocked that house with care.  Everything her son loved.  Everything she loved. I planned our meals. I cooked for us. I washed the dishes.  Made tea before bed. I made our home feel full. I got her whatever feminine products she needed. I bought beer even when I was concerned about how often she drank - because I cared, and I wanted her to feel supported, not judged.

I helped her move out of her old place. Really helped. Packed, cleaned, hauled, took out all the garbage. She wanted to give up at one point, but I pushed us through. Finished it all myself when she had to work on Monday. Not because I wanted something from her. Because I loved her. Because I believed in what we were building.

I bought a couch, an air purifier, a dryer, a huge TV, matching furniture, mood lighting, mattresses, shoe racks (which were dominated with her shoes), dog gates, dog beds (all of which got chewed), toys, treats, harnesses, a crate, dry and wet food. I built our home, piece by piece and she made her loving and complementary contributions. We made it warm. We made it beautiful. It was ours. Often messy but full of love and life.

I supported her when she decided to start a new career. I encouraged her when she went back to school. I bought her a new computer. I believed in her. In us.

I loved her son. We connected right away - I’m good with kids and I'm a dad's dad through and through. I wasn't a replacement, I was a healthy supplement. It wasn’t always easy. He was wild and demanding. She couldn’t set boundaries. But I stayed the course. I showed up. I loved him.  Even when his father tried to poison the well. 

When he needed a new bed, I bought  one. Hauled out the old mattress. Set up the frame. Did it all happily with care and diligence.

We were a family.

We sang karaoke at home, just the two of us. One night she suggested we sing ""Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now"" it felt like magic. I believed every word. We smiled and kissed and felt unstoppable. I think I even sounded good.

She recorded songs for me. Wrote me loving notes. Sent me sexy videos full of fire and vulnerability. Shared her body with me in sacred, intimate, wild, beautiful ways. I knew her. I listened. I took my time. She let go with me. She trusted me. And I loved every inch of her.

She loved nipple play. I loved her small, beautiful breasts and the way her nipples responded to pressure, teasing, licking, and twisting. She gave herself to me and I honored every bit of it. Her shaking, breathless orgasms meant everything to me. I felt proud, connected, alive.

We made love more times than I can count. I craved her. I didn’t need anything else. I didn’t love her for performance. I loved her for her.

I bought her little gifts just because. I wanted to see her smile. That was enough reason.

When both my parents died she stood next to me. No hesitation. She held me in grief. She was there. And I’ll never forget that.

We went to New Orleans. Did a ghost tour, danced, drank, held hands in the streets. She had a jealousy flareup. I stayed calm and talked her down. Later she suggested going to a strip club! I was unsure, watching her reactions, wanting to avoid triggering her again. But then something happened - as we walked past a stage, some men from a bachelor party looked at her instead of the dancer. Stared her down.  Without thinking, I said loud and proud - “Did you enjoy the show?” I was drunk on love. The men followed us outside, and she feared it would escalate, but I stayed calm, grounded, and steady. Smoothed it over. Protected us. That night, I truly felt what it meant to love like a man.

We stayed out all night even after Bourbon Street went dark. Drank, laughed, kissed, ate. We befriended a homeless man and I bought dinner for him and his dog. My heart was full.

She asked if I wanted to adopt a dog. Of course I said yes. That was us building a life. A family.

When she needed something, anything, I was there. I showed up.

In the end as she was running away I gave her one more gift, extremely personal and significant. A refinement of a symbol of what I thought we were building, what we were meant to be. Her dream that became mine too. A vision of something sacred, eternal, and loving. A seed planted with tenderness and foresight.  I gave it to her with my entire heart in it. With a message of love, hope, belief, and gratitude. The gift was real, as well as the meaning behind it.

And then the end came.

I didn’t flinch. I didn’t walk away. I didn’t give up.

She did.

And maybe she’ll pretend it didn’t matter. Maybe she has rewritten the story. Buried it in dark silence. And somehow she smiles through her shame.

But I know the truth - she’s ashamed. She has to be. Because no one walks away from this kind of love without consequence. You don’t destroy something sacred and stay untouched, unaccountable, unaffected.

Maybe she’ll never say it. Maybe no one else will ever be able to understand. But I do.

Because I was there. I was co-creating it alongside her. I gave everything. And it was real.

She can bury it. Deny it. Rewrite it. But I lived it. I remember.

And I am proud of myself.

I was a good partner.

I gave real authentic love.

I mattered.

I was chosen.

And I chose.

And I will not be silenced. ",1,1746759098.0,UnsentLettersRaw,1,0.67,False

How to Manage Prostate Problems in Kerala — A Friendly Guide for Men’s Health

Let’s be real — most men in Kerala don’t talk about prostate issues until it starts affecting their daily life. Frequent trips to the bathroom? Weak urine stream? Feeling like you can’t empty your bladder completely? These are signs your prostate is asking for attention.

So, [how to manage prostate problems in Kerala](https://sdcprostatecentre.com/how-to-manage-prostate-problems-in-kerala/) without stressing yourself out? Good news: it’s not as complicated as it sounds. This guide will walk you through simple steps — from diet to doctor visits — that can help you stay on top of your prostate health. Plus, we’ll talk about how places like SDC PROSTATE RESEARCH & TRAINING CENTRE in Thrissur are changing the game with advanced care.

Understanding the Prostate: What, Why, and How

The prostate is a walnut-sized gland just below the bladder. It plays a role in semen production. But as men age — especially over 50 — the gland can enlarge, causing a condition called Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). This can lead to troubling urinary symptoms.

Whether you’re dealing with BPH, prostatitis, or early signs of prostate trouble, it’s essential to know how to manage prostate problems in Kerala in a smart, health-conscious way.

Recognizing the Common Symptoms

* Trouble starting urination
* A weak or interrupted flow
* Frequent urge to pee, especially at night
* Pain or burning sensation
* Feeling that the bladder doesn’t empty

How to Manage Prostate Problems in Kerala the Right Way

Here are some proven strategies that men across Kerala can adopt to ease prostate-related symptoms and improve life quality:

🥗 Eat the Right Foods

Managing your prostate starts with your plate. Foods rich in antioxidants, omega-3s, and lycopene can promote better prostate health.

Include:

* Tomatoes (lycopene-rich)
* Green leafy vegetables
* Pumpkin seeds
* Fish like sardines or mackerel
* Zinc-rich foods like cashews

Avoid:

* Spicy foods
* Excess caffeine
* Alcohol
* Processed meat

Want to know how to manage prostate problems in Kerala with food? Stick to a “plant-leaning Kerala-style diet” with lots of vegetables, fish, and local superfoods.

🚶 Stay Physically Active

Daily walks, yoga, or even light cycling can improve bladder control and overall prostate function. Just 30 minutes a day helps. Plus, staying active also helps manage weight — a key factor in prostate health.

🧘 Control Stress

Prostate symptoms can get worse when you’re stressed. Techniques like meditation, deep breathing, or even taking short breaks during the day help ease your body and your bladder.

💧 Smart Fluid Management

Drink plenty of water, but reduce intake after 7 PM. Curb the urge to drink tea or coffee in the evenings — they act as diuretics.

🏋️‍♂️ Try Kegels (Yes, Men Too!)

Strengthening the pelvic floor muscles improves urinary control. These exercises are discreet and effective. Perfect for managing symptoms of BPH.

When to Seek Medical Help

Sometimes, despite doing everything right, the symptoms persist. That’s when you need to consult a urologist.

If you’re wondering how to manage prostate problems in Kerala medically, the best option is to visit a reputed center like SDC PROSTATE RESEARCH & TRAINING CENTRE, Thrissur.

Breakfast usually included pancakes, bacon, potatoes, avocadoes,  toast, fresh fruit, smoothies - and ALWAYS coffee. It was joy. It was love.

I went to the store at least once a week and stocked that house with care.  Everything her son loved.  Everything she loved. I planned our meals. I cooked for us. I washed the dishes.  Made tea before bed. I made our home feel full. I got her whatever feminine products she needed. I bought beer even when I was concerned about how often she drank - because I cared, and I wanted her to feel supported, not judged.

I helped her move out of her old place. Really helped. Packed, cleaned, hauled, took out all the garbage. She wanted to give up at one point, but I pushed us through. Finished it all myself when she had to work on Monday. Not because I wanted something from her. Because I loved her. Because I believed in what we were building.

I bought a couch, an air purifier, a dryer, a huge TV, matching furniture, mood lighting, mattresses, shoe racks (which were dominated with her shoes), dog gates, dog beds (all of which got chewed), toys, treats, harnesses, a crate, dry and wet food. I built our home, piece by piece and she made her loving and complementary contributions. We made it warm. We made it beautiful. It was ours. Often messy but full of love and life.

I supported her when she decided to start a new career. I encouraged her when she went back to school. I bought her a new computer. I believed in her. In us.

I loved her son. We connected right away - I’m good with kids and I'm a dad's dad through and through. I wasn't a replacement, I was a healthy supplement. It wasn’t always easy. He was wild and demanding. She couldn’t set boundaries. But I stayed the course. I showed up. I loved him.  Even when his father tried to poison the well. 

When he needed a new bed, I bought  one. Hauled out the old mattress. Set up the frame. Did it all happily with care and diligence.

We were a family.

We sang karaoke at home, just the two of us. One night she suggested we sing ""Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now"" it felt like magic. I believed every word. We smiled and kissed and felt unstoppable. I think I even sounded good.

She recorded songs for me. Wrote me loving notes. Sent me sexy videos full of fire and vulnerability. Shared her body with me in sacred, intimate, wild, beautiful ways. I knew her. I listened. I took my time. She let go with me. She trusted me. And I loved every inch of her.

She loved nipple play. I loved her small, beautiful breasts and the way her nipples responded to pressure, teasing, licking, and twisting. She gave herself to me and I honored every bit of it. Her shaking, breathless orgasms meant everything to me. I felt proud, connected, alive.

We made love more times than I can count. I craved her. I didn’t need anything else. I didn’t love her for performance. I loved her for her.

I bought her little gifts just because. I wanted to see her smile. That was enough reason.

When both my parents died she stood next to me. No hesitation. She held me in grief. She was there. And I’ll never forget that.

We went to New Orleans. Did a ghost tour, danced, drank, held hands in the streets. She had a jealousy flareup. I stayed calm and talked her down. Later she suggested going to a strip club! I was unsure, watching her reactions, wanting to avoid triggering her again. But then something happened - as we walked past a stage, some men from a bachelor party looked at her instead of the dancer. Stared her down.  Without thinking, I said loud and proud - “Did you enjoy the show?” I was drunk on love. The men followed us outside, and she feared it would escalate, but I stayed calm, grounded, and steady. Smoothed it over. Protected us. That night, I truly felt what it meant to love like a man.

We stayed out all night even after Bourbon Street went dark. Drank, laughed, kissed, ate. We befriended a homeless man and I bought dinner for him and his dog. My heart was full.

She asked if I wanted to adopt a dog. Of course I said yes. That was us building a life. A family.

When she needed something, anything, I was there. I showed up.

In the end as she was running away I gave her one more gift, extremely personal and significant. A refinement of a symbol of what I thought we were building, what we were meant to be. Her dream that became mine too. A vision of something sacred, eternal, and loving. A seed planted with tenderness and foresight.  I gave it to her with my entire heart in it. With a message of love, hope, belief, and gratitude. The gift was real, as well as the meaning behind it.

And then the end came.

I didn’t flinch. I didn’t walk away. I didn’t give up.

She did.

And maybe she’ll pretend it didn’t matter. Maybe she has rewritten the story. Buried it in dark silence. And somehow she smiles through her shame.

But I know the truth - she’s ashamed. She has to be. Because no one walks away from this kind of love without consequence. You don’t destroy something sacred and stay untouched, unaccountable, unaffected.

Maybe she’ll never say it. Maybe no one else will ever be able to understand. But I do.

Because I was there. I was co-creating it alongside her. I gave everything. And it was real.

She can bury it. Deny it. Rewrite it. But I lived it. I remember.

And I am proud of myself.

I was a good partner.

I gave real authentic love.

I mattered.

I was chosen.

And I chose.

And I will not be silenced. ",3,1746758997.0,unsentLoveLetters1st,0,1.0,False

Again: we get involved two months before launch. 

I started attending meetings, taking notes, developing what I could. All the while, the PM kept saying, ""We are two months away from launch."" August became September, which became October. Program manager changed. Still, every week, the new PM kept saying we were two months from launch. Fast forward to October 23: another new PM and we're still two months away. October 24: still two months away.  Every engineer originally involved has left the company or handed the program off to someone else. I'm now the longest serving member of the project team.

Bartholomew ""Barty"" Buttercup was, by all accounts, an unremarkable man. He had a job in accounts (the irony wasn't lost on him, though he rarely mentioned it), a slightly lopsided houseplant he'd named Susan (after an ex who also leaned a bit), and a digestive system that could charitably be described as… expressive.

The fateful Tuesday began like any other. Barty had consumed his usual breakfast: a bowl of ""Fiber Fiesta"" cereal (the box promised a party in his colon, a promise it always kept with gusto) and a lukewarm cup of instant coffee that tasted vaguely of burnt toast and regret. The morning commute was a symphony of honking horns and Barty's own internal rumbles, a percussive prelude to the day's main event.

It happened at precisely 11:03 AM.

Barty was hunched over his ergonomic keyboard, wrestling with a spreadsheet that seemed to have a personal vendetta against him. He'd been holding it in, a familiar pressure building, a gaseous grumbling that had been his constant companion since the Fiber Fiesta. He’d tried shifting in his chair, clenching, even humming the national anthem under his breath (a trick his grandma swore by, though its efficacy was dubious).

But this one… this one was different. It wasn't just a casual toot, a fleeting whisper of wind. This was the Moby Dick of farts, the Big Kahuna, the one you tell your grandkids about, assuming your grandkids aren't too horrified to listen.

He felt it coming like a runaway freight train, a seismic event brewing in his lower intestine. There was no stopping it. He squeezed his eyes shut, braced his hands on his desk, and surrendered.

The sound that ripped from him was… monumental. It wasn't a sharp crack, nor a bubbly squeak. It was a deep, resonant, baritone BROOOOOOOM that seemed to vibrate the very fillings in his teeth. The office, a typically bustling hive of keyboard clicks and hushed phone calls, fell silent. Utterly, completely silent.

Barty’s face burned hotter than a thousand suns. He dared to crack an eye open. Brenda from HR, a woman whose face was perpetually set in an expression of mild disapproval, was staring at him, her mouth agape, a half-eaten custard cream frozen halfway to her lips. Kevin from IT, who usually communicated only in grunts and binary code, had actually swiveled his chair around, his eyes wide with something akin to awe, or possibly terror. Even Mr. Grumbles, the perpetually grumpy office manager whose office door was always closed, had poked his head out, his comb-over slightly askew.

Time seemed to stretch, each second a tiny, agonizing eternity. Barty wanted the earth to open up and swallow him whole, or at least for his ergonomic chair to develop a sudden, powerful ejector seat.

Then, the smell hit.

It was… indescribable. Imagine, if you will, the unholy union of a forgotten gym sock, a family of badgers who’d taken up competitive cheese-eating, and the lingering aroma of a science experiment gone terribly, terribly wrong. It was a smell that didn't just offend the nostrils; it assaulted them, took them hostage, and then performed unspeakable acts upon their delicate sensibilities.

Brenda made a small, choked sound and fumbled for her emergency can of air freshener, the one labeled ""Ocean Breeze"" which, in this context, felt like a cruel, ironic joke. Kevin actually gagged. Mr. Grumbles slammed his door shut with a force that rattled the motivational posters on the wall.

Barty, meanwhile, was trying to become one with his chair. He wished he could retract his head into his torso like a terrified turtle. ""Excuse me,"" he mumbled, his voice a strangled whisper.

But it wasn't over. Oh no, it was just beginning.

As the initial shockwave of the scent began to (theoretically) dissipate – though ""mutate"" might have been a more accurate term – something strange happened. The fluorescent lights above Barty's desk flickered. Once, twice, then went out completely, plunging his little cubicle into semi-darkness.

""Great,"" Barty muttered, ""Now I've broken the lights.""

He jiggled the switch. Nothing. He was about to call for Kevin, who despite his current state of olfactory shock was usually good with these things, when he noticed it.

The air around his desk, where the epicenter of the… event… had been, seemed… thicker. The potent aroma hadn't just lingered; it seemed to be congealing. Patches of the air shimmered, like heat haze on asphalt, but with a sickly, greenish-brown tint. The light from the hallway seemed to bend and warp as it passed through these patches.

Barty stared, his earlier embarrassment momentarily forgotten, replaced by a creeping, icy tendril of unease. ""What in the…""

The shimmering patches began to coalesce, drawing together like malevolent droplets of oil on water. The smell intensified again, but now it carried a new note, something acrid and almost… hungry. Slowly, a visible form began to take shape in the dim light of his cubicle. It was roughly spherical, about the size of a beach ball, and it pulsed with a faint, internal luminescence that was a nauseating blend of swamp gas and old cheese. It was, unmistakably, the fart. His fart. And it was looking at him. Or at least, it gave that distinct impression.

A low, guttural gurgle emanated from the cloud, a sound like air escaping a long-sealed tomb, or perhaps just very, very bad indigestion amplified a thousand times. It bobbed in the air, then drifted slowly, purposefully, out of his cubicle and into the main office area.

Brenda, who had just managed to take a shaky sip of water, saw it first. Her eyes widened, her face turned a shade paler than her custard cream, and she let out a shriek that could curdle milk. The cloud, Barty's monstrous, sentient fart-cloud, seemed to quiver at the sound, almost like it was pleased.

It then drifted towards Kevin's workstation. Kevin, still looking a bit green around the gills, was trying to reboot his computer. The cloud enveloped his monitor, and the screen instantly fizzled, emitting a shower of sparks before going completely black. Kevin yelped and scrambled back, tripping over his chair.

The cloud let out another wet, gurgling sound, which Barty was beginning to interpret as a chuckle.

His life, Barty suddenly realized with a chilling certainty that had nothing to do with residual flatulence, would never, ever be the same. And as his airborne abomination began to slowly drift towards Mr. Grumbles' closed door, pulsing with noxious intent, Barty had a sinking feeling that ""different"" was going to involve a lot more than just office apologies. This wasn't just a bad smell; it was a bad omen, a gaseous demon he'd unwittingly unleashed upon his unsuspecting colleagues.



Chapter 2: The Brown Note



The sentient fart cloud, which Barty was starting to think of as ""The Aftermath,"" didn't bother with the niceties of knocking. It simply seeped under Mr. Grumbles' office door, a noxious tendril of greenish-brown vapor leading the charge. A moment later, a muffled yelp echoed from within, followed by a series of increasingly frantic thumps and a sound like a walrus gargling gravel.

Barty, Brenda, and Kevin exchanged horrified glances. Brenda was clutching her ""Ocean Breeze"" can like a holy relic, though its power seemed woefully inadequate against this particular brand of evil. Kevin, ever the pragmatist, was already halfway under his desk, muttering about network protocols and the sudden, inexplicable urge to invest in a gas mask.

Then, from Mr. Grumbles' office, came a new sound. It was a low, continuous rumble, like a distant thunderstorm, but somehow… wetter. The rumble grew in intensity, punctuated by strained groans and the distinct creak of an office chair under immense pressure.

""What's it doing to him?"" Brenda whispered, her voice trembling.

Barty didn't want to know. He really, really didn't. But a morbid curiosity, mixed with a dawning sense of responsibility (it was his fart, after all), kept him rooted to the spot.

The rumbling reached a crescendo, a truly earth-shattering (or perhaps trouser-shattering) roar that made the previous BROOOOOOOM sound like a polite cough. It was followed by a series of smaller, sputtering pops, then a long, drawn-out, deflating hiss. And then… silence. A heavy, ominous silence that was somehow worse than the cacophony that had preceded it.

The Aftermath oozed back out from under Mr. Grumbles' door. It seemed… larger. And somehow, smugger. It pulsed with a triumphant, sickly green light, and the gurgling sound it emitted now had a distinctly satisfied, almost purring quality.

It drifted slowly towards Brenda.

""No,"" she whimpered, backing away, spraying a desperate cloud of Ocean Breeze in its path. The Aftermath seemed to inhale the floral scent, and for a terrifying moment, Barty thought it might actually smile. Or whatever the gaseous equivalent of a smile was. Instead, it let out a sound like a wet balloon animal being twisted into an obscene shape, and the Ocean Breeze scent was instantly overpowered by its own signature stench, now somehow even more potent.

Brenda stumbled, her eyes wide with terror. The Aftermath enveloped her.

What happened next was both horrifying and deeply, deeply undignified. Brenda, a woman who prided herself on her composure and her meticulously organized spice rack, began to… well, she began to fart. Not just one or two, but a continuous, unrelenting barrage, each one more violent and explosive than the last. Her face contorted, first in shock, then in agony, then in a strange, gassy ecstasy. She clutched her stomach, her body convulsing with each internal detonation. The air around her thickened with a new, uniquely Brenda-esque aroma that mingled tragically with The Aftermath's own foulness.

""It's… it's making her…"" Kevin stammered from under his desk, his voice muffled.

""Fart herself to death?"" Barty finished, his own stomach churning. It was absurd. It was grotesque. It was also, undeniably, happening.

Brenda's eyes rolled back in her head. A final, monumental eruption escaped her, a sound that seemed to shake the very foundations of the building, and then she collapsed, a faint plume of her own making rising from her still form. The Aftermath pulsed again, absorbing the essence of Brenda's final, fatal flatulence, growing slightly larger, its greenish hue deepening.

It turned its attention to Kevin's desk.

""No, no, no, no!"" Kevin shrieked, scrambling further under his desk, which offered about as much protection as a paper umbrella in a hurricane. ""I'm just IT! I fix things! I don't… I don't do this!""

The Aftermath, however, was not interested in his job description. It seeped around the desk, its tendrils exploring, seeking. Barty knew he had to do something. This was his creation, his monstrous, gaseous offspring. He couldn't just stand by and watch it decimate the entire accounts department.

But what could he do? You couldn't punch a fart. You couldn't reason with it. Could you… apologize to it?

""Look,"" Barty began, his voice surprisingly steady, ""I'm… I'm sorry. That was me. My fault. Fiber Fiesta, you know? Maybe we can talk about this?""

The Aftermath paused in its pursuit of Kevin. It swiveled its bulk (if a cloud can be said to have bulk) towards Barty. It emitted a low, questioning gurgle.

Barty took a hesitant step forward. ""You don't have to do this. They're innocent! Well, mostly innocent. Mr. Grumbles did steal my stapler once, but…""

The Aftermath let out an impatient, bubbling hiss. It clearly wasn't interested in office politics or petty theft. It wanted… something else. And as it began to drift towards Barty, its sickly green light pulsing with a predatory hunger, Barty had a terrible, sinking feeling he knew exactly what that was. It had come from him. And it seemed determined to make everyone else experience the same explosive fate.

His life, he thought with a fresh wave of horror, was not only never going to be the same, it might also be very, very short.



Chapter 3: The Cycle



The Aftermath loomed, a pulsating sphere of noxious intent, its sickly green light casting an unnatural pallor on Barty's already pale face. It had consumed the essence of Mr. Grumbles and Brenda, growing stronger, more potent, its low gurgle now carrying a distinct, almost musical quality that was deeply unsettling. Kevin remained frozen under his desk, a muffled whimper occasionally escaping his hiding spot.

""Okay, look,"" Barty said again, backing away slowly, his hands held up defensively. ""This is… unexpected. For both of us, I assume? I mean, I didn't plan this. It just… happened. Spicy Fiber Fiesta, maybe? They added ghost peppers this season, I think.""

The Aftermath didn't respond with words, but its gurgling intensified, sounding less like a chuckle and more like a hungry growl. It drifted closer, the air around Barty becoming thick and cloying, filled with the concentrated aroma of his own digestive failure, now amplified to cosmic proportions.

He could feel it now, a strange resonance. It was like standing too close to a powerful speaker, the bass vibrating in his chest, but this vibration was deeper, centered in his gut, a mirror image of the rumbling he’d felt moments before the ""Big One.""

The cloud reached him, enveloping him in its foul embrace. Barty squeezed his eyes shut, bracing himself for the inevitable, explosive, undignified end that had befallen Brenda and, presumably, Mr. Grumbles. He waited for the internal detonations, the uncontrollable release, the final, fatal fart.

But it didn't come.

Instead, the cloud seemed to… settle around him. The intense smell remained, overwhelming his senses, but it didn't trigger the violent expulsion he expected. It was more like being submerged in warm, incredibly putrid bathwater.

Then, the vibration intensified. It wasn't just in his chest now; it was everywhere, coursing through his veins, his bones, the very core of his being. It felt like his internal organs were being gently but firmly massaged by a thousand tiny, gassy hands.

And then, he felt it. A faint, almost imperceptible tugging sensation. It was coming from the cloud, and it was directed inward, towards him.

It was trying to pull him in.

Not physically, not like a vacuum, but something deeper, more fundamental. It was like his own essence, his very being, was being drawn out, absorbed into the gaseous form that had originated within him.

Panic flared, hot and sharp, cutting through the thick fog of the smell. He thrashed instinctively, trying to push the cloud away, but his hands passed through it as if it were just smoke, albeit incredibly foul-smelling smoke.

The tugging grew stronger. He could feel his energy draining, his thoughts becoming sluggish. Images flickered in his mind – the Fiber Fiesta box, Susan the lopsided plant, the spreadsheet that had started it all, Brenda's horrified face, Kevin's panicked scramble. Fragments of his unremarkable life, being pulled away.

A new sensation bloomed in his gut, not the painful pressure that preceded the Big One, but a strange, empty ache, like a void was forming inside him. The Aftermath pulsed with a brighter, more vibrant green light, its gurgling taking on a triumphant, almost joyous tone.

Barty realized, with a sickening certainty, what was happening. His creation wasn't just killing others with flatulence; it was consuming their essence, adding their gassy remains to its own mass. And now, it was returning to its source, not to destroy him, but to reintegrate. To absorb the very person from whom it had sprung.

He was being reabsorbed by his own fart.

The thought was so utterly bizarre, so profoundly humiliating, that it almost overshadowed the terror. He, Bartholomew ""Barty"" Buttercup, was being assimilated by an airborne abomination of his own making. His legacy wouldn't be his accounts work or his slightly sad houseplant, but this… this monstrous cloud of digestive byproduct.

His vision began to dim, the office around him fading into a swirling vortex of greenish-brown. The gurgling sound seemed to fill his head, echoing in the newfound emptiness within him. He could feel himself shrinking, his form dissolving, becoming one with the pungent cloud.

His last coherent thought, before his consciousness dissolved entirely into the collective gaseous consciousness of The Aftermath, was a faint, resigned sigh.

Kevin, still cowering under his desk, finally dared to peek out. The large, pulsating green cloud hovered where Barty had stood moments before. It seemed different now, larger, its light more intense, its gurgling sound a complex symphony of past meals and departed souls. It slowly drifted away from Barty's empty chair, towards the next cubicle, towards the unsuspecting occupants of the floor above, ready to continue its cycle of absorption and expansion.

Bartholomew Buttercup was gone. Only The Aftermath remained, a monument to a truly epic case of indigestion and the unexpected, terrifying consequences of a Fiber Fiesta gone wrong. The age of Barty was over. The age of The Aftermath had just begun.",1,1746758583.0,scarystories,1,0.67,False

My wife left me at the end of January (obviously not the exciting part), and most of my furniture conveniently left me with her. Basically, I was left with the bedroom set. That's it. But I have a daughter who lives with her mother primarily, and she needed some semblance of a normal home, so I had to buy some furniture. To be fair, I bought a TV at Walmart and a couch, love seat, and full size bedroom set for her from a local furniture store, but that still left a lot of gaps to fill. Especially after I agreed to split the rent with a friend who also needed bedroom furniture for her daughters.

HOWEVER, thanks to Temu shopping, this house is about to be a home again. In the past few weeks, we've ordered a full size mattress for my daughter, two twin size beds AND mattresses for her daughters, a dresser for her girls, and an entertainment center with matching lift-top coffee table, and our total combined out-of-pocket cost is only $559.40.

Once things arrive, my house will start to feel normal for the first time in months, and I'm also getting the opportunity to help a friend get on her feet and provide a normal life for her girls.

I’m planning to start a bike shop that’s more than just a retail space — I want it to be a hub for the cycling community. Think: bike shop + coffee shop + chill spot for riders to hang out, get repairs, and connect.

* What’s your opinion on the current bike scene and market?  
* How would you feel about a café-style bike shop — would you hang out there?  
* What do you feel is missing in today’s bike shops or bike communities?  
* If you could design your ideal local bike shop, what would it have?
* What brands, gear, or services do you wish more local shops offered?  
* And where (city or neighborhood) would you love to see something like this pop up?

What this means is you never want to pay attention to anything people are saying about something (yes I know this is kind of contradictory to this whole post but stay with me here). Even if someone says that Kendu is cooked or whatever, just do your own research and come to your own conclusions.

With a community as hard working as Kendu you cannot rule us out. Stay with me now. We have been on a downtrend for a while now (which we've just broken out of today, see: [legendary comeback on the charts](https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/1khjdkl/kendu_just_brokeout_nothing_is_stopping_this_now/)) but the Chad's in the tg are nonstop grinding every day and night to ensure that we make it. You can't listen to the FUD, it's simply going to cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars - if not millions. Right now is clearly a generational entry into Kendu, it is so clearly undervalued that it is genuinely laughable. The reversal is so imminent you have to be stupid to think otherwise. Sure, the coin might fall to a little lower from this point, but it also might've found its bottom and shoot straight back up to 50-100 milly, which is probably what is going to happen from here seeing the massive reversal in the wider market today.

Either way, now is the time to get involved. Drown out the FUD that you hear. Imagine if early Shib holders listened to the FUD when their coin went down 95% (they all would later be millionaires from holding, I know a few personally who were in Shib in the early days and heard a lot of stories from people who have lost their minds... They are not pretty). Imagine if the early Pepe holders listened to the image attached to this post. They would have also lost out on their generational entry and wealth. Keep your head in the game and give yourself a reality check. Money will NEVER come easy and listening to the FUD is why 99% of DeFi investors (degens) have a negative PnL with no hopes of turning it green.

Look at the past Shiba Inu profit chart from release to ATH's:

And what is KENDU you may ask? Well let me explain...

The project has changed the lives of many thousands of community members.

A Kendu (can-do) attitude has made countless people get up off the couch, out of retirement, and out on the streets building under the brand umbrella.

The Kendu community has built:

\- A Kendu Games Studio with ex-Bioware and AAA game devs  
\- Kendu beers  
\- A Kendu board game  
\- Kendu energy drinks  
\- Kendu events company in India  
\- Kendu events presence USA  
\- Kendu sports brand (You Kendu It)  
\- Kendu eSports team  
\- Kendu coffee brand  
\- Kendu sweets, chocolates, and spirits  
\- Much more in the works

Kendu has brought crypto to life, and life to those in crypto. It's an exceptional project the likes of which doesn't exist and hasn't been attempted.

Imagine a permissionless brand behemoth that anyone can build under, immediately tapping into a scaling CaaS (Community-as-a-service), where the treasury is voluntarily, not contractually, is replenished by those building businesses under Kendu, and that treasury is transparently used for grants for products, businesses, or initiatives the community wants to build with Kendu. Almost akin to an L1.

And of course kendu is still a memecoin so everything relates back to the Kendu dog on the coin for those wondering. I believe Kendu will become the industry standard, forcing future coins to start innovating rather than trying the same structure of the typical coin we see today: create some bland narrative, start getting KOLs to call it (mad apes, pow etc... people who only want supply) and then proceed to run the coin for a week before leaving it.

You can Kendufy anything. And everything will be Kendufied.

I said they must have gotten rid of it and you joked, “Not without checking with us first”. I laughed and might have stuttered a bit realizing we have the same humor.

Later you popped your head from the next aisle and let me know about the powdered Tide, which caught me off guard in the best way. We chatted over powdered detergent some more while perching over pallets of dog food. 

You had no cart, just carrying a giant bag. (A major flex for Costco) Blue hoodie, baseball cap, tallish. I was with a friend who saw it all happen and caught me doing a giddy dance as you walked away.

I wished we ran into each other one more time. If you happen to read this, I think you’re cute and would love to grab a coffee or a Costco hotdog sometime 😅

How do you guys do it? 

After going through a tough breakup last year, last month I decided that I'm feeling good and ready to try dating again. I started getting matches and talking to some great women, but slowly the unmatching and the ghosting started. I then matched with someone and we really hit it off, we spoke for a few weeks, and then met for a coffee date - it went amazing, I felt extremely happy- especially when she told me that she felt the same way. We continued to chat though text for a few days, but then it started to fade. The 24 hour responses, the lack of effort in her responses. I asked if she'd like to attend an event with me next week, but she said she was busy, and didn't offer any alternative plan. So I'm assuming that's the end of that. I'm now feeling similar to how I felt during the breakup - lost and mentally exhausted (but not as bad as the breakup). 

Why's it so hard to find someone who wants the same thing as me? A simple, loving, long-term relationship, where we can share our lives. Why do people play games rather than being truthful? It's all so tiring. ",3,1746757267.0,RelationshipIndia,6,1.0,False

Well, I'm 31 weeks now and I came across [this study](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2797983) showing consuming even small amounts (50mg) is associated with lower birth weight and shorter stature in early childhood.

If the official recommendations haven't changed I still feel pretty reassured but wth?? Did anyone's doctor mention anything about it being best not to have any caffeine?
