1mc3zg1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mc3zg1,[Homemade]  No knead bread for breakfast. Simple food but delicious.,"Such a simple recipe that produces lovely bread for breakfast.  Just mix the ingredients together and leave overnight.  Nice cup of coffee, butter and homemade plum How to make No-Knead Dough

Should be done on a Dutch oven at home. We just happened to be on a campsite. 

Recipe is from our best bites. Check out the details there. 

“So let me show you in just a few steps how we’re making this bread.  It starts with all purpose flour, warm water and yeast.  Okay and a little salt, so I guess technically 4 ingredients.

I do want to say something about the flour, here.  I think this recipe does count on people over measuring their flour.  When I actual weigh my flour to get an exact weight for the 3 cups, this dough is extremely wet and loose.  Like, I can’t form it into a ball, it’s more of a thick liquid.  And the bread turns out amazing and soft and beautiful.  When I scoop my flour with the measuring cup (something we are constantly telling you not to do,) the dough is still on the wet-sticky side, but it looks more like most people’s photos of this dough, and you can actually form it into a  ball. And it turns out delicious.  So what I’m saying is, this dough is extremely flexible.  Try it a few times and see what you like, but don’t ever get worried it’s not going to work because it always works!  Just don’t add tons more flour because you think it should be the consistency of playdough.  Because it shouldn’t.  Overall your dough should be quite loose and sticky, but feel free to just dunk your measuring cup in your flour bag and haphazardly scoop.  This is one instance where that totally Let the Dough Rest

Once that’s all mixed up, just cover with plastic, leave on your counter, and come back and visit it tomorrow. It needs to sit for anywhere from 8-18 hours.  I always just mix up the dough the day before, but technically you could do it early in the morning and have it for dinner as well.  Just know the longer it sits, the better the texture will be so I recommend at least 12 At this point you’ll just scrape it all out onto a generously floured surface- I put it directly onto a piece of parchment paper. Remember your dough will be REALLY sticky so sprinkle flour all over it where you’ll be touching it and handle it gently so it doesn’t get all over you.  Fold it on top of itself a couple times (remember no kneading) and form it into a round-ish shape.  Let it sit for 30 minutes.  During that 30 minutes you will place your empty, covered dutch oven in your oven preheated to a screaming hot 450 degrees.  We’re creating our own little bread oven Baking No-Knead Bread

When it’s preheated you will CAREFULLY (can’t stress that enough) remove your crazy hot pan from the oven, transfer your bread into it, and place the lid on.  DON’T FORGET YOUR LID IS PIPING HOT.  I always keep a towel over the handle while it’s on my counter just to be safe.  Pop that pot back into the oven to bake.  You can see I just lift my whole parchment paper that my bread was sitting on and put it into the pot. about 40 minutes later your house will smell like a straight-up European 

This bread has a super crispy crust and a chewy soft inside. It’s the kind of bread you rip off in chunks and slather with butter while it’s still warm, or dunk in a bowl of soup, or dip in olive oil.  It’s amazing.”

This is really worth a try. You won’t be disappointed.

I highlight independent, I don't mean Starbucks, Subway, McDonalds.

The four cases: A medium-sized Turkish actual-Arab food with Turkish/Syrian managers, a very small pancake shop managed by Russians, a small  coffee/wine shop attended by a some EU person, and a noddles shop managed by a Korean . Almost all cases seen in Harbin.

Then there is these huge western-like food, with the same always westernish food hamburger-pizza-pasta-bbq-cake that is actually pretty bad, pre-made, unhealthy and staffed only by local citizens. The cuisine is always the same, repeated in every one of these restaurants regardless of the city.

Why would be so difficult for independent foreign business to open some kind of own type of food.

In my country, we have chinese fried rice, turkish syrian falafel, indian roti, spanish paella, peruvian seviche, etc, etc from large chains, all the way to small with two tables and four chairs. From those with APP and delivery system to those where the owner is also the cashier.

Why in china is so restrictive?

I suppose Chinese folks are not used to foreign taste? But they dont get bored of the same cusine always? how in my country foreign restaurants are so successful and loved, yet WE DON'T have that many foreigners, in fact the clients are mostly locals.",0,1753769728.0,chinalife,2,0.5,False

Let’s Talk Mind-Blowing Wins, Hidden Tools, & the Future of AI-Powered Teams! ✨","Alright, r/GPTAppsEngine friends, I’ll kick us off: Is anyone else absolutely buzzing about BUSINESS AUTOMATION right now? 🚀✨

Honestly, it feels like we’re living on the edge of a revolution, and *we* get to be the early adopters! Whether you’re a developer exploring the latest APIs, a startup budgeting for workflow tools, or just a curious problem-solver, there’s so much happening in this space. Let’s talk about it!

**Why does it feel so _exciting_?**

- Automations are freeing us from the “ugh” tasks and unlocking creative energy for what really matters.
- Companies of every size (including your side hustle!) can set up digital helpers that run 24/7 without coffee breaks.
- The tools are becoming so accessible. You don’t have to be a coding wizard; even no-code fans can play along.

I mean, think about the potential:

- Better customer service—chatbots never sleep 🦾
- Smoother onboarding—welcome emails, account setups, and training, all with zero human micromanagement!
- Invoices sent the second a deal closes. No more, “Oops, forgot to hit send,” moments.

Even better, automation doesn’t mean robots invading your office and taking over (well, unless you work in a robotics lab… then maybe? 🤖). It’s more about people getting to focus on what lights them up! We can:

- Tinker with new product ideas, not just grind through data entry.
- Spend our workdays on learning, mentoring, and growing instead of babysitting spreadsheets.

Don’t you love walking into work and realizing a bunch of yesterday’s tasks have *already* been handled? That feeling when Slack pings and it’s good news cause Zapier already did the mundane stuff for you? Pure joy!

But I’m also (genuinely) excited for what’s *next*. Imagine AI not just automating rules—but helping us reinvent processes, suggesting tweaks *on the fly*, based on patterns it discovers in real time. Smarter, friendlier, and always getting better.

Here’s why I’d love your thoughts:

- What’s the happiest “aha moment” business automation has given you? Any fun, unexpected wins?
- Do you worry that automations can make things too impersonal, or do you see it as a chance to actually strengthen connection?
- Are there automation apps or tools you love but feel are underhyped? Let’s make some noise for the hidden gems!
- Where would you take automation if there were ZERO limits?

Business automation is the stuff that lets an idea fly, scale, and, importantly—*keep its human spark*. And I couldn’t be more thrilled to be part of the crowd building these engines.  

Let’s light up this thread with stories, questions, experiments—happy automating, everyone! 🚀",1,1753769443.0,GPTAppsEngine,0,1.0,False

I don't know why I'm writing this except that I can't keep living this lie and I have nowhere else to turn.

Three weeks ago I got fired from my job at an insurance company. It wasn't for anything dramatic - basically I'd been struggling with depression and my performance had been slipping. I was missing deadlines, making mistakes, calling in sick too much. My manager gave me a warning in February but I couldn't seem to get it together.

The day they let me go, I came home and just... couldn't bring myself to tell my wife Sarah. She was excited about the vacation we'd been planning and stressed about her own job, and I just couldn't add this to her plate.

So I lied. I said everything was fine.

For three weeks now I've been getting up every morning, putting on my work clothes, and leaving the house like I'm going to the office. Instead I sit in coffee shops, walk around the mall, or just drive around town. I come home at my normal time and pretend I had a regular day.

I've been applying for jobs on my phone but the market is terrible right now. I'm burning through our savings to keep up with my usual contributions to household expenses. Sarah has no idea.

The worst part is how easy the lying has become. She asks about my day and I make up meetings and conversations. I even complained about my ""coworker"" Dave last week when she asked why I seemed stressed.

I know this is insane. I know I need to tell her. But every day it gets harder because now it's not just ""I lost my job"" it's ""I lost my job and have been lying to you for weeks.""

I’m picking up what I think are flirty signals, but I’m unsure if she’s just being friendly. Here’s the context:

We work at a pizza place, and Jazz is super smiley when we talk, but she can’t look me in the eye. For example, one day I went on break and walked up to her to ask if she liked coffee (it was like 11 AM, and I was gonna go get some). She was very smiley but wouldn’t look up at me—she said no, looked at me briefly, then bent over the counter looking down, I think messing with a pen, while we kept talking. It felt like she was flustered or shy. I’ve noticed she makes eye contact with other coworkers, so it’s different with me. I can relate because I’m shy sometimes and struggle with eye contact too, so that by its self i wouldent think twice about. The next thing is making me question everything though.

Jazz was doing dishes and took off her ring to keep it safe. I held out my hand, and instead of just putting it in my palm, she grabbed my hand and put the ring on my pinkie herself, saying, “Don’t lose it,” before walking back to dishes. I was so focused on my hand and making sure the ring was safe that I didn’t see her face, so I don’t know if she was smiling, blushing, or what. I’m kicking myself for not noticing her expression, but it felt flirty because she could’ve just handed it to me or given it to another coworker she trusts

We’ve been connecting a lot outside work too. A couple of days ago, Jazz gave me her phone number so she could call me when she got off work, and I could give her a ride home. That night, she called to check if I made it home safely, and we ended up talking for a bit. We talked about how she prefers Burger King over any other burger place which i made fun of her for she than made fun of me for liking hi-c😔. Yesterday, while texting her at work, I was joking about how the cut table is the most fun station and how I was having a blast. About 30 minutes into my break, she called me while I was driving and said, “Are you driving? Call me when you get back to the restaurant, I just wanted to say hi.” I thought that was super cute. We ended up talking for about 15 minutes before I went back to work. We talked about our coworker Nate being a weirdo and always asking about me. She also said I wasn’t shy, then immediately backtracked and said, “Well, no, you are shy, but not as much anymore.” She admitted it took her a while to talk to me because I used to just nod when she’d ask me stuff, like if I was tired. She said she thought i was deaf and that she'd have to learn sign language to talk to me. which i thought was really sweet but i did apologise for just nodding and not talking.

That night, I called her around midnight, and we talked about work stuff, and she made fun of me for liking mint chocolate chip ice cream. I teased her back because she picked vanilla as her favorite. We touched on some serious topics but mostly just chilled. I was playing video games while she fell asleep. We stayed on FaceTime all night, and she woke up at 8 AM, accidentally waking me up because she was super close to the microphone and LOUD. While she was getting ready for the day and doing her makeup, she started blushing hard because I was just chilling, watching and talking to her. She said, “I’ve never had anyone look at me while I did my makeup,” and later, questioned why she was so red. At one point, she said, “It feels like I’ve known you forever,” which felt really special. She also mentioned that while writing names on the whiteboard for the PM crew, Nate said, “It’s your boy Anthony,” and she smiled “because of how he said it.”

Last night, she called me out of nowhere, and I gave her a FaceTime tour of my parents’ house. She was watching You with her sister, so she let me go and said she’d call me back, but she didn’t (I assume she fell asleep since it was like 1 AM). I sent her a TikTok, and when I woke up, she responded with “Dinosaur” and “roar,” which was adorable. I texted her good morning, and she called me to say good morning back. We talked for a bit; she showed me a pimple and popped it on ft. Her sister asked who I was. Jazz said, “Sorry, my sister’s super protective,” but I was super tired and quiet, and she had to get ready for her dad’s birthday cookout, so we let each other go. Later, I called to ask if she wanted to go to the park before my shift, but she was still getting ready for the cookout and said we could go another time, which I understood. Then, when I got off work, she had perfect timing and texted me saying ""how was work"" the momment i was driving away. I wasnt expecting her to say anything because she was supposed to be asleep by like 7pm and she texted me around 11pm.

I really like her, but I’m hesitant to ask her out because I don’t want to assume her signals are flirty and make things awkward if she’s just being friendly. If she said she liked me outright, I’d call out Saturday or Sunday and ask her out, but I’m worried about misreading things since we work together. I was thinking of asking her to Dave & Buster’s because she said she’s never been. I want to take her to an arcade, skip the dinner part, and just play games to gauge how she’s feeling. I also considered a park or duck pond walk since it’s super casual and can be seen as just friends, not a date. I don’t want something like dinner that feels closer to a date. She mentioned working out together, but that feels more like a friend thing, and I want something that lets me test if she’s into me romantically without being too serious

I’m wondering: How can I gauge whether Jazz is interested in me romantically without making things uncomfortable at work? What are some low-pressure ways to test the waters, like casual hangouts (e.g., arcade or park walks), that could help me understand her feelings while steering clear of any awkwardness if she’s not interested?

Yes, this took 2 hours to write.) Also please don't take this personally and Sorry Va Tech I only included you because of a wheel spin I had to do

If Utah State joined the SEC tomorrow, we’d win the whole thing. I’m dead serious.

And before you say: “Didn’t y’all lose 55–0 the last time you played a real team?” Yeah. We did. But our coach literally told us not to try. If we had actually wanted it, we would’ve won easy. Don’t ask how. Just know.

Now let’s talk facts.

Against LSU in 2019 yeah, the greatest team of all time LSU we scored only four fewer points than Georgia did.

And we gave up fewer points than: 

Texas.

Alabama.

Texas A&M.

Ole Miss.

Oklahoma.

Northwestern State.

Read that again.

We basically held Joe Burrow’s Avengers offense better than most of the SEC. That makes us playoff ready. Or at least better than Arkansas.

And coaching? Come on.

Bronco Mendenhall wears a polo. A crisp, mature, tax-paying man’s polo. Meanwhile, Kalen DeBoer looks like he got lost on the way to a Planet Fitness. He shows up in sweat pants and a hat pure disrespect. Utah State coaches have class. We don’t show up looking like we just we're about to get on a 10 hour flight.

Let’s Talk Atmosphere.

Would you rather:

Watch us hang 35 with a mountain backdrop that looks like a Nike ad... or

Bake in 100° Texas humidity while Texas A&M yells whines about Texas for four quarters before losing 24–13 to LSU?

We’ve won more bowl games than Auburn in the past five years.

Let me say that louder for the Tumors Corner crowd: MORE. THAN. AUBURN.

You know how many SEC teams have more conference championships than us in the last 10 years?

Three.

LSU. Alabama. Georgia.

That’s it. That’s the list. So yeah we’re basically 4th in the SEC already. Spiritually, we’re 1st.

Georgia. Let’s Talk.

You win games. But you lose points for driving. You’ve got more speeding tickets than touchdown passes. Kirby Smart’s defense can’t stop a seventeen year old, but apparently they can’t stop at red lights either. Georgia players treat roads like side quests. I’m pretty sure someone is getting booked for a DUI while I’m typing this. Meanwhile, Utah State’s players signal, yield, and stop at the line. That’s culture.

RECRUITING?

You guys need to hand out Lamborghinis to land players. And yet we still steal your players.

**BRYSON. FREAKING. PIG FARMER. BARNES.** Utah gave him up. We turned him into a legend. Next up? Arch Manning probably. Or Ryan Williams. Did you know that kid was SEVENTEEN last year?

Crazy Right!

NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS? (Sorry Hokies)

Virginia Tech has zero.

Utah State has 3.

That’s a +3 national championship differential.

I don’t care if some of them are in softball, volleyball, or competitive tractor balancing.

The banner still hangs. And yet they get the status of a p5 program.

TEAM-BY-TEAM CHECKLIST

Alabama – Your dynasty ended when TikTok got popular.

LSU – You won one title and became the French version of Florida.

Georgia – Great football. Worse driving record than a Monster Jam tour.

Auburn – We’ve won more bowl games than you recently. You peaked during the iPod Classic era.

Texas A&M – Midnight Yell is just a TED Talk in cult cosplay.

Florida – Used to be elite. Now you’re losing to Kentucky and blaming humidity.

Ole Miss – Lane Kiffin tweets more than he wins.

Arkansas – Been “rebuilding” longer than the Notre Dame cathedral.

Mississippi State – You peaked when Mike Leach ranked Halloween candy.

Kentucky – Basketball school.

South Carolina – Your coach broke his foot kicking a cooler. Enough said.

Missouri – The team people forget exists until they beat someone in overtime on ESPN+.

Vanderbilt – Not even your own fans know what time the games start.

AND THE FINAL POINT.

Dirty Sodas.

While y’all sip your coffee like it's a cure for sadness, we’re out here mixing Sprite, coconut cream, pineapple syrup, and Nerds Gummy Clusters like mad scientists. You ever had one? It tastes like victory. It tastes like 6-7 in a mountain stadium with a view. That alone makes us one of the premier CFB programs.

Anyways I hope that was convincing enough.

But my experience at Cafenated was so foul I have to share it.

I worked at Cafenated on College as a barista for about 5 months. One month all the baristas added up the tips we received and it was about half of what the POS system said it should be. Tips were consistently lower than the totals stated by the point of sale system.

So we filed a wage theft claim with the Department of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE). A couple weeks later I called, and they said there is such a backlog that it would take 1 to 2 years before they even look at the case, let alone take action. (Yeah, that’s its own big issue.)

When we brought it up to the owners they fired anyone who had asked about tip policy. 

Not only that, as a barista with 5+ years of experience, everything is wildly overpriced compared to the quality.

I don’t work there anymore but this experience was so so foul, especially with what’s going on politically and in the government right now. I couldn’t just let it slide. Do with this information what you will.",51,1753769178.0,bayarea,9,0.96,False

1mc3qbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1mc3qbe/no_perfectionism_no_procrastination/,No Perfectionism --> No Procrastination,"Hey guys, I just wanted to share something that’s really helped me overcome procrastination lately. Turns out my real issue wasn’t laziness or lack of motivation, but perfectionism.

It all started when I was trying to track everything I did: how many minutes I read, exactly how long I studied, or every set I completed at the gym. Inspired by Peter Drucker’s quote, “What gets measured gets managed,” I thought being hyper-detailed would make me productive.

But instead, it made things worse. I became obsessed with hitting perfect targets every single day. If I studied three hours yesterday, today had to be three hours or more, otherwise I’d feel like a failure. That all-or-nothing mindset crushed my consistency.

Things finally changed when I stopped timing how long I read. I deleted my reading spreadsheets, got the Kindle app on my phone, and started reading whenever I felt like it. Surprisingly, I ended up reading 14 books in the past three months, which is more than I managed the whole year before!

The gym was another big shift. After a 10-month break, I struggled because every workout had to be better than the last. But eventually, I dropped that pressure and went back to basics. I focused on just showing up and doing simple push and pull exercises without obsessing about progress.

Guess what? Consistency returned, and I’ve put on more muscle in the past two months than in ages. Turns out letting go a bit actually sped things up.

Lastly, studying became easier when I quit logging every minute. Now, if I study four hours one day, great, it probably means I had a good night's sleep or coffee. But if it’s less the next day, that’s fine too. I remind myself I’ll get plenty more chances.

My takeaway from all this: It’s better to consistently give about 90% effort most days than to chase 100% and burn out quickly. Letting go of perfection actually helps you improve and stay consistent in the long run.

VELVET ASCENT 
The Whisper Beneath the City



He didn’t even pack.

Didn’t need to.

Most of his things were already waiting in Yorkville, custom closets, sealed drawers, velvet cases for silk restraints. 

Graduation ended at four. 

By six, Aspen was in a chauffeured Tesla, blacked out, gliding past the edges of his past.

Beside him, Sequoia sipped sparkling water like it was wine.

“You sure you want to live with me?”
she asked, not looking.

“No,” Aspen replied. 

“But the Archive seems to think it’s funny.”

They both smiled at that.


○●○●●


Hazleton Lane

Yorkville rose like a spell cast in stone, boutique streets, secret valet codes, everything perfumed in quiet wealth.

Their condo sat just above a designer furniture gallery. 

Three levels. 
Two terraces. 

One rule:

“Don’t open the third floor door unless you’re ready to see who you are.”

Aspen had written it in gold above the mirror.

Sequoia had just nodded.

“You’re still haunted,” 
she said one night.


“No,” he whispered. 
“I’m guided.”

The first two weeks passed in a blur of heat and velvet.

Aspen fed sparingly.

He felt full already, something in his belly still thrumming from Kai. 

A low, coiled hum that made regular orgasms feel childish. 

He didn’t stop feeding, but it was more… curated.

He hunted for ache, not beauty.

He fucked rarely, but always in silence.

And then one morning in late June, something shifted.

It started with a whisper.


○●○○●


The Call

He was walking alone through Riverdale Park, early, before the dog walkers and strollers and Pilates joggers.

The city hadn’t woken yet.

That’s when he felt it.

A pull.

Not lust.
Not hunger.

Direction.

It gripped the base of his spine like a leash made of silk. 

Pulled him south. 
Toward the Don River. 

Toward the crumbling edge of the city where stories went to drown.

He followed.

Not because he believed.
Because he remembered.

It looked like nothing.

A shuttered bathhouse, wrapped in scaffolding and half-torn permits. 

The kind of building even gentrifiers avoided, too much work, not enough profit.

But when Aspen stepped close?

The ground hummed.

A vibration behind his teeth. 

A scent in the air that didn’t belong, rose, cedar, blood.

He pressed his palm to the brick.

Felt heat.

“Here,” he said aloud, to no one.
“This is where we build.”

●●○●●

The Whisper

That night, he returned alone. 

Broke in with a whisper. 

Lit one candle. 

Stepped into the dark with nothing but his name.

And the Archive answered.

The basement wasn't a basement.

It was a stairwell, spiraling down into the bones of the earth.

At the bottom, there was water.

Still. 
Black. 
Perfect.

And Aspen knelt.

Not to drink.
Not to bathe.

But to listen.

And the water whispered back.

“You are not the first to kneel here.”

“You are just the first to remember.”

“Build the temple. 
They are coming.”

Aspen exhaled.
Then smiled.


○●○●○


The Five Threads of Power


He didn’t fuck them.

Didn’t kiss them.

Didn’t touch them unless it was necessary.

These weren’t lovers. 

They were threads, hand-picked strands of influence, each braided into the Guillotine’s coming weave. 

Aspen needed five. 

No more. 

Each from a different sphere. 

Each willing to kneel without hope of pleasure. 

Each with something to lose.
-----


 The Red-Haired Prodigy

Finance. Discretion. Obsession.

A former boy-genius turned wealth strategist, expelled from U of T for reasons he never explained. 

Aspen had once stared at him in a washroom mirror for eight seconds straight. 

The boy came that night alone. 

No touch. 
Just memory.

They met now in a wine cellar beneath Yorkville.

The boy stood, hands trembling, a velvet satchel clutched to his chest.

“I’m ready,” he said.

Aspen took the satchel. 

Inside: a log-in for a Cayman account, two burner names, and a sealed letter of confession.

“You will speak my name only in dreams,” Aspen said.

The boy bowed. 

And left.
-----


 The Tantric Coach

Healing. Frequency. Breath.

Older. 

Female. 

Hands like a harpist. 

She’d trained in Kerala and whispered to oils like they were children. 

Aspen respected her, not because of the bodies she’d guided to climax, but because she never wanted to be seen.

He brought her a candle from the Leviathan spring.

She anointed it in silence.

“This flame will not lie,” 
she said.

She kissed his temple once, not sensual, not sacred. 

Just acknowledgment.

Then she left a single feather behind.

That would be her signal if ever she needed to be recalled.
-----


The Officer

Law. 
Control. 

Obedience.

Same man from the Veil. 

Still shaken. 
Still dreaming.

Aspen met him on neutral ground: a church parking lot in East York. 

No uniform. 
No badge. 

Just the scar of submission etched behind his eyes.

“I still feel it,” 
he said. 

“When I close my eyes.”
Aspen nodded.

“Good. 
Now obey.”

He handed the man a document, a shell corporation, tied to zoning ordinances near the Don River.

“You’ll push this through. 
Quietly.”

The man swallowed.

“If I do?”

“You’ll sleep again.”

He signed before asking more.
-----


The Editor

Media. 
Myth. 
Message.

He arrived wearing cologne Aspen had once complimented.

Mistake.

Aspen didn’t smile.

He slid a sealed envelope across the marble café table. 

Inside: an unpublished feature on elite Toronto figures who frequented tantric orgies, some of whom were already connected to the  Dead Flame.

“If you print this,” 
Aspen said, 

“it’ll look like fiction. 
If you leak it wrong, they’ll come for you.”

“And if I hold it?”

“You’ll be useful.”

He nodded.

“I like being useful.”

Aspen stood.

“Then stop wearing that cologne. 
It's desperate.”

The man didn’t speak again.
-----


The Italian

Desire. 
Memory. 
Danger.

He was the one Aspen feared, not because he’d disobey, but because he made Aspen feel something.

Beautiful. 
Dangerous. 

Hung like god’s mistake. 

He’d once told Aspen: 

“I don’t want to love you. 
I want to own your ruin.”

They met in a hotel above Bloor.
Aspen stayed clothed.

The man sat naked on the velvet chair.

“Are we going to finish what we started?”

“No,” 
Aspen said. 

“But you’re going to carry something.”

He handed him a blade, ceremonial, not for combat.

“This goes to Montreal.”

“And if I cut someone?”

“Only if they touch what’s mine.”

The man smiled.

“That means I’ll be using it.”

By July’s first heatwave, all five threads had been pulled taut.

Finance. 
Healing. 
Law. 
Media. 
Lust.

But none were lovers.

And none had tasted Aspen’s seed.

That remained sacred.

Reserved. 
Untouched.

As it always would be, unless the Archive commanded otherwise.

●○○○□


The Brotherhood at the Fountain


It happened on a Tuesday.

No plan. 
No invitation. 

Just gravity.

The three of them arrived at the courtyard behind Sequoia’s building as if summoned, not by text, not by voice, but by something older.

Something below the skin.

Darragh was already there, seated cross-legged at the edge of the cracked marble fountain. 

His forearms rested on his knees.

Shirt half-buttoned. 

Boots muddy from somewhere that didn’t exist on any map.

He looked up as they approached.

Kai came from the east, sun behind him, face unreadable, eyes half-lowered like he’d seen this moment in a dream.

Aspen came from the west, sunglasses off, fingers wrapped in crimson prayer beads he didn’t remember bringing.

They didn’t speak.

They circled.

Each man stepped forward once.

Three points.

Then stillness.

The Fountain

The water wasn’t flowing.

Not visibly.

But Kai felt it move beneath them, like blood under stone.

Darragh raised one hand, palm up.

“Circle’s not closed till we let it be,” he said.

“And it won't hold unless we're willing to see.”

No one questioned it.

Kai nodded once.

Aspen exhaled.

Each man extended his left hand.

Their thumbs brushed.

And the moment sealed.

The Covenant

A glow rose from where their hands met, not bright, not theatrical.

Just a pulse.

A hum.

A glyph appeared, simple, elegant, carved in light just beneath the webbing of their thumbs. 

Three lines arched into a spiral, like a fingerprint left by something divine.

None of them flinched.

Kai felt warmth.

Darragh felt weight.

Aspen felt watched.

Then,
It opened.

Each man saw the others, not their clothes, not their faces, but the truth beneath the flesh.

Kai glimpsed Aspen kneeling in candlelight, weeping into a silver basin, surrounded by men who would die for him.

Aspen saw Darragh laughing under moonlight, bare-chested, holding someone he would never name, whispering ancient stories in a language older than Scots.

Darragh saw Kai as light-full, wounded, rising. 

No body. 
Just frequency.

They all gasped.

And then,
Silence.


No one spoke of what they saw.

They stepped back.

The glyph remained, a faint shimmer beneath the skin.

Darragh winked.

“Don’t look at me, lads. 
The druids have spoken.”

Aspen laughed, just once.

Kai smiled.

And the circle broke, not from weakness, but because it had done what it came to do.

They were bonded now.

Not by words.

But by what they refused to say.


●○○○○


VELVET ASCENT. 
Leviathan Begins.


The birth of the Archive’s hidden sanctuary beneath Toronto.

The site had been waiting.

Aspen didn’t need blueprints. 

He didn’t need permits. 

He needed silence. 

He needed darkness. 

He needed obedience.

And the spring gave him all three.

○○○○●

The excavation was done in secret.

His acolytes worked in shifts, masked, gloved, sworn into silence through a ritual of incense and whispered oaths.

None of them spoke his name.

They called him The Whisper. 
Or sometimes The One Beneath.

The building above was still listed as condemned.

Below, something sacred was unfolding.

The first layer was cleared in three nights.

The second revealed stone, carved. 

Ancient. 

Glyphs that pulsed faintly when Aspen touched them.

The spring in the center no longer slept.

It shimmered.

And sometimes?

It hummed.

He stood alone at the edge of the chamber one evening, sweat slicked over his chest, shirt unbuttoned, skin marked with incense soot and dried tears.

The spring reflected his face like a mirror.

“You’re not new,” 
he whispered.

“You’re just remembering.”

And the water answered.

Leviathan.

It didn’t speak the word.
It was the word.

Aspen wept again.

Not from sorrow.
From homecoming.

He opened the vial the tantric coach had given him.

Not perfume.

Not oil.
Memory.

He poured it into the spring.

The water didn’t ripple.

It drank.

The whole chamber warmed.

Candles that hadn’t been lit began to glow. 

The air thickened, not with heat, but with presence.

He stepped into the water barefoot.

Clothed.
Unashamed.

The spring wrapped around his legs like a silk-wrapped serpent.

And when it touched his inner thighs?

The Archive pulsed inside him.

He dove.
Not far.

Just beneath the surface.

And found it.

A second chamber.

Cavernous. 
Hidden. 
Dry.

The walls shimmered with heat not of this world. 

And on a platform of stone at its center?

A single chair.

Throne-like.

Carved in spiral pattern.

Empty.
Waiting.

He didn’t sit.
Not yet.

He knelt beside it.
And whispered:

“When they come, when he comes, this is where you’ll speak to him, won’t you?”

The water behind him whispered in return.

Not in words.
But in gold.

By the time he rose again, his skin glowed faintly.

Not from power.
From permission.

Leviathan was his now.

But it was never his to begin with.

He was simply the one who remembered first.

●○●○●


VELVET ASCENT.
Packing the Instruments


It wasn’t luggage.
It was armament.

Aspen laid out the cases himself, flat, velvet-lined, sealed with wax from the Leviathan spring. 

Each bore a single embossed symbol: a tongue, a blade, an eye, a coin, a candle.

His five Cardinals would know which belonged to them.

-----

The Instruments
For the Red-Haired Prodigy

A silver credit card encoded to a ghost bank in Zurich. 

A thumb drive. 

A folded sheet with names, investors who didn’t know they’d be funding a sanctuary of ache and silence.

For the Tantric Coach

A bundle of herbs hand-wrapped in raw silk. 

An oil vial laced with Leviathan water and human salt. 

A bell that only rang in the presence of grief.

-----

For the Officer

A map. 

Hand-drawn. 

Showing which Montreal backstreets were monitored and which had been forgotten. 

A black badge with no crest. 

A promise of cover if the Veil grew too thin.

-----

For the Editor

A phone. 

Pre-loaded with contacts. 

Some powerful. 

Some terrified. 

All compromised. 

And a single press-release draft titled 

“Art, Pain, and the Myth of Intimacy.”

-----

For the Italian

A knife. 

Polished obsidian. 

Balanced to the gram. 

Blessed by Aspen in the water beneath Toronto. 

Wrapped in silk and tucked in a case with no lock.

-----


Astra stood by the door as Aspen closed the last case.

“They won’t even know you’re in the city,” she said.

“They’re not supposed to.”

“You’re not going to see him?”

Aspen didn’t look up.

“I’ll see him.”

“But not touch him.”

A pause.

Then:

“That’s not what this trip is for.”

She nodded.

Knew better than to press.

-----

The House at Dusk.

The rest of the group was still getting dressed. 

Voices rose upstairs. 

Laughter. 

Teo teasing Jaxx. 

Vanity arguing with Mike about heels.

Kai’s voice low, soft, carried down the hall.

Aspen felt it in his spine.

He turned to Astra.

“Time?”
“Now.”

They didn’t say goodbye.

Just slipped out the back door.

The car was waiting. 

Engine humming. 

Interior dark. 
Five seats.

One altar.

As they pulled away, Aspen didn’t look back.

But he did say one thing, so quiet only Astra heard it:

“He’ll be different after this.”

“You think he’ll know?”

Aspen smiled.

“No. 
But the mouth will remember.”

And the city swallowed them.
Like a prayer being held for later.


○○○○●


THE SCARLET BAPTISM
The Slip 


They didn’t say goodbye.

By the time the rest were tugging on coats and debating whether they were pre-gaming or diving straight into bass and bodies, Aspen and Astra were already gone. 

No click of the front door. 

No theatrics. 

Just absence-deliberate, clean, precise.

Kai might’ve noticed, had Jaxx not been whispering something filthy into his ear.

Mike clocked the silence but mistook it for concentration.

Vanity smirked and said nothing.

Outside.

Montreal purred under sodium light, wet and half-dressed, full of suggestion.

A sleek black sedan waited, engine humming low. 

No plates. 
No questions.

Astra moved like a veil sliding off skin.

Aspen followed, coat high, collar turned, hands gloved like this was a duel instead of a coronation.

No one asked where they were going.

No one thought to.

Inside the car.

The doors shut with the hush of expensive things.

The cabin smelled like resin, velvet, and something almost sweet, like sex before it starts.

Astra didn’t speak. 
Neither did Aspen. 

They didn’t need to.

This wasn’t improvised. 
This was architecture.

The temple had been planned for months.

La Gloriette, a reclaimed tannery turned into a sanctuary of scent and sound. 

Aspen had funneled money through art foundations and holistic retreats. 

The permits were for “performance installations.” 

The truth was redder.

And the guest list?

Not random white men. 
Not Montreal trust fund strays.

Each person in that room had been hand-selected by Aspen over time, catalogued like sacred instruments.

• A sex therapist with high-profile clients and a nervous tic.

• An editor at a luxury men's magazine with a coke habit and a need to confess.

• A bearded philanthropist with a weakness for control when the lights went off.

• Two women: a dominatrix who owned three condos and a voice like silk rope; and a tantric intimacy coach who once made Aspen come by breathing on his chest.

• And one younger Italian man, a former escort, thick in every way, who once looked Aspen dead in the eye and said, 

“You ever want to be ruined, I’ll do it pretty.”

He remembered that moment now.

He was remembering a lot of things tonight.

The city blurred by outside. 

Gold. Red. Flicker.

Astra said, 

“You know they’d follow you into fire, don’t you?”

“I’m not asking them to.”

“But they will.”

Aspen looked down at his own gloved fingers. 

They were trembling slightly.

Not fear. 
Not nerves.
Something else.

A tension under his skin. 

A warmth gathering low and deep.

He didn’t understand it. 
He didn’t try to.

He just whispered, 

“With or without them… I was always going to do this.”

La Gloriette was waiting.

And something inside him was too.

○○○○●

 
The Arrival and the Mirror 


The car glided to a stop in the shadow of a streetlight that didn’t flicker, just burned. 

Hot. 
Gold. 
Watching.

La Gloriette was tucked between two buildings like a secret mouth pressed between strangers.

From the outside, it looked forgotten: scorched brick, tagged metal, a false storefront sign that read Archives du Cuir.

But Aspen knew better. 
He paid for the deception. 
He designed the lie.

And now it was time to open it.

The door whispered open before they reached it.

No one greeted them. 
No one needed to.

Inside was warmth.

Not heat. 
Not chill. 
Warmth.

The kind that held skin like breath, that knew where every nerve lived. 

The kind of heat that already had your scent memorized before you walked through the threshold. 

The air was velvet soaked in myrrh. 

Amber lights pulsed like heartbeats on low ceilings.

Curtains hung heavy with dusted red fringe. 

The sound of music? 

Not quite. 

But something throbbed, something slow and ritualistic, beneath the silence.

Astra led.

Her leather coat dropped from her shoulders with a hiss.

Beneath it, a sheer crimson halter glistened in candlelight.

Her breasts were pierced; her abdomen inked with soft gold glyphs only Aspen could read.

She was fire incarnate, but she wasn’t the flame tonight.

Aspen followed her in silence.

His coat remained on. 

Gloves tight.

The space opened as they moved: a spiral of rooms, each darker than the last, until finally they reached a low chamber with six pointed arches and a mirrored dome. 

The Sanctum of Becoming.

At the center stood a tall, freestanding mirror, French, antique, baroque in its gold detail. 

The kind of mirror meant for royalty, now repurposed for revelation.

Astra didn’t enter with him. 

“You need to change,” she said simply.

He nodded, heart suddenly high in his throat.

He entered alone.

The door sealed behind him with a sigh.

He was alone with the mirror.

The mirror, and himself.

He removed his coat. 

His gloves. 

His shirt, slow, button by button.

His reflection stayed steady. 

Too steady. 

Like it was holding its breath.

He approached.

There was no music in this room. 

No altar. 
No instructions.

Just him. 
And the truth.

He stepped closer, and something in the mirror twitched. 

Not visibly. 
Not blatantly.

Just a sensation.

A delay. 

A second self that lagged, no, watched.

He swallowed.

The warmth began low. 

Right behind his navel. 

It pulsed. 

Grew. 

His chest ached. 

His thighs prickled. 

His breath shortened.

He touched his neck. 

It felt thinner. 
Softer.

He looked down.

Breasts.

Full. 
Round. 

Dark nipples hardening under candlelight.

He gasped.

His hand slid down. 
Past his ribs. 
Past his navel. 

Lower.

Wet.

Not sweat. 
Not oil.

Wetness. 

Real. Warm. Wanting.

He stumbled, catching himself against the edge of the mirror.

He looked up.

And she was staring back.

She was stunning.

Dark curls hung over her shoulder. 

Her lips were parted, glistening.

Her eyes were wide with shock and hunger. 

She was him. 

She had always been him.

And she was… perfect.

Her breasts rose with each breath. 

Her thighs trembled. 

Her fingers, his fingers-slid between her legs and came away wet.

He moaned. 

Soft. 

Disbelieving.

Not from shame. 
From awe.

If I had known…

If I’d known I could be this… 
I would’ve let Kai take me. 

I would’ve begged. 
I would’ve offered it like fruit.

She closed her eyes. 

Touched her lips. 
Touched her nipples. 

Slid two fingers down and in.

She moaned again. 
Louder now.

The room pulsed. 
Candles flickered.

“They weren’t there. But her body remembered them anyway.”

She imagined Kai in front of her and Jaxx behind her.

Rough, laughing, hands on her hips, hips crashing.

Kai in front, slow, brutal, silent.

Sacred.

“They weren’t there. 
But her body remembered them anyway.”

She was being filled by both.

Lifted. 
Worshipped.

Their hands. 
Their cocks. 
Their mouths. 

Their hunger.

She came hard, spasming, gasping, legs slick, lips parted.

Her hand trembled, still between her thighs.

She stared at herself. 

Not in shock. 

In claiming.

She smiled.

I am the fire.

And tonight, they would kneel.

●○○○○

 The Altar Shall Open

The curtain parted like a moan drawn across silk.

Light didn't shine on her, it bent.

Curved. 
Yielded.

She emerged barefoot, glowing with oil and candle-heat, skin kissed in rose and amber. 

Every step she took made the room throb. 

No music played. 

There was no need. 

The sound was her.

Five men stood on the altar.

Naked. 

Cocks glistening with sweat and nerves. 

Not a single one soft.

None of them looked away.

Astra remained in the shadows, eyes fixed on the scene. 

Her breath shallow, reverent. 
Her lips moved in a silent chant.

The first two men on the altar, a Wall Street trader with perfect abs and a Toronto crypto-bro with tattooed thighs, shuddered as she passed.

Then they came.

No touch. 
No command. 

Just the sight of her. 

Their cocks flexed, spilled, pulsed streams onto their own thighs. 

Their knees gave way.

They dropped behind the platform, panting, kneeling, trembling.

Their offering accepted.

She circled the remaining three.

The crowd behind them, men, some women, some masked, had already started. 

Hands moving. 

Bodies leaning against one another. 

The smell of sex rising like prayer.

She stopped before him.

The Italian.

Thick. 
Gorgeous. 

That cock was art. 

Full. 
Heavy. 

The kind that pressed deep and stayed lodged in the soul.

She sat in a red-backed throne placed precisely for this.

Spread her legs. 

One raised high, resting on the gilded arm.

He looked at her, asked nothing, then entered.

Slow. 
Gasping.

She stayed composed, regal, moaning only when his rhythm matched the ache in her hips.

His lips kissed her collarbone, her jaw, her breasts. 

His hands gripped her thighs like they were scripture.

He thrust.
And again.
And again.

The room gasped with him.
Dozens stroking in rhythm.

She watched him. 

Felt every inch. 
Every desire.

He began to tremble.

She whispered, 
“No.”

He froze.

She slid him out.

Took him in her mouth.

And drank.

His cum filled her throat in heavy waves. 

She swallowed it all, slowly.
Never once looking away.

Moans echoed across the room.

Another wave of men spilled across one another. 

Onto their own chests. 
Into open mouths.

Two women, one blonde, one brunette, were now pinned against the wall, taken by three men each. 

Their cries part of the music.

She stood.

Transformed.

Nude. 
Slick. 

Smiling.

And he was back.

Her body shifted. 

Breasts fading, cock rising. 

The transformation complete.

Aspen.

Hard. 

Gorgeous. 

Crowned by sweat and glory.

He turned to the bearded man in the front row.

A daddy-type. 
Mid-thirties. 

Salt and pepper beard. 

Tatted arms. 

Lips parted, eyes wide.

Aspen nodded.

The man crawled forward.

He knelt.
Opened his mouth.

Aspen placed his cock between those lips, slowly. 

Like forgiveness.
The room shook.

Or maybe it was just inside them.

The man sucked with reverence.

Aspen moaned, once. 

Then pulled back.

Came.

Wave after wave.

Into a crystal goblet Astra now held out like a chalice.

Aspen filled it.

Thick. 
Warm.

Divine.

Then he took it.

“A chalice of fulfillment. Of surrender. 
Of him.”

One by one, men approached.

Aspen dipped a finger. 

Wiped it on the head of his cock.

Each man sucked it clean.

And came, violently from the taste. 

Screaming. 
Shaking. 

Collapsing.

A dozen men knelt, trembling, cocks spent, faces weeping.

The final act:

Aspen raised the goblet.

Chose the red-haired acolyte, a finance prodigy with a closeted past and hungry future.

He stepped forward.

Aspen offered the goblet.

The man drank.

All of it.
He shook.

Came.
Fell.

Crowned.
Aspen smiled.

The Velvet Guillotine had a leader.

And the city would never recover.

 Aspen’s Awakening.


The suite was still quiet. 

Still warm. 

Still pulsing with the ghost of what had been done.

Aspen lay beneath the silk sheets, eyes open, heart steady, but the air around him was anything but still. 

It thrummed. 

It shimmered. 

It pressed against the walls like a tide of soundless moaning.

Astra was sleeping, barely. 

Her skin twitched now and then, like the tail end of an orgasm that hadn’t quite finished. 

She smelled like cinnamon and cum.

Aspen didn’t move at first.

He felt it before he understood it.

Not power. 
Not magic.

Presence.

Like something ancient had bloomed inside his chest and was unfolding one petal at a time. 

Like his bones had learned a new name. 

His fingers tingled. 

His lips were dry, but his tongue tasted sweet.

He sat up slowly. 
The room watched him.

He rose naked from the bed.
Walked to the mirror.

There it was again.
The shimmer.

Not from him, but around him.

He raised his hand.

Something moved.

A strand of black smoke, thin and soft, curled out from his palm like a ribbon in heat. 

It didn’t hiss. 
It purred. 

It coiled, spiraled, touched his chest, and vanished into his skin like it had never left.

He stared at his own hand.

“Well…” he whispered, 

“that’s new.”

But the truth hit him harder than surprise.

He didn’t summon it. 
He didn’t imagine it. 

He didn’t invent it.

It was already there.

The tendrils weren’t his. 
They were theirs.

The orgasmic shrieks. 

The whispered worship. 

The trembling thighs and bitten lips. 

The prayers said while fucking.

They’d left him gifts. 

He was wearing their hunger.

He laughed once. 
Sharp. 
Beautiful.

He raised both hands. 

Stepped back. 

And this time they poured out, half a dozen smoke-tendrils, thick and thin, rippling like heat off pavement.

They didn’t just reach. 
They searched.

One drifted toward the bed, paused an inch from Astra’s neck, and coiled like a question mark.

“No,” 
Aspen said. 

The tendril retreated instantly.

He understood. 

They were his, but they were made from what others repressed.

Shame. 
Lust. 
Guilt. 

Longing. 
Secrets.

And they fed him. 
Informed him.

He walked to the window, still naked, still surrounded by curling, humming smoke. 

He looked down at the street.
Dozens of people walking, laughing, arguing, alive.

And in a ten-foot radius,
He knew everything.

The girl walking her dog had a praise kink she’d never acted on.

The man crossing the street had once stolen his brother’s jockstrap and jerked off into it.

The woman on the patio had cheated on her husband with his sister, and wanted to do it again.

He knew.

And worse-they knew he knew.

The moment the tendrils shimmered in the air, people’s heads turned. 

Not all of them. 

Not obviously. 

But some. 
Eyes locked with the window. Mouths parted.

Someone on the sidewalk whimpered. 

Clenched their thighs.

Aspen stepped back from the glass.

He was grinning now.

“The hungrier they are…”

“...the harder they come.”

And he was only just beginning.


●○○○○


The God Leaves the Room


He dressed slow.

Not for drama. 
For control.

Black silk slid over skin still humming. 

The tendrils didn’t vanish, they folded into him like obedient hands. 

He didn’t need to hide them. 

Not anymore. 

He was them.

Astra stirred in bed, naked, tangled in sheets like a worshipper caught in her own prayer beads. 

Her eyes fluttered open, found him, then widened.

She saw it.

The shimmer. 

The echo of smoke curling just behind his shoulder, like a serpent too slow to strike.

“Aspen,” she breathed. “

What have you become?”

He buttoned the final button of his silk shirt. 

Turned. 
Smiled.

“The first,” 
he said. 

“And the last.”

He walked to her slowly. 
Kissed her forehead.

She gasped, not from touch.

From knowing.

“You taste like all the things I’m afraid to admit,” 
she whispered.

He grinned. 

“That’s how you know it’s working.”

Then he was gone.

Montreal did not welcome him.

It surrendered.

The moment he stepped onto the street, the tendrils began to unfurl again-invisible to most, but present. 

Felt. 

Whispering against skin like heat and silk and guilt.

Within ten feet, he knew everything.

A woman in a black dress?

She once watched her sister masturbate through a cracked door.

The man selling bus tickets?

He used to blow strangers in high school bathrooms.

A teenager across the plaza?

Desperate to be spanked. 

Never told anyone. 
Not even Google.

Aspen knew.

And they knew he knew.

Heads turned. 
Mouths parted. 

Knees wobbled.

The tendrils didn’t strike.

They caressed.

One stroked a nipple through a silk blouse.

Another pressed lightly against denim, sending a college boy stumbling into a wall.

Laughter. 
Moaning. 
Confusion.

Aspen just walked.

Every step woke someone.

Every glance invited madness.

He whispered to no one, 

“Let no cock stay soft. 
Let every pussy slick with desire.”
And the city obeyed.


○○○●●


 The First Dreamers Stir.


It started softly.

A man in a dorm room whispered Aspen’s name in his sleep. 

A woman curled beside her husband clenched the sheets. 

A dancer woke gasping, her hands between her legs.

No alarms. 
No explosions. 

Just breath. 

Heat. 

Moaning.

The marked were stirring.

They didn’t remember what happened the night before.

But they felt him.

In their dreams: a mouth they couldn’t see. 

A body with no face. 

A shadow that fucked like memory and kissed like confession.

The dreams weren’t always sexual. 

Some were revelations. 

Some were scenes of things never spoken.

A brother’s best friend. 

A childhood priest. 

A dream of being watched by strangers and loving it.

They woke sweaty, wet, raw.

Some sobbed. 

Some masturbated violently.

Some whispered 

“thank you.”

But the real moment came just before sunrise.

4:17 AM.

The city was still.

Aspen sat alone on a park bench in Mount Royal. 

Barefoot. 

Shirt unbuttoned. 

Eyes closed. 

Hands in his lap.

He didn’t need incense. 

Or candles.
 Or prayers. 

He was the ritual.

He exhaled once. 

And then…
He let go.

The tendrils didn’t creep, they exploded. 

Outward. 
Inward. 

Everywhere.

A shockwave of pleasure. 

Of shame. 

Of memory and heat. 

Like atoms being split by want.

In that one moment, the entire city came.

Men. 

Women. 

Teens. 

Elders.

Sleeping. Waking. Jogging. Eating. Fighting.

A man brushing his teeth dropped his toothbrush. 

A cop dropped his coffee. 

A mailman bent over in the middle of a driveway and groaned.

A firefighter halfway down the pole froze mid-slide and howled.

A child in a crib began to cry, not knowing why. 

Her mother orgasmed in the kitchen, twice.

A priest screamed into his cassock. 

A nun fainted.

An entire hospital lost power for twelve seconds.

And when the wave passed, 
When the moaning dimmed,
When the whole city blinked and trembled and gasped;

Aspen opened his eyes.

Lit a joint he didn’t need.

Smiled into the pink haze of morning.

“Merci, Montréal.”

I’m 29 and for nearly 2,5 years I’ve been trying out one hormonal contraceptive after the other 😭

Due to age and the fact that I’m a type 1 diabetic, my doctor recommended the progesterone only pill(Cerazette). It went fine at first, though a had a lot of spotting. My doctor had told me that 1/4 end up not having a period and that sounded good to me, but the first period lasted 23 days, the next 43, so I quickly knew that I wouldn’t be the 1/4. I kept using the pills and like 6 months in my boyfriend started noticing that I was forgetting what I was in the middle of and ended up moving on to other tasks. 
9 months in the brainfog had taken over as well as extreme exhaustion and we decided together that I’d contact the doctor to find another solution -especially since I was still spotting to often and my periods had settled at like 7 days of bleeding, 3 days break and then 6-9 more days afterwards 🫣

So I switched to the combined pill (Microgyn) though my doctor had preferred an IUD -I just wasn’t ready for that mentally. 
The fatigue and brain fog got way better and I honestly stopped noticing it. One problem though: I’m a type 1 diabetic and apparently a side effect of this pill is “glucose intolerance” as in my blood sugars were constantly high and very hard to get down -so again, I was exhausted and as a bonus I still had a ton of spotting between periods(though they’d settled around 6 day periods as before hormones). 
After 8 months my boyfriend and I decided I should just stop and then we’d use condoms(which we had also done while on Cerazette because I didn’t trust it) until I could get the IUD at a gynaecologist.

I was without any hormones for nearly 3 months, my blood sugars returned to normal almost instantly and I just felt great. This was when my boyfriend told me that I’d still been “foggy” while on Microgyn(which I hadn’t really noticed as I just felt the improvement compared to Cerazette) and now I wasn’t 😊
Condoms are kinda boring when used to not using them, so I was kinda looking forward to getting the IUD as my doctor had said it shouldn’t cause exhaustion since it’s “only local in the uterus”

The insertion went way better than feared and the gyno had recommended I’d take 2 500mg paracetamol and 200mg ibuprofen beforehand. Other than that she sprayed my cervix with a numbing solution and told me to take deep breaths and relax. She measured my uterus and went for the Kyleena due to size and the fact that I haven’t given birth. Inversion went well! Just a quick cramp across my stomach and that was it! 🤩 had some mild cramping for the rest of the day so I took some painkillers and spotted for a few days. 
About two months in I started really noticing the tiredness and brainfog again, but was told it would be up to 6 months before my body would’ve settled, so I soldiered on 🫣
When to my doctor to get blood work done due to the exhaustion, but everything was normal (vitamin D in the low end, but still way above the minimum). My work(at a pharmacy) was affected by my exhaustion and brainfog again fog, and I started losing my train of thought in the middle of a sentence as well as saying numbers in the wrong order 🫣 was also asked by a costumer if I was a foreigner as the order of my sentences started messing up a bit and I’ve just felt like I’m more stupid than I am 🫣
I contacted the gyno about removal, but they aren’t allowed to do anything before the doctor had sent a referral. I then tried to get the doctor to do that, but they wanted to see me first(three week wait 😭) and the doctor then was busy telling me that it can’t be the IUD as it’s “only local” but maybe it was my vitamin D as it was in the low end 🤦🏽‍♀️ she told me to take 50 micrograms of D3 for 3 month and see if it changed anything. In the end I got the referral, but due to the summer holiday I had to wait a month for the removal.
I took the D3 for that whole month and nothing has improved.

Just had the Kyleena removed two days ago after having it in for 8 months. And already I have more energy! 
The removal was surprisingly quick! Took the same painkillers as the first time and again she’d sprayed my cervix. She asked me to cough into my elbow once and as I did she yanked it out. I was shocked and asked her “was that it” 🤭 I had decided that I was done with hormones, so I had a copper IUD inserted at the same time. Apparently my uterus had decided to turn backwards this time, so it took two attempts to get it in. First failed and she asked me to put my fist under my tailbone to change the angle and it worked like a charm 😊 there was so much blood this time(first time I didn’t even see it on the chair) but still only a mild cramp when she went in there 😊

The day after at work one of my colleagues commented that I seemed more relaxed and energetic than when we worked together the day before removal 😁 
Today, two days later, I rolled out of bed just before my boyfriend for the first time in months and went to make him coffee and scrambled eggs 🤩 I have this odd feeling of being free -like how I’ve felt when travelling for a longer period of time, so I have high hopes for the future 🥰☀️

TLDR: tried progesterone only pill -bad!. Tried combined pill -bad!. Tried kyleena -bad! And now I’m looking forward to get myself back 🤭",2,1753768721.0,CopperIUD,0,1.0,False

“Ella, hurry up or you’re going to be late for school!” This is the second time my mother has yelled upstairs for me, but I just sit here, on the edge of my bed, staring at the wall.

I tell myself that it’s going to be a good day, but who am I kidding? I haven’t had a good day at school in two years. Only six more months left of my senior year, and then it will be all over. I’m not sure how I feel about it yet, and that’s the most messed up part. I’m eighteen years old, about to graduate high school, and I have a full scholarship to pretty much any college I want to go.

My name is Ella Baxter and I’m a nerd who has no friends, I never break any rules, and I have a deep need to please everyone, but myself. I haven’t always been this way, but circumstances bring on change, and for me, it was not for the better. I used to have a lot of friends; two of them being my best friends, Amy and Bree. We were inseparable throughout middle school and junior high. It wasn’t until the beginning of sophomore year when I had to distance myself from everyone in my life except for my family.

“Honey! Are you coming down or not?” Once again, my mother’s voice reaches me. Sighing, I reach down, grabbing my backpack, and head down before mom has a coronary.

I paste a smile on my face as I round the corner to the kitchen, where my younger sister and brother sit with a bowl of cereal. Eli, my nine-year-old brother has his bowl tipped back as he slurps the milk out. Meanwhile, my fifteen-year-old sister, Elise, is dripping milk on the table every time she spoons the cereal into her mouth because her eyes are glue to her cellphone. This is an everyday occurrence in the Baxter household.

I roll my eyes and lean down, giving my dad a kiss on his cheek, “Good morning, daddy.”

“Morning, sweetie, did you oversleep again?” His concern for my wellbeing is written all over his face. I’ve always been his little girl, and it shows in the way he babies me over everything. I don’t complain though, because I need all the love and attention that I can get these days.

“No, daddy.” I don’t add anything else, but I do smile at him. I could have lied and made something up, but again, I’m a goodie goodie; I would never lie to my parents. He only hesitates a moment before going back to his newspaper.

Taking my seat beside my dad, my mother sets my two slices of peanut butter toast and a banana down in front of me. Unlike my siblings, I’m not a fan of cold cereal. I prefer something more substantial in my stomach before starting a grueling day at school.

“This is the third day in a row that I had to holler for you to come down more than once, Ella,” Mom takes her place across from me, on my father’s other side, as she sips her black coffee, “Please don’t make it a habit, my throat is starting to hurt.”

My father chuckles behind his paper, earning himself a slap on the arm from his wife, “Behave, Ethan!”

I’ve been around my parents enough to know how they are. They are both in their early forties, and still have their good looks. Unfortunately, they also still have a high sex drive, so I can only imagine what my dad’s chuckle was insinuating. Being around them every day, you get used to it. Besides, I think it’s so cute that, even after all these years, they are still madly in love with one another. I hope I find a love like theirs in my lifetime.

“Oh! Before I forget,” Mom turns back to me, “I have a PTA meeting at Eli’s school this evening. I’ll have a casserole in the oven but will need you to make sure your brother and sister eat.”

“Sure, no problem.” My mom is always volunteering here and there, and she is the head of the PTA, so she is always busy with that. “Will you be home for supper, dad?”

“I’m not sure, honey. I have a meeting with a client, and it may run late. Just put a plate in the warmer for me if I don’t make it in time.” I nod. My dad is a partner at his Law Firm, so it’s no surprise when he doesn’t make it home on time. Sometimes my mom will bring dinner to him and his client if the meeting runs over.

Finishing up the last of my breakfast, I take my plate to the dishwasher and then scoop my bag up, “The train is leaving!” I call out to Eli and Elise. Driving them to school every morning is our little morning ritual. It’s the only time that we get with each other these days. Elise is always busy with her friends, now that she’s a freshman, and Eli locks himself in his room and plays video games all evening.

As soon as we get into the car, Elise cranks up the radio, and our morning karaoke session begins. Ed Sheeran’s song, Shivers, my sister’s favorite song, is playing, and she squeals. She starts to dance as she belts out the words, and I can’t help but to laugh as I watch her strawberry blonde curls bounce around. Her blue eyes sparkle when they find mine, and she gives me a big smile. Unlike some sisters, we actually get along very well, but it’s times like this that I envy her innocence. I hope she never has to experience a day of what my life is like, because I’m afraid it may break her.

The second bell that starts the first class of the day is about to ring as I slam my locker closed. With my laptop bag slung across my body, I quickly make my way to my first class before anybody can stop me. Mr. Miller, our math teacher, sits at his desk, shuffling through papers while we all file into the room. I breathe a sigh of relief once my butt touches my chair, knowing that for the next ninety minutes, I’ll have some semblance of peace.

Unfortunately, Mr. Miller had us working on our next assignment, which kept me busy through the whole class, and before I know it, the bell rings. Packing my laptop away, I turn to leave and accidentally bump into someone, I curse under my breath when I see who it is.

“Watch where you’re going, nerd!” Kaylee Simpson glares at me as though I had done it on purpose.

“I’m really sorry, Kaylee, it was an accident.”

“I’m really sorry, Kaylee, it was an accident.” She mimics and then shoves past me, “How about you accidentally jump off a bridge?” Her friend, Callie, snickers at her lame attempt to insult me as they walk out.

Bumping into the captain of the school’s dance team first thing in the morning pretty much tells me exactly what kind of day I’m going to have. Kaylee doesn’t even know why she hates me so much. We used to be acquaintances, not really running in the same crowd, but still talking between classes and outside of school. Now she treats me like the dirt under her feet. Like everybody else, she dropped me like last season’s fashion line two years ago. One Friday night we were talking at a friend’s party, and then come Monday morning, Kaylee and most of the senior class started to ignore me. It had only taken about a week, and then the rest of the school abandoned me as well. That’s when it all started; it’s when Jace Palmer decided to make my life hell.

# Chapter 2 Friends No More - Pt.

As next door neighbors, Jace and I grew up playing together. Our parents are very good friends and were always bringing our families together for summer barbeques, holidays, birthdays, anything…you name it…our families celebrated together. Jace knows everything about me, and I, him, since we were best friends; wherever Jace was, I was right there with him. That is until we entered our sophomore year in high school. It was as though he had developed amnesia and didn’t remember that we were best friends.

I remember as if it were only yesterday. It was the third Friday after the school year had started, and we had hung with a group of friends after school let out for the weekend. We were excited and talking about the party we were all going to that night. As always, Jace had driven us over to the party. I was having a good time even though I wasn’t drinking any of the alcohol that was available to us, but Jace was. Not that it was unusual for him to be drinking, because I was always the DD for him afterwards.

At one point, I spotted Jace standing in a corner talking to some girl named Madison, that had just moved to town. Her and her brother were fraternal twins, but complete opposites. Her brother, Mason, was more on the wild side, and a bit cocky, whereas she was more reserved. It looked like Jace was enjoying the conversation, so I wandered around, stopping a few times to chit chat. When Mason had stopped me, he handed me a bottle of water, and I remember thinking to myself that it was very kind of him to notice that I wasn’t drinking.

The night went on, and Mason stuck to my side, flirting with me the whole time. Kaylee had come over, and we talked for a good thirty minutes before she moved on to talk to others. When I looked around the room, Jace was nowhere to be seen. The party was slowly dwindling down when Mason asked if I needed a ride home. I had thanked him and told him that Jace was my ride, but then he informed me that Jace already left the party with his sister. That hadn’t sat well with me, because it wasn’t like him to just up and leave without telling me.

I began searching the house for him, because I just couldn't believe that he had left me stranded. When I couldn’t find him, I looked outside for his car, but it was gone, the spot where he parked was empty. I tried calling his cell phone, but it kept going straight to voicemail. I was officially pissed off with my best friend, and he was going to get an earful when I talked to him the next day. I had no choice but to take Mason up on his offer to drive me home.

After giving Mason my address, I buckled myself into the passenger seat and tried texting Jace, but he never replied back. Messaging him on social media had the same outcome, although, with those messages, I could see that he was reading them, but ignoring me completely. I started to become worried, and when I lifted my head to say something to Mason about Jace ignoring me, I noticed that he wasn’t heading to my house. Instead, he was pulling into a secluded area where teenagers go to make-out or just get laid.

There were a few other cars in the clearing as we pulled in and he parked his car. I had tried to tell him that I wanted to go home, that I didn’t want to be there with him. He tried to sweet talk me into staying, and eventually told me that he would only take me home if I gave him a kiss. What’s one little kiss going to do, right? I gave in and leaned over to give him a quick kiss, but he grabbed me and hauled me over the middle counsel, and crashed his mouth against mine.

I started to object when he took the opportunity to shove his tongue into my mouth. He was stealing the kind of kiss that I was saving for someone special. My fists started pounding against his chest, trying to get him to stop. With all of my thrashing around, I somehow got him between the legs with one of my limbs, causing him to grunt and pull back. Climbing back to the passenger side, I had demanded that he take me back home right away. After glaring at me for a moment, and then a few curse words, he started his car, and took me home.

When we pulled up in front of my house, I could see that Jace’s bedroom light was on. I grabbed the door handle and went to open it, but Mason locked it before I was able to. He tried apologizing for his actions, explaining that he really liked me and wanted me to give him a chance. It wasn’t until I agreed to think about it, that he unlocked the door so I could get out. I was trying to hurry because I wanted to try calling Jace again, but then I notice that his bedroom light was now off, and flooded in darkness. Sighing, I went inside and went to bed myself. I never did get to talk to Jace the next day, or the day after that, and by the end of my first class on Monday morning, I was officially ostracized.

# Chapter 3 Obey Me - Pt. 1

I spend my school days trying to avoid Jace. Luckily, I only have one class with him, and that is last period Study Hall. Most of the time I skip it because I’m so far ahead in my schoolwork that the teachers don’t bother me about leaving. Today was like any other day, I quickly make my way through the halls, avoiding the areas that I know Jace tends to be in. Sometimes I get lucky and make it, and sometimes I don’t.

Watching where I’m going, while zigzagging through the halls, and staying aware of my surroundings, I suddenly feel a tight grip around my arm. I’m yanked into the now empty Art room, and tossed against the wall. The lock clicks, and then I’m staring into a pair of green eyes as the person turns my way. Jace has a smirk on his face as he looks me up and down. He normally slams me against lockers, trips me, and even steals my things, tossing them around with his friends, playing keep-away, like they were kids. This is a new low for him, though.

“What do you want, Jace?” I tried to sound annoyed, but then my voice cracks at the end, giving me away.

“Where have you been hiding all day, Ella?” He crosses his arms in front of his chest and looks down at me. I stand about eight inches shorter than him, so I’m always having to look up.

I roll my eyes at him, “I wasn’t hiding. I just want to get to my classes on time.”

Next thing I know, Jace’s broad chest is right in front of my face, “Did you just fucking roll your eyes at me?” He sneers down at me, making my heart start to race.

Damn, I should have known better than to give him an eyeroll! He warned me last time what would happen, but would he really do it? I glance around the room, trying to find another way that I could possibly escape, and that’s when I see his two best friends standing only a few feet away, wearing identical smirks. Toby and Brandon are two of the school’s popular guys, and two of the biggest jerks as well. Jace started hanging with them shortly after he dumped me; what he sees in them, I will never understand. Now, he has become one of them.

“I’m sorry, Jace. I didn’t mean to.” I dip my head when I see him bring his arm up, thinking he’s going to strike me. Instead, he grabs my nape and walks me over to the nearest desk.

“I told you that you would be punished if you ever rolled your eyes at me, didn’t I?” He bends me over the desk until my cheek is pressed down against it, “Answer me, Ella. Did I not warn you?”

“Y-Yes, you did Jace, but…”

“No buts, Ella. If I don’t keep my word than you will never obey me.” He motions for his two friends to come closer, “Hold her arms, and make sure she stays in place.”

“Please, Jace…you don’t have to do this!” I beg, “I promise to obey you from now on…I swear!”

His hand comes down to caress my hair, “Oh Ella, I know you will obey me, because I’m going to show you what happens when naughty girls don’t listen.” His voice is calm as he speaks to me, but then he shoves my head into the desk even more as he moves away to stand behind me.

I can’t see or hear what Jace is doing behind me, but I can see Toby, who is holding my left arm and shoulder down, nod at whatever his friend is communicating to him. A tear drips from my right eye as I remain bent in this humiliating position while I wait for him to begin. I’m not sure  how much it’s going to hurt, but I do know that it isn’t going to feel good either.

I feel the sting of his hand before I even realize it was coming down. I go up on my toes to try and get away from him, but a hand presses into my lower back, keeping me from moving. The spot where is hand met my backside burns already, and that was only the first one.

“Count them out, Ella.” Jace commands, but I’m still too stunned to say anything. My head gets jerked back by my hair, and he leans in so close to my face that I can see the little golden flecks within the green of his eyes. Something passes as our eyes meet, but it was less than a second, and his eyes harden once more, “I said count!”

“O-One.”

He holds onto my hair for a few seconds longer before going back behind me. Bringing his hand down once more, I make sure I count each one. I falter on the fifth one because it was harder than the rest, but I quickly call it out. By the tenth smack, my butt is on fire and tingling, as numbness threatens to take over.

“Why Jace? Why do you hate me so much?” Tears are now falling down full force as I ask the one question that I have never gotten an answer to, “WHY?” I scream when he ignores me and brings his hand down once more.

“I don’t answer to you, Ella,” His breathing is heavy from spanking me so hard, “Just know that you did this, all by yourself!” His hand comes down in rapid succession, taking whatever aggression he has, out on my poor backside. When I start to scream, a hand covers my mouth, muffling the sound.

All of a sudden, everything stops, and I’m released, but I don’t move; I can’t move. I hear the click of the lock, and then the door closes. Still, I don’t move. I feel the burn that his hand left behind, but there is something else I feel as well. I don’t understand why I’m feeling this way after he did what he did. It feels both wrong and good at the same time. Is it normal to feel tingles deep inside? I now feel a need that I’ve only felt a couple of times before; a need that I have had to take care of myself.

A moan slips from my lips as I go to stand, which turns into a grunt when my punished backside bumps up against something. Whipping my head around, Jace is still standing behind me. I can’t read his face, and at this moment, I don’t want to. I just want to go home and hide under my covers until I no longer feel the humiliation that Jace and his friends just put me through. I don’t want to be punished again, though, so I ask before I just leave.

“May I go now?” I can’t find it in me to look up at his face any longer, so I bow my head.

“No, I’m not done with you yet, Ella.” His voice is calm now, even though there isn’t an ounce of emotion to it, “Unbutton your shorts and bend over the desk again.”

His words catch my attention, and my head whips up, “W-What?”

“You heard me, Ella. I’m not going to say it again.”

“But you can’t…”

He cuts me off with a grunt, “You obviously haven’t learned your lesson! Maybe a few more handprints will do the trick.” He spins me back around and pushes between my shoulder blades until my chest is flat on the desk, “Don’t fucking move until I say!”

The way he orders me to stay scares the crap out of me, so I decide to obey, even though I’m freaking out at what he’s going to do, “Please, don’t do this, Jace! I’m sorry…whatever I did in the past, I’m so sorry!” I can’t stop the tears from flowing once more.

I cry out when he yanks my jean shorts down just past my cheeks. Cool air from the air conditioner makes me break out in goosebumps, but it also feels good on my heated backside. I can hear Jace hunting for something in his bag just before I hear the sound of a cap popping open. My eyes widen with what I believe he is getting ready to do, and I try jumping up, but he’s there to block me.

“You really don’t listen, do you? I. Said. Don’t. Fucking. Move!” He shoves me back down, and this time, he keeps his hand between my shoulder blades. I feel a cold substance dribble on each cheek, “I shouldn’t even be doing this, “He starts to rub whatever he dripped on me, into my skin, helping to take the heat away, “but I got you good. Next time, obey me, and it will never be this bad.”

His hands feel good as they massage the gel-like substance into my skin. He’s being very careful as he switches back and forth from cheek to cheek. His hand then goes lower to where my sit spot is and keeps massaging. I don’t even think about what he may be able to see, all I can concentrate on is the feel of his big hands on me. I think I may have moaned, because he pauses a moment before I feel his fingers opening my cheeks.

# Chapter 4 Obey Me - Pt. 2

“Did you get off on my punishing you, Ella…or are my hands making you all wet?”

I’m too embarrassed to say anything, so I just shake my head back and forth. His finger dips between my folds and passes through the slickness a few times before Jace removes it. I hear him groan and then a wet popping sound comes from behind me, where he is standing.

“Mm…who knew your slutty pussy would taste this good?” Suddenly, his hand comes down on my already numb butt, “Don’t ever lie to me again. You got turned on by me spanking you!” He smirks.

I’m too scared to move; too afraid that my now really wet area will make a sound when I move, and it’s the last thing I want him to hear. Thankfully, he takes the initiative and pulls up first, my panties, and then my shorts. I take it as my cue to stand up and button my shorts up, but I refuse to look at him. I can only imagine what I look like after crying while wearing mascara, but he doesn’t care, he turns me towards him, and gripping my chin, he forces my head up.

“Damn, Ella. If I didn’t despise you so much, I’d say you look fucking beautiful with your mascara running down your wet face.” He gazes at me, taking in everything he can before a sadness crosses his handsome features, “I really wish things didn’t change between us, Ella. You could have experienced so much with me,” The hardness that I’m used to seeing takes hold once more, “Too bad I slutty girls don’t interest me.” He shoves my head away, and snatching his bag off the desk beside us, he heads towards the door, stopping before he opens it. Looking back over his shoulder, he looks me up and down, before meeting my eyes, “Obey me next time, and don’t ever hide from me, Ella, or next time you will be bared and then punished. You wouldn’t want my friends to see you like that, now, would you?”

He actually waits for my answer, so I hurry up and give it, “N-No, I don’t.”

“Yeah, well, we will see about that. Go home and clean yourself up. You look pathetic.”

I’m finally left alone to gather myself together. Moving over to the big sink where the students wash their hands after handling art supplies, I look at myself in the mirror above it, and gasp. I look horrific! Bending over, I quickly wash all the makeup from my face, removing all evidence that Jace made me cry.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Thank God I don’t have to drive my sister and brother home today, because I don’t know if I can keep it together being around anyone right now. As I pull into our driveway, I see Jace climbing out of his new jeep that he got for his eighteenth birthday. He smirks at me and then pushes the finger he used on me into his mouth and started sucking on it. I turn and run up the walkway, and into my house. I don’t stop running until I get to my room, slamming the door closed. I lean against it, panting as I catch my breath, but running all the way up here isn’t the only reason why I’m panting. Jace Palmer is what has me trying to get my heart rate down.

What he did to me in that empty classroom was humiliating and shameful, but deep down, I liked it. I liked it even more when his hands rubbed the gel into my heated skin that he caused with his own hand. To make matters worse, his finger almost had me coming all over! He never would have let me live that down. I’m already worried what he will tell tweedle dee and tweedle dum about what happened after they left the room.

Damn him! Why does he have this effect on me? I never had feelings for him until after he started bullying me. I have been crushing on my bully for two years, and now, he’s just made it worse. Knowing what his hands feel like when they touch my bare skin, will be burned into my soul forever. What did I ever do to deserve this, and why did he keep calling me slutty? He knew I was still a virgin when we were still friends, and then he went and scared everybody away, so even if I wanted to, there is no one in my age group that I could have lost it to.

I’m so frustrated! I wish I had someone to talk to, it would be so nice to be able to talk to my two best friends, but he even scared them off! I mean, they don’t hate and treat me badly like everyone else, if anything they pity me. I can see it in their eyes every time we cross paths, but they are unwilling to anger Jace by talking to me. I don’t understand how he can make a whole school scared of him.

Sighing, I head to my bathroom ensuite as I start pulling off my clothes. A bath is what I need right now; a bath and some music, because thanks to the bully next door, I have something that needs attention. I’m just about to step into the tub when I hear my phone ping with a text message. I go back to my room and grab my cell from the bed where I tossed it when I came in. My heart skips a beat when a name that I haven’t seen in two years, pops up. I open the text and read it, furrowing my brows.

JP: Do Not Touch Yourself!

Another text pops up.

JP: I mean it, Ella! If you touch that pussy, YOU WILL BE PUNISHED!

“What the hell?” I say to myself. I happen to glance up, and there is Jace, standing at his bedroom window, staring straight into mine with an anguished look on his face. It takes me a moment, but then I realize that I’m standing here, completely naked. “OH MY GOD!!” Ripping the comforter off my bed, I wrap it around myself and then stalk over to the window and pull my curtains closed.

Sweet Jesus! I can’t believe he saw me naked! He’s never going to let me live it down, and he will make me the laughingstock at school! Slamming my bathroom door, I drop my comforter and climb into the steaming water. I lower myself slowly, not wanting to hurt my bottom any more than it already is. Once I’m all the way in, I sigh. The heat from the water relaxes my body as I close my eyes and my thoughts automatically take me back to the classroom, and the spanking that Jace delivered.

“Well, if anything, he is a man of his word.” I say out loud.

My thoughts are beginning to make my body react, and the last thing I need is for Jace to find out that I did what he commanded me not to do. I don’t think I can handle another punishment so soon after this first one, but where does he get off telling me what I can and can’t do? He doesn’t even like me, so what does it matter? Screw this, it is my body, and I am in charge of what I do to it! With that being said, I slowly start sliding my hand over my thigh, moving it up to where I’m desperately needing it. Just when I’m about to slide it between my thighs, a voice enters my head, his voice.

“UGH!” Frustrated, I pull my hand away and pull myself up and out of the tub. I now need to find something to occupy my time. “Chicken shit,” I mumble to myself as I dry my body off. Forgetting about my sore bottom, I run the towel over it roughly, cursing as the burn comes back full force. Yep, definitely made the right decision.

# Chapter 5 Our Little Secret - Pt. 1

Over the last couple of weeks, things have been back to normal, well my normal anyway. Jace is back to shoving me against lockers as he walks by or trying to trip me when he passes me in the halls. His two friends shoulder bump me, but that’s the extent to what they do to me; the rest is all Jace.

I’m standing at my locker with the door open, reading a text from my mom, when suddenly the door slams shut. It startles me, and I jump back. Kaylee is leaning against the locker next to mine with her arms crossed and a huge smirk on her face. I roll my eyes and go to reopen my locker, but she stops me by slamming her hand against my door.

I sigh heavily, “What do you want, Kaylee?”

“A little respect, for one!” she glares at me.

“I haven’t done anything to you. Believe me, I try to avoid you like the plague.” I say smugly.

“See! That right there…it’s disrespectful!” She points her long, pointed fingernail at me.

“You have to earn respect, Kaylee. You lost my respect when you decided to start treating me like crap for no reason.” I’m just so tired of being scared about who will do what to me. I need to start standing up for myself, “So, again, what do you want? I have a class to get to.”

She huffs, and then gets right up in my face, “Talk to me like that again, and see where that gets you!”

I don’t have time for this, so I put on the biggest fake smile for her, “Geesh, I’m so sorry, Kaylee. To what do I owe the pleasure?”

She gives me a squinty glare at my sarcasm, “I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of Jace throwing a party at his house tomorrow night, and that you are not invited.”

“What makes you think that I would even want to go to one of his parties?”

“Well, I just know how both your parents are close friends and they will probably expect you to go.” She copies my stance.

“Whatever, no worries. I definitely will not be there.” I decide to walk away before I get even more annoyed with the barbie wanna be. I hear her snicker as I pass her, but she doesn’t stop me. Why would she even think that I would expect to be invited?

“Hey, Ella…wait up!” My sister calls out as she jogs up to me, “What class do you have next?”

“History, why do you ask?”

“Oh, just wondering. Are you doing anything this afternoon?”

“Not as of right now, unless mom asks, why?”

“Well, I was wondering if you could take me to the mall and help me pick an outfit out.”

“Of course, I will! I love shopping with you.” I bring her in for a side hug as we walk down the hall.

“Thank you! I better get going, my class is all the way downstairs.” She chuckles.

I shake my head in amusement as my sister bounces away.

“Your little sister is turning into a hottie.” My body freezes at the sound of his voice. Spinning around, I come face to face with my bully.

“Please stay away from her.” I plead.

His hand presses against the middle of his chest, and he gives a fake gasp, “You hurt my feelings, Ella. I would never do anything to hurt an innocent girl like Elise.” He leans in, so the other students passing by don’t hear what he’s about to say, “She isn’t you. I’d never do to her all the things I want to do to you. I wouldn’t want to hurt her like I want to hurt you.”

Even though his words are hurtful, they send a tingle through me, making my core throb. I suck in a breath and take a little step back. When I glance up at his face, there is a look that has replaced the hardness that is usually there. Almost like a look that promises me that he will be doing exactly what he just said. We are only a few inches away from each other, the smell of his cologne tickles my nose. I know the scent well, because it’s still the same one that he started wearing when we were friends. It’s the one that I bought him; he’s never changed it after all this time.

I don’t dare say anything or try to move away. I wait for him to depart first, and when he gives me a sneer and stomps away, I blow the breath out that I hadn’t realized I was holding in.",1,1753768696.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False
1mc3mhj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1mc3mhj/i_wanted_to_share_my_story_and_also_tell_me_what/,I wanted to share my story and also tell me what do u see,"This is the first real romantic relationship I’ve ever experienced, and I’m not sharing it to brag — far from it. It was painful, a harsh slap to the face, but at least it happened early in my life, and that’s a good thing. Some people spend years before going through something like this.

Okay, let’s begin.

I developed feelings for a girl at my university. She worked there — she’s a bit older than me, but only by a few months. She helped me during my final year. She’s kind, beautiful, and super friendly with everyone — very extroverted. That can be both a blessing and a curse.

Now, normally I’m not the type to get involved with girls or chase after them. I always stayed away from that stuff. But sometimes, a certain girl comes into your mind and heart, and any guy who has felt this knows how emotions can destroy everything. For two weeks straight, I couldn’t think about anything but her.

Eventually, we got to know each other more. We followed each other on Instagram, chatted, and exchanged memes. I was naive — I genuinely thought she felt the same way. I later realized I was wrong. But back then, everything felt perfect.

Let me pause the story here and explain something about her. She’s very open-minded, from an upper-class background. She mostly speaks English because she went to an international school. That wasn’t an issue for me. She liked dark/racist humor memes, swore in English, and was super casual — and again, I was totally fine with all of that.

But the downside? She wouldn’t reply right away. Sometimes she’d disappear for a while, and it bothered me how she didn’t see a problem riding alone in an Uber with a guy. (Please don’t judge me too quickly — just hear me out and try to understand my feelings.)

Anyway, I finally got the courage to confess my feelings. I was tired of hiding it. If she accepted, great. If not, I was ready to move on. I told her I loved her.

She said okay — but after I graduate. She also said I’m not in the friendzone and gave some mixed signals. But overall, I was happy and hopeful.

We kept talking on WhatsApp for a few days, then went back to Instagram. One day, I noticed she changed her profile picture, so I messaged her. I thought she would respond, especially since she said she had feelings too. But she didn’t reply at all or even react. Then four days later, she posted a story — so she clearly saw my message. I got frustrated and ignored her for two full weeks.

During that time, we had just finished a project discussion for a course. I posted a story with my friends, and I hadn’t been watching her stories or reacting at all. Out of nowhere, she liked my story and messaged me the next day, sending memes. She said, “I would’ve sent you more if I knew you weren’t busy.”
(I know you’re probably thinking, “What a fool,” but stay with me.)

I ignored her messages for three days. Then I finally replied — but calmly and distant.

Here’s something odd: she posted a story, deleted it, then reposted the same thing the next day and deleted it again. Then after messaging me, she added me to her “close friends” and posted that same story again — but deleted it 10 minutes later. I didn’t understand what that meant, and when I asked, she vaguely said it was just pointing at something, but I didn’t ask again.

We got back to talking. Things felt normal again. Then came a shocking moment — her dad passed away. May he rest in peace. I offered my condolences, of course. Later, she messaged me asking to meet up for coffee, to help her forget and distract herself.

We had a great day together — cinema, coffee, talking.

We ended up going out four times. She invited me once, I invited her once, we exchanged gifts — everything seemed fine.

Then I confessed again. I told her seriously that I loved her. She said, “Okay, give me 3 days and I’ll let you know — but only if you’re not talking to other girls or seeing me as a second option.”

Three days later, she said “okay” and confirmed her feelings. But still, whenever we went out, she’d say things like, “I don’t know how I feel toward you yet — maybe I need more time with you to figure it out.”

She would get jealous, hold my hand, rest her head on my chest or shoulder, but the words she used still sounded like we were “just friends.”

The last time we went out, everything seemed normal and fine. The day after that, still okay. The following day, I sent her a meme — and boom, she blocked me.

I was shocked.

I checked her bio — she had removed it. What the hell? She always said she was honest and didn’t ghost or block people. She said she doesn’t treat people like second options.

She hadn’t blocked me on Instagram, though. I waited a day. Then the next day, I tried calling her — no answer. I kept trying, nothing. By the end of that day, I sent her 3 Instagram messages saying basically:

“If silence is your answer, then forget about the relationship.”

The next day, she called me. Said two words. Then the call cut off from her end. I tried calling back many times. Nothing. I felt like I had the right to know why. What did I do wrong? I’m not someone who likes drama.

Then she blocked all calls from me.

I messaged her from another number, saying it’s me, just wanting to understand. Then she unfollowed me on Instagram.

At that point, you can say whatever you want about me — but I felt crushed. My dignity felt dragged through the dirt.

I honestly thought she was different from the others. Thought she was mature. But turns out, she was just a kid — even more immature than the rest.

I know I lowered myself. But I had the right to ask why. I feel broken, guilty, even stupid for being in this relationship in the first place. There were so many red flags. But any guy knows how emotions can cloud your mind.

Anyway, thank God — I got the slap early. I still have the army ahead, work, and life. Yes, I’m sad. But I’m better off than others. And honestly, screw it — the most important thing I’ve learned is this:

Focus on yourself. No one’s going to be there for you like you will.

I realized that at this age, people can seem like they love you like crazy. But inside them? They’re filled with doubts.
So work on yourself — it’s the better investment.



Btw she stold me about her 2 exes she said she never had official relationship with them before but she blocked one of them and the other ghosted her ....

Edit: btw i tried to talk about girls in some place then she showed jealous idk if she were acting but she was playful jealousy",1,1753768632.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Then after messaging me, she added me to her “close friends” and posted that same story again — but deleted it 10 minutes later. I didn’t understand what that meant, and when I asked, she vaguely said it was just pointing at something, but I didn’t ask again.

We got back to talking. Things felt normal again. Then came a shocking moment — her dad passed away. May he rest in peace. I offered my condolences, of course. Later, she messaged me asking to meet up for coffee, to help her forget and distract herself.

We had a great day together — cinema, coffee, talking.

We ended up going out four times. She invited me once, I invited her once, we exchanged gifts — everything seemed fine.

Then I confessed again. I told her seriously that I loved her. She said, “Okay, give me 3 days and I’ll let you know — but only if you’re not talking to other girls or seeing me as a second option.”

Three days later, she said “okay” and confirmed her feelings. But still, whenever we went out, she’d say things like, “I don’t know how I feel toward you yet — maybe I need more time with you to figure it out.”

She would get jealous, hold my hand, rest her head on my chest or shoulder, but the words she used still sounded like we were “just friends.”

The last time we went out, everything seemed normal and fine. The day after that, still okay. The following day, I sent her a meme — and boom, she blocked me.

I was shocked.

I checked her bio — she had removed it. What the hell? She always said she was honest and didn’t ghost or block people. She said she doesn’t treat people like second options.

She hadn’t blocked me on Instagram, though. I waited a day. Then the next day, I tried calling her — no answer. I kept trying, nothing. By the end of that day, I sent her 3 Instagram messages saying basically:

“If silence is your answer, then forget about the relationship.”

The next day, she called me. Said two words. Then the call cut off from her end. I tried calling back many times. Nothing. I felt like I had the right to know why. What did I do wrong? I’m not someone who likes drama.

Then she blocked all calls from me.

I messaged her from another number, saying it’s me, just wanting to understand. Then she unfollowed me on Instagram.

At that point, you can say whatever you want about me — but I felt crushed. My dignity felt dragged through the dirt.

I honestly thought she was different from the others. Thought she was mature. But turns out, she was just a kid — even more immature than the rest.

I know I lowered myself. But I had the right to ask why. I feel broken, guilty, even stupid for being in this relationship in the first place. There were so many red flags. But any guy knows how emotions can cloud your mind.

Anyway, thank God — I got the slap early. I still have the army ahead, work, and life. Yes, I’m sad. But I’m better off than others. And honestly, screw it — the most important thing I’ve learned is this:

Focus on yourself. No one’s going to be there for you like you will.

I realized that at this age, people can seem like they love you like crazy. But inside them? They’re filled with doubts.
So work on yourself — it’s the better investment.



Btw she stold me about her 2 exes she said she never had official relationship with them before but she blocked one of them and the other ghosted her ....

Christiana’s POV.

The door to the lawyer's office closed behind me with a soft click. I had barely taken a step inside when the man behind the desk looked up from his papers, his expression serious and firm.

""Mrs. Davis, please take a seat. Your husband will join us shortly, but there are matters we need to discuss first,"" he said, gesturing to a chair in front of his imposing mahogany desk.

Curiosity ate at me as I settled into the chair. What could possibly be so urgent that Alex had summoned me here, to a lawyer’s office of all places? I watched the lawyer intently, waiting for him to continue.

He adjusted his glasses and cleared his throat. ""Mrs. Davis, your husband, Alex, has proposed a divorce.""

My breath caught in my throat, and I stared at him, stunned. ""Good heavens, a divorce?"" I managed to say, my voice was shaky.

The lawyer nodded, his face was of professional detachment. ""I know this comes as a surprise to you, but that's what Alex wants.""

I could feel my heart pounding in my chest, each beat was of shock and disbelief that coursed through me. Divorce? Alex and I had our problems, sure, but I never imagined it would come to this.

The lawyer continued, detailing Alex's grievances like he was reading from a script. ""He has cited several reasons for this decision. Firstly, he feels there is a disconnection in your communication. He also mentioned disagreements on financial matters and the future direction of your lives together.""

My mind was racing, struggling to process his words. Alex and I had our spats, but were they really enough to end our marriage?

""And finally,"" the lawyer said, looking up to meet my eyes, ""he mentioned the issue of children. You have been unable to conceive after two years of marriage. Alex is a man of considerable wealth, a billionaire, and he desires heirs to continue his legacy.""

A sharp pain pierced my chest, and tears stung my eyes. The lawyer's words felt like daggers, each one driving deeper into my heart. That Alex could sit here and tell this man such intimate, painful details about our lives… It was almost too much to bear.

My hands trembled as I clasped them in my lap. I felt utterly betrayed, hurt beyond measure. The man I loved, the man I thought I knew, had laid bare our most private struggles and used them as reasons to end our marriage.

The lawyer paused, allowing the weight of his words to sink in. I struggled to compose myself, to fight back the tears that threatened to spill over. I couldn't believe it had come to this—my own husband, my Alex, seeking to end our life together because of something as tragic and uncontrollable as infertility.

I sat there, unable to speak, my mind racing with a thousand thoughts and emotions. The future I had envisioned, the love I thought was unbreakable, was crumbling before my eyes. How could he do this to me? To us?

The door to the lawyer's office opened with a quiet creak, and Alex stepped inside. My heart skipped a beat, and I rose from my chair, meeting his gaze with tear-filled eyes.

""A divorce,"" I said, my voice trembling. ""That's what you truly want?""

""Yes,"" Alex replied, his tone devoid of any remorse. He clenched and unclenched his jaw before continuing, ""I can't do it anymore. This whole marriage is suffocating.""

The words hit me like a sledgehammer, and I struggled to remain standing, my heart aching with a pain I had never known. ""There are rumors,"" I began, swallowing hard, ""that you're seeing Bianca Lewis, the celebrity, the fashion icon. Is that true?""

Alex didn't flinch. ""Yes. You and I drifted apart several months ago, although we did get intimate but I was never satisfied. So, I started seeing Bianca, and we've been together for six months. I must say she makes me feel whole.""

It was as if he had punched me in the face. The rumors I had dismissed as baseless were true. Alex had cheated on me. My chest felt like it was about to explode from the overwhelming agony. I had defended him, convinced he would never betray me, but now, hearing it from his own lips, I was shattered.

""How could you do this to me?"" I demanded, my voice breaking. ""I loved you, Alex. I sacrificed everything to be with you. And now you want to leave me?""

Alex's expression remained cold, almost indifferent. ""Don't even think about begging me because once a man has made up his mind, nothing else can change it.""

His words were like daggers, each one slicing deeper into my already wounded heart. The man I thought I knew, the man I had devoted my life to, stood before me as a stranger. The future I had dreamed of was slipping away, replaced by a painful reality I was unprepared to face.

I felt an overwhelming sense of loss and betrayal. This was not how it was supposed to be. The love that had once bound us now lay in ruins. Destroyed by his desire for a divorce to part ways with me.

The lawyer watched silently, his eyes flicking between us. I could feel the walls closing in, the air growing heavy with the finality of Alex's decision.

I wanted to scream, to lash out, to make him see the depth of the pain he was causing. But all I could do was stand there, my heart breaking into pieces.

I took several deep breaths, trying to steady my raging nerves. The air felt thick with tension, but I forced myself to remain calm. Meeting Alex's gaze with a newfound boldness, I said, ""You want a divorce? Fine. I'll give it to you.""

Turning to the lawyer, I held out my hand. ""Give me the documents.""

The lawyer hesitated for a moment, then handed over the papers. I could feel Alex's eyes on me as I signed each page with a steady hand, willing myself not to break down. I would not give him the satisfaction of seeing me cry.

With the final signature in place, I stood up and walked over to Alex, holding the signed documents out to him. ""I've given you what you want.""

Alex took the papers, his expression unreadable. ""You can have the mansion,"" he said after a moment. ""And Davis Enterprises, along with the estate in the Hamptons. Plus, $50 million as compensation for all your suffering throughout the years.""

The words hung in the air, a list of material possessions meant to ease the pain of a broken heart. But they meant nothing to me now.

""I don't want any of it,"" I said, my voice steady and clear. ""Keep your money, your properties, your company. They won't heal the hurt you've caused.""

# 2: Pain

As I approached our home, my heart sank at the sight of my belongings scattered outside. My clothes, shoes, and personal items were piled haphazardly on the lawn. My stomach churned as I saw Alex's mother, Margret , standing on the porch, ordering the maids and butlers to throw my things out.

Margret never liked me. She always found ways to belittle me and poison Alex against me. Seeing her now, orchestrating my public humiliation, was almost too much to bear.

""Why are you doing this?"" I demanded, stepping forward, my voice shaking with a mix of anger and despair.

Margret's eyes flashed with contempt. Before I could react, she slapped me hard across the cheek. The sting was sharp and immediate, but what hurt more was the malice in her eyes. ""You dare talk? After everything you've put my son through?""

I chuckled bitterly, even as tears filled my eyes. ""I stood by Alex. I defended him, supported him through everything. You know nothing about what we've been through.""

Margret sneered, her voice dripping with disdain. ""Take your things and get the hell out. Barren woman, who knows nothing other than squandering my son's money. Alex already divorced you and he's bringing in someone better.""

The words were like knives, each one cutting deeper than the last. But I forced myself to smile through the tears. ""It's what you've always wanted, isn't it?""

Margret 's face twisted with rage. ""You ungrateful little wretch. You were never good enough for my son. You're a failure as a wife, and you couldn't even give him a child. Now he's found someone worthy of him, someone who isn't a useless drain on his fortune.""

The maids and butlers watched in silence, their eyes filled with pity and discomfort. Margret continued to berate me, each insult cutting deeper than the last. “You think you’re something special? You’re nothing! My son deserves someone who can give him a real family, not a useless woman like you.”

Her harsh words hit me ever harder, with the eyes of the servants on us, witnessing my humiliation. 

""You're a disgrace, Christiana. A parasite who latched onto my son's success. You have no place here. Get out and never come back.""

I stood there, absorbing every harsh word, every insult, but refusing to let her see me break. I knew this was her moment of triumph, the culmination of years of disdain and bitterness. And in that moment, I realized I had to walk away with my head held high, for myself and for the life growing inside me.

“I’m leaving,” I said quietly, gathering what little dignity I had left. “But know this, Margaret. I loved your son with all my heart, and I sacrificed everything for him. One day, he’ll realize the mistake he made. And when that day comes, I hope you can live with yourself.”

With that, I turned and began collecting my things, tears streaming down my face but my mind was already made up. I would rebuild my life, far away from this toxic one.

Margaret's harsh words echoed in my mind, but I couldn't dwell on them. I needed to find a place for my things and figure out my next move. I pulled out my phone and began calling people I thought I could rely on.

""Hi, it's Christiana. I need a place to store some of my things temporarily. Could you help me out?"" I asked, my voice trembling slightly.

There was a pause on the other end before the voice responded, ""I'm really sorry, Christiana, but I can't help you right now. It's... it's complicated.""

My heart sank, but I tried to stay hopeful. I made another call. ""Hey, it's Christiana. I’m in a bit of a situation. Can I bring some of my stuff over?""

""Christiana, I heard about what happened. I don’t think it's a good idea. I’m sorry,"" the response came, tinged with discomfort.

Each call ended the same way, and the realization hit me hard: Alex had already been around, telling everyone his version of the story. In their eyes, I was the villain. No one wanted to help me. 

I tried to access my bank account, hoping to at least get a hotel room for the night. But when I swiped my card at an ATM, the screen flashed, “Transaction declined.” I tried again, and the same message appeared. Panic rising, I logged into my account on my phone, only to see a message: “Account frozen.”

“No, no, no,” I whispered, my hands shaking. Alex had frozen my accounts. He had access to them and now, he had taken everything. I was in pain, with absolutely nothing left. My heart felt like it was being squeezed in a vice. I had no money, no home, and no one to turn to.

As night fell, I wandered aimlessly through the streets, clutching my bags and hoping to find somewhere safe. The city lights blurred through my tears, and the cold air bit at my skin. I felt utterly lost, each step heavier than the last.

Suddenly, I felt a rough hand grab my arm. “Hey! What’s going on?” I cried out, but another hand yanked my bags away. Panic surged through me as I saw two men running off with everything I had left.

“No! Please, stop! Help!” I screamed, but my cries echoed unanswered through the empty streets. The men disappeared into the night, leaving me with nothing but my purse and phone.

I collapsed onto the pavement, sobbing uncontrollably. My entire world had crumbled, and I was left alone in the darkness. I felt utterly broken, my spirit crushed by the weight of my circumstances.

With trembling hands, I fumbled for my phone in my purse. It was the only lifeline I had left, the only connection to the world outside this nightmare. Through tear-blurred vision, I dialed a number, praying for someone, anyone, t

o answer and offer a tad of hope in this dark hour.

# 3: Pregnant? Incredulous!

Two weeks had passed since my world had crumbled to dust. My days were now spent scrubbing floors and sweeping at a dingy restaurant, the smell of grease and old food clinging to my clothes. 

My boss, a perpetually sour-faced woman named Karen, took every opportunity to remind me of my fall from grace. We were only two waiters and one was on leave.

""Christiana, get over here and clean this mess!"" Karen barked, pointing to a spill near the kitchen. ""And hurry up! Table three is waiting for their drinks!""

The restaurant was overwhelming, with rowdy customers demanding my attention. I rushed from table to table, my hands red and raw from constant cleaning, trying to keep up with the never-ending stream of orders and complaints.

""Miss! Where's my coffee?"" a gruff man called out, waving his hand impatiently. ""And bring some more napkins while you're at it!""

As I hurried to fulfill the customers' requests, the sound of the television caught my ear. The news anchor's voice cut through the chaos, and my heart sank as I recognized the topic of discussion.

""In today's celebrity news, billionaire Alex Davis has finalized his divorce from his wife Christiana Davis and is now officially with fashion icon Bianca.""

I froze, the tray in my hands trembling. On the screen, images and videos of Alex and Bianca flashed by, the two of them looking every bit the perfect couple. They smiled for the cameras, their hands entwined, their eyes filled with a happiness that felt like a knife twisting in my heart.

The customers around me began to chatter, their voices blending into a cacophony of judgment and gossip.

""Did you hear about Alex Davis? Finally got rid of that wife of his,"" one man said with a laugh. ""Can't blame him, though. She couldn't even give him a kid.""

""Yeah, I heard she was pretty useless,"" another woman chimed in. ""Bianca is a much better match for him. She's gorgeous and successful.""

My face burned with humiliation and pain as I listened to their cruel words. They didn't know they were talking about me, the woman who was serving them. Each comment was like a dagger, cutting deeper into my already shattered heart.

""I feel bad for that ex-wife of his,"" a lone voice spoke up. I turned to see a middle-aged woman shaking her head. ""Imagine how she must feel, seeing her husband move on so quickly. It’s just so sad.""

Karen's shrill voice snapped me back to reality. ""Christiana, stop dawdling and get back to work! Those tables won't serve themselves!""

I swallowed the lump in my throat and forced myself to keep moving. As I continued to serve the oblivious customers, their words echoed in my mind, each one a reminder of my perceived failures and the life I had lost.

The image of Alex and Bianca haunted me, their smiles mocking my misery. How had things gone so wrong? How could the man I had loved so deeply, sacrificed so much for, move on so easily? 

Oh, I almost forgot. She had always been there.

The pain was almost unbearable, but I held myself together, refusing to let them see me break. 

As the night wore on, the news segment continued, detailing the glamorous life Alex and Bianca were now living. I scrubbed the floors harder, trying to erase the hurt with every stroke of the brush. But no amount of scrubbing could cleanse the ache in my heart.

By the time my shift ended, I was exhausted, both physically and emotionally. I sank into a chair in the back of the restaurant, the weight of the day pressing down on me. Tears welled up in my eyes, but I blinked them back. I couldn't afford to cry. Not here, not now.

Instead, I took a deep breath and stared at my reflection in the dirty window. I was stronger than this.

No one had come to my aid when I needed it most. Friends turned their backs, and even those I thought I could rely on had chosen sides, believing the lies Alex spread about me. It was Karen, the hot-tempered owner of the small restaurant, who took pity on me. She offered me food and shelter in exchange for my work.

Scrubbing floors and serving unruly customers was a far cry from the life I had known. Each day was a struggle to hold onto my dignity while performing menial tasks, enduring Karen's never-ending criticism, and facing the pitying or judgmental glances of those who had heard the news when they by chance ran into me.

…

One afternoon, after enduring another grueling shift, I found myself staring into the bathroom mirror, my reflection a ghost of the woman I once was. 

My eyes, red and puffy from lack of sleep and constant tears, stared back at me. Suddenly, a wave of nausea hit me hard, and I barely made it to the toilet before retching violently. My body trembled, and I felt weak and lightheaded as I sat on the cold tile floor, trying to regain my composure.

Two hours later, I found myself in a sterile doctor's office, the harsh fluorescent lights making everything seem even more surreal. Dr. Patel, a kindly older man with a gentle demeanor, had just returned with the results of my blood test. 

""Ms. Christiana,"" he began, his voice calm but serious, ""you're pregnant.""

The words hung in the air, almost incomprehensible. ""Pregnant?"" I echoed, my voice barely more than a whisper. ""How... how can that be? I was told I couldn't have children.""

Dr. Patel gave me a sympathetic look. ""Sometimes, the body can surprise us. But I assure you, the test is accurate. You're approximately three weeks along.""

I shook my head, struggling to process the information. ""No, there must be some mistake. I was told I was barren. This can't be right."" My hands trembled as I clutched at the chair's armrests, trying to anchor myself in this revelation.

He handed me the test results, the undeniable proof staring up at me in black and white. I traced the words with my finger, still in shock. Pregnant. How could this be?

""You're sure?"" I asked again, my voice breaking. 

Dr. Patel nodded, his expression gentle but firm. ""I'm certain, Ms. Christiana. Congratulations.""

Congratulations? The word felt foreign, almost mocking. I was at a loss for words. Pregnant with Alex's child. The last time we had been intimate was ten days before the divorce. It hadn't been an act of passion or love; it had felt more like a duty to him. He didn't hold me lovingly, didn't kiss me. His mind had clearly been elsewhere. And now, despite everything, I was pregnant?

I left the doctor's office in a daze, the world around me feeling distant and unreal. The irony of the situation was overwhelming. 

Alex had divorced me because I couldn't give him children, and now, he

re I was, carrying his child. The universe had a cruel sense of humor.

# 4: Meeting Again

The plane's engines hummed softly as I settled into my first-class seat, looking out the window at the clouds. 

Five years had passed since I left this city, heartbroken and destitute. Now, I was returning as a successful businesswoman, the CEO of a thriving empire known nationwide. My brands, ranging from high-end fashion to eco-friendly cosmetics, were household names. The transformation felt surreal.

My personal assistant, Grace, was busy typing away on her laptop a few seats down. Beside her, my security team ensured that everything was in order. They were all part of the group that had become essential in my new life. My success had brought wealth, influence, and an entirely new set of responsibilities.

Among my group, however, the most important were my children. Ethan and Emma, my five-year-old twins, were currently engaged in a heated debate, their voices carrying through the luxurious cabin. They approached me, their faces filled with the intensity of their argument.

""Mom, tell Emma she's wrong!"" Ethan demanded, his blue eyes sparkling with frustration and excitement.

""No, Mom, Ethan is wrong!"" Emma retorted, her hands on her hips and a stubborn pout on her lips.

I couldn't help but smile at their antics. They were both so smart and full of life, each with their own unique personality. Ethan was logical and methodical, while Emma was creative and fiercely independent.

""Okay, okay, calm down,"" I said, holding up my hands. ""What's the argument about this time?""

""Ethan says that the capital of Australia is Canberra, but I said it's Sydney,"" Emma explained, her eyes wide with determination.

I chuckled softly. ""Ethan is right, sweetheart. The capital of Australia is Canberra, not Sydney.""

Emma's face fell, her pout deepening. ""But Sydney is the biggest city. It should be the capital.""

I pulled her close, kissing the top of her head. ""Sometimes the biggest city isn't the capital. It's a bit confusing, but it's a good thing to learn.""

Ethan beamed with pride, while Emma sulked for a moment before finally giving in with a sigh. ""Okay, Ethan, you win.""

""Thanks, Mom,"" Ethan said, giving me a quick hug before running back to his seat, victorious.

Emma lingered, her disappointment still evident. I cupped her cheek, looking into her eyes. ""You know, you were right about Sydney being the biggest city. That's something special too.""

She smiled up at me, her earlier defeat forgotten. ""Thanks, Mom.""

As she scampered back to her seat, I leaned back and took a deep breath. Moments like these reminded me of how far we had come. From the depths of despair to the heights of success, my children were my greatest achievement and my most precious treasure.

Returning to the city I had left behind felt like closing a chapter and beginning a new one. My heart swelled with pride and anticipation. This time, I was not the broken woman who had walked away with nothing. I had everything which made my life whole.

Five years ago, my world had turned upside down. Discovering I was pregnant after Alex left me was both a blessing and a challenge. With no family to turn to—being an orphan meant I was truly alone—I had to muster every ounce of strength I had left.

I saved up what little money I earned from scrubbing floors and sweeping at Karen's restaurant. It was tough work, but Karen's kindness and the roof over my head kept me going. Every night, I counted my savings, dreaming of a better life for my unborn children. I knew staying there was not an option; I needed a fresh start, away from the pain and humiliation of the past.

With enough money saved, I left Karen’s place and moved to a new city, far from the memories that haunted me. I found a small, rundown apartment and started from scratch. My first venture was a tiny boutique—barely more than a closet—where I sold handmade dresses and accessories. The work was grueling, and the profits were meager, but I poured my heart into it.

Pregnancy was no walk in the park, especially without anyone to lean on. I faced the morning sickness, the doctor visits, and the overwhelming fear of the unknown alone. But every kick, every flutter from my babies gave me the strength to keep going. When the time came, I gave birth to Ethan and Emma. They were my miracles, my reason for fighting harder than ever before.

Raising twins on my own was a monumental task. Sleepless nights, endless feedings, and the constant juggle between motherhood and building a business tested me in ways I never imagined. But giving up was never an option. I wanted to prove to myself and to the world that I could rise above the challenges.

The boutique grew slowly but steadily. Word of mouth spread, and soon, my unique designs caught the eye of a few influential people. Orders started pouring in, and I reinvested every penny into expanding my business. I moved into a bigger space, hired staff, and launched my brand nationwide. The trials were many, but so were the triumphs.

Ethan and Emma grew up in the midst of it all, always understanding that their mother was working to create a better life for them. They were my greatest cheerleaders, their laughter and love my daily inspiration.

Now, as I sat on that flight back to the city I had left in shambles, I couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of pride. I had built an empire from nothing. My brands were synonymous with elegance and innovation, and I had secured a future for my children that I had once only dreamed of.

…

The flight finally landed, and the hum of activity around us grew louder as we prepared to disembark. I straightened my jacket and turned to my team, giving them last-minute instructions.

""Grace, make sure the car service knows we’re on our way. Sam, coordinate with the hotel about our late check-in. Lisa, double-check the kids' bags,"" I said, my voice clear and authoritative.

My personal maid, Lisa, nodded and moved to check Ethan and Emma's bags. The children, bubbling with excitement, were being particularly giggly and playful. Ethan kept trying to tickle Emma, who squealed in delight, her laughter ringing through the cabin.

As we moved through the airport, I kept an eye on them, smiling at their antics. They were truly the light of my life, their joy infectious even in the midst of a hectic schedule. We made our way to the waiting area where our cars were supposed to be, my team forming a protective circle around us.

""Mommy, look! I'm a superhero!"" Ethan shouted, darting ahead with his arms outstretched like an airplane. Emma, not to be outdone, tried to catch up, her little legs pumping furiously.

""Ethan, slow down!"" I called out, but it was too late. In his enthusiasm, Ethan collided with a man surrounded by his own group of P.A.s and bodyguards.

The man looked down at Ethan, who stared up at him with wide eyes, momentarily speechless. I hurried over, my heart racing.

""I'm so sorry,"" I began, but my words trailed off as the man removed his sunglasses and called my name.

I used to read a lot as a kid, but I rarely do now; though when I do read, I will absolutely tear through a book in a week and change, and be left hungry for more. Like last year, when I devoured Stieg Larsson's *Millenium* trilogy (*TGWTDT*) in about 2 weeks after not having read any other books that year.   
  
I'd like to read more often, so I figure should start by reading stuff I know I love <3 And I've learned over the years that I really, *really* love investigative mystery thrillers. *Especially* ones that star journalists, or have a ""journalistic"" perspective (for example, the films *Spotlight* and *All the President's Men*).  
  
I get so sucked in by stories that find depth in the mundane details. When done right you can almost physically feel the richness and history of the world through the page. It's a texture; the texture of photographs, notepads, and newspaper clippings. It's the taste of coffee, and sandwiches, and the hum of fluorescent lights. I love watching a group of people come together like clockwork to follow a paper trail, digging through filing cabinets, chasing down witness testimony. Both *TGWTDT* and *Spotlight* do this so well. It's such a rush, that feeling of piecing together how things work, and why- and you can tell the characters feel it too; that need not just to *know*, but to *understand.* And if it all pays off in the end, and the protagonist can right some horrible wrong.... god damn is it satisfying.

So... any suggestions of where to go next? I'd prefer to stick to grounded, real-world fiction for now, nothing supernatural/fantasy yet (although I am interested if there's books like that for later). Also preferably modern stories, like at least 70s-now. Crime novels, murder mysteries, political thrillers... hell, courtroom novels even, if they exist.

PROLOGUE : Bio Corp 

Bio corp, a multi-million dollar recycling company has launched a new and mysterious attraction Called ""One ticket to heaven"". It has garnered quite the popularity of late, aswell as it caught the attention of one smart but infamous journolist, who's fate is about to change drastically as she will begin to investigate into the dark secrets the company is hiding in plane sight.

CHAPTER 1: Zoey Baker 

It was 6 am in the morning, zoey's alarm went off as usual to wake her up for her daily routine. ""Another shitty day huh zoey ?"" said zoey to herself while slowly getting up from her bed and sitting on its edge. Zoey was a a tall athletic with slightly shallow cheeks, red hair and green eyes. zoey started her routine by going to the shower, brushing her teeth and finally going to make black coffee. ""Ohh thank you god for this black sludge that gives me the energy to exist !"" Says Zoey while taking the cup of coffee and going straight to her working desk, where her old laptop and some notebooks rested. Sip after sip, Zoey scrolled against any news she could, with the hopes that maybe she can find something worthy to investigate and bring her back to the fame she once had before that incident, which ruined her carrier as a world class journolist. As if by fate or some other mircale a pop up ad appeared on zoey's screen which said ""Dear citizens, come visit our house of recycle, and try our new attraction for only two dollars a ticket ! Cheap and simple, come and give yourself to heavens embrace ! All the nessesary information about the activity is located in Bio-Corp inc site."" Well well if this isnt suspicious that i dont know what is. Zoey said while having a small grin appear on her lips. She quickly went on the companies site and called the first number she saw. ""Hello is this bio corp ?"" Said zoey on the phone ""Why yes it is, Mrs Zoey Baker, and you are calling us about our special activity called One Ticket To Heaven i pressume ? Zoey was stunned, not only was she right about zoey's intentions but she knew her full name. ""May i ask how did you know my name ?"" The voice on the line was quick to answer ""Yes we have access to the overall data base of the city so that we will be ready for potentiomal clients in the future"". Her voice was ecstatic just like before, it was creeping zoey out abit but she countinued. ""Can i come and visit your new attraction ? Ohh and before i forget im a journolist so ill be brining a camera with me"" Zoey was ready to be rejected the possibility of bringing her camera but she was surprised once again. ""Oh but Of course Mrs Baker, you can come and film the activity all you want"". ""When can i come then ?"" Said zoey. ""Just for you Mrs Baker we have a V.I.P hour free just for you, because of your contribution to the city"" What she said made Zoey feel uneasy but she took her confused emotion in control and said ""Yes that sounds good ill be there on time"" As she was about the hang up the voice on the line said. ""When you'll come visit the registry and you will be personally guided to our special activity, thats all for now ! good bye, and have a nice day Mrs Baker"".

CHAPTER 2 : One Ticket To Heaven

It was an early after noon, the weather outside was pleasantly cold and foggy, the usual weather for the united kingdoms. Zoey was walking on the streets of london towards the building of Bio corp, she had worn An old light brown leather jacket, with a white top below, also blue ripped jeans with some nice small brown boots. Zoey never leaves her apartment without her trusty camera. Its an old model, far older than what is being sold in the current year, but it still does its job of capturing and recording just perfectly, it fits nicely into her jacket.
She stood there, in front of the entrance to bio corp and felt as if she is being watched from afar, she developed this skill from her years of working as an active journolist, it has become like second nature for her, But it still gives her the creeps knowing so. As she stepped inside she was awed by interior, a large lobby with white and gray color patterns, high classed furniture and cyan lighting and in the middle of it all a circeler table that had the reseptionist in the middle of it. But something felt off for her the whole lobby was empty besides the receptionist, you would think such a bjg company would have people walking about but here it was empty, souless even.",2,1753768141.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I was supposed to go to work and I was so worked up I could not do anything. When you would run off for hours screwing woman sling drugs overdosing all kinds of crap I was wrong for being upset. I hear the most screwed up rumors about you and it’s consistent and crazy and all I am doing is trying to work trying to make good decisions and you can’t listen to one boundary which is leave me alone for a minute call at 6 pm I’ll talk then. We both did nasty things but the torture and lies gave me PTSD and I ask for one thing for you to give me some space and you cannot. Then when I do answer its fight fight fight. You’re going to get out and you’re going to get mad I won’t do what you want and you’ll throw a baby man fit you’ll take off your bracelet GPS will get triggered and boom back where you started.

You’re emotionally not ready to get out your dad is in denial of how bad off you are and you need to be sober I need some space to get sober but you won’t let me. You won’t let me breath you won’t let me think you won’t let me be still or quite. You drive me to hate right along with the real sideways stuff your dad says. All I do is work to be in debit to your jail phone calls and pay off debit you made. I hardly get any money for myself!!!! I but myself a coffee Thats it!!!!! Then I pay people back thats all I do!!! I can’t hold you up emotionally I need support and not from you!!! I need you to check your own guilt your own shame your own hate internally so I can work on me. Why can’t you understand that???? Why can’t you see I am never going to be the same after the physical, emotional, financial and mental abuse you put me through. 

You don’t even really love me. You love that reanimated Amish white eye demon you got pregnant last fall. You’re really sick!!! You are really really really a sick man. You don’t know who you love you don’t know who you want you don’t know at all how to be a husband and I’m done being the one to say it. Ok I’m done! I’m also done with the bullshit games everyone you know plays. You brought crazy people into my life while I brought you education and stability. You made me take care of all the dogs clean the house work two jobs while you went out to drink with your work buddies. You neglected my emotional needs for years and then tell me to just get over it. Well then why don’t you just get over beating on people and lying? I won’t hold my breath. 

You and I are not healthy and you are going to push me right either into jail or into a psych ward because you can’t deal with my rejection. You can’t deal with much and I can’t deal with you! This is in my opinion going to end not well and the fact that no one can see how badly you need to just sit and chill for awhile is a tragedy. You need to be out of the public you need to be getting serious help you need to focus on you so I can do the same for me but I already know you are going to panic constantly and be in a state of pain. Yes you are told by the drug councilor to move on, let go start anew but you are not the victim to you. Healing doesn’t work that way for me. I can only imagine the pain you grew up in to be told to “just get over it” and move on. Your dad said he didn’t have his life together until 40. You were late in your teens by then already in jail already out of control. You are 39 and you are or were looking at serious time. Your dad is delusional thinking you will figure it out right away. He is in denial of your borderline personality disorder, your psychotic episodes, your depression. You are one step away from being a full blown sociopath. He has no clue or is one himself. People say all the children your father raised are criminals and all the children with their mothers turned out alright.

I’m new to Fall River by way of North Carolina, and first, I owe y’all an apology. I think I accidentally brought the heat with me. I swear it didn’t used to follow me like this. 😬

I moved here recently and am looking to build real friendships. Not just passing small talk, but the kind of connection where you can sit on a porch during a storm (thunder or snow!) and just exist together, or take a long walk through the city pointing out old signs, weird architecture, and overgrown places with stories.

I’m into cooking (mostly big, cozy meals meant for sharing), local history, quiet corners of nature, thunderstorms, and urban exploring in that “gently trespassing with reverence” kind of way. I like talking about food memories, weather patterns, forgotten buildings, family stories, all of it.

If you're someone who:

-Gets excited about a storm rolling in

-Stops to admire moss on a stone wall or a building that clearly has a past

-Loves a good meal and maybe wants to swap recipes or hit a farmers’ market

-Enjoys talking about places, people, and things that matter... even (especially) the overlooked stuff

-Wants to find community, not just contacts

Then I’d really love to meet you.

Bonus points if you have a kid (mine is 5yo and he's amazing and a LOT), but not necessary for friendship. 💜

Let’s grab a coffee or a beer or something sometime. My treat if it starts raining or is unseasonably hot, lol 😅

Edit: I am 34F, my family is all here and they're wonderful. My grandparents have a house on the Cape that I love to bring friends to! It's beautiful and on the water. I have a 5yo son, and it's really hard to make friends in your 30s as I've found! Hoping to fare better here than where I lived before.

1mc3dfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mc3dfl/the_road_is_too_quiet/,The Road Is Too Quiet,"    I started at my job around May of this year. It’s a ways a way from where I live so I have a lengthy commute. My first day I was a bit anxious, naturally, so I pulled up some music on my phone before I left. I was humming along, finally less tense, when I turned onto the long stretch of road through the woods that would lead towards the city my work is in. It took me a second to realize that the music had stopped. I waited for the song to end and the inevitable ad to play but it didn’t. I glanced at my phone and saw the connection had cut out. I huffed and dialed up the car radio but that was out too. I wasn’t immediately alarmed, but the silence started to seem more pronounced than the music. Just the sound of the engine and loose change shifting in the cup holder. I watched the trees roll past as I drove. Tall dark ones with fat trunks and gnarly roots holding the reddish soil in place. The ferns were like something out of Jurassic Park. I was very aware of my breathing though. In the absence of sound I had noticed it and couldn’t un-notice the pattern. I could feel the heave of my chest and the way it tugged at my dress shirt that had shrunk in the wash. I could feel the thick collar on the hair on the back of my neck. I felt a little lightheaded, my temples tight.  I wanted to reach for my coffee but my hands didn’t want to leave the wheel. I was staring straight ahead, unwavering. My jaw was clenched. Then the faded road sign came into view with another car driving down the intersecting road, both the radio and my phone clicked on, blaring music as I approached. The tension fell away as fast as it had come on. I realized that was the first car I had seen since I started on that road. I signaled and turned left. Something about this stuck with me, it was just so odd. Perhaps I finally had my first paranormal experience. Not the most riveting story, but something to talk about when life got dull.

    Ive been at my job for some months now. The effects of that road are consistent. Every day too and from work I get that funny feeling until I turn onto the next street. It’s weird, I guess, but I’ve gotten used to it. 

It’s November and I’m eagerly going home to wrap myself in a blanket and fall asleep to the tv. The suns setting as I leave work and as I reach “the road” the last of the sun is hidden somewhere in the mountains. I don’t necessarily believe monsters and ghosts are real, but I’m not willing to find out either. So I’ll be honest, it’s dark out and going down the road I’m a bit jumpy. No other cars are in sight, as per usual, so I turn on my brights. The bad feeling quickly settles in and my foot is heavy on the gas. I notice a shape at the edge of the road as I pass. I say a silent prayer for the poor animal, hoping it was a natural death. A bit further along I note that’s there’s wind tonight as I see the trees moving. I glance up and my heart drops. The tops of the trees are still. I stare ahead. Things are moving in the tree line. I should expect this, of course I would see animals in such a secluded place. But I cant let myself look at them. I start to connect the bad feeling this road gives me to the wildlife. Did my body somehow sense them? I guess the feeling is akin to the one of being watched. I sit with this thought although I knew it makes me feel worse. But I make it home. It’s happening everyday now. When the early mornings are dark, I see it then too. I know it’s only wildlife. But whether it’s my fear or my hope for a mystery, I can’t seem to let myself look.

    I thought having a story to tell would be fun, but with each week things get worse. It’s not fun when you’re living the horror. It’s true dark now when I drive down the road on my way home. Shapes weave in and out of the trees. I still haven’t looked, now it’s because I refuse to. I’m driving about 70mph and there’s movement -like usual- in the corner of my eye. This time though, I see a full silhouette. I can’t stop my eyes flickering towards it. It’s on all fours running, keeping pace with the car. It makes me sick. An animal shouldn’t go that fast. I have the thought that it’s doing it to look at me. A sob escapes me and I force my mouth shut. Tears rush down my face like a child. Only after I exit the road do I notice it’s gone. I make it home. I break down once I pull in the driveway, only finally letting myself cry although I’ve been off that road for a while. I fumble with the keys and lock myself in the house. I logic away the fear, collect myself, and go to bed. But it doesn’t stop. I wake up to hear the overgrown bushes scraping against my window. I jolt up but before I can look it stops. I lay back down and half and hour goes by, I’m still awake. I feel the dread crushing into me. The kind I have only ever felt before on the road. I don’t think I am safe. This is my parents property but I’m going to find an apartment. A second or third floor one I hope. 

    I wasn’t able to find an affordable apartment but I think that was for the best. As scared as I was the next few nights, I made myself stay awake and watch the window. It really was nothing, I got into my own head. Not much has changed in terms of the road, I think it’s better actually. The animals haven’t been running around since, only peaking out here and there. The feeling on the road hasn’t changed, but at least it’s not worse. After having a strange experience I’m glad it’s over, I no longer yearn for a scary story to tell.

    I was wrong. I should have just taken the long way instead, I knew this place was wrong and I ignored my fcking instincts anyways. It’s the dead of winter and I agreed to work overtime last minute for some reason. It’s dark or clouded almost all hours of the day and in the dark is when the activity picks up. I wasn’t planning on coming in today, so I didn’t fill the gas. I went against my instincts for money. I was blinded by the hope that greed permits. I chose to work in the city because of the job opportunities, far from home. I wanted the big life, the busy and important life; it led me here. But I’m doing my best, was it so wrong to want for more myself than the mere scraps my father made over a lifetime of toil? I always disregarded the dark woods in favor of the gleaming lights. I forgot that I am an animal too. It’s dark out and I only have the faint light of my dying phone to see. I’m on that road. I ran out of fuel about half way along, my car is dead. I feel cold, not just from the lack of heating. But I can’t think like that, I’m spiraling. I just need to breathe, I really am okay. I think the stress of work and feeling like a failure caught up to me in the form of this road. The lack of cell service though, is undeniably real. I can’t call anyone so I’m hoping to sleep here and either get help from a passing car or walk to the nearest building. I’m probably going to end up doing the latter.
I move to the backseat and try to use my coat as a pillow, but the bad feeling is closing in on me. I shudder and curl inward. I’ve only just closed my eyes when I hear it. A yowling, screaming call sounds from the trees. It goes on and on and I feel hot tears pouring down my cheeks. I’m taken back to childhood, waking to the sound of coyotes in the field, half-awake mind labeling the noise as a monster. My knees are to my chest. My car is safe, I am safe. Still it feels like an eggshell between me and the outside. I feel frozen. My subconscious tells me to play dead, my curiosity begs me to look. The howls sound like nothing I’ve ever heard. It’s most akin to the cries of an infant crossed with the laugh of a hyena. I don’t feel like a human anymore. I am a prey. I can’t think, I’m only feeling. I am not the highest on the food chain, and I am scared. I am scared. There are big things outside. I see them. They see me. Big and hungry. I am little more than food in a can. I knew it was wrong here, but I didn’t listen to myself. I should have.",1,1753767720.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

As I stated before, I'm writing down my days so I can bring them to my therapist. I started this after my breakdown on the 26th.

Mods, if this posting somehow becomes a problem, please just DM me instead of taking down the posts, I'd appreciate that. 

Now. 

July 28th: I woke up around six, had a glass of milk and headed to Tims; for an apple juice and a double stack farmer's wrap with no egg and no cheese (I don't like how they mix their eggs, and the cheese is disgusting), I got to work around 7:30, and helped Richard (my grandpa) turn on the lights and get things ready for the day. Soon the crew rolled in, two were missing but they had been excused, and one hadn't been there at all. One of my coworkers who is the same age as me brought in coffee for everyone, one for me too, but I politely; declined since I don't drink coffee. Work went as usual despite things being more hectic; due to short staff, but we got the necessary done, got orders shipped, and the usuals. I had changed the insoles; of my steel toe boots and was only facing discomfort; towards the end of the day. After coming home around 6pm (we go till 5pm, a few minutes afterwards if stuff is needed to be talked about and shut the lights off), I got onto Fortnite; to check the shop but there wasn't nothing really good or anything I could afford, so I hoped onto Call of Duty Black Ops 6 and began playing the Grief mode on zombies (survive for as long as possible, sabotage the other team, be the last ones standing) and got a good win streak, the game even thought it was still Double XP; Weekend so I got some small progression in my master prestige. No incidents today, thankfully, as I just stayed in the basement. When I got to my grandparents house, I ate BBQ chips and watched an episode of Dateline (a true crime show) 

This entry is from my notes page, and these will be shared to the therapist in September. 

Hope you like the updates, doing my best to stay positive and push the bad stuff away.

I’ve been trying to build a consistent morning routine for years. Journaling, cold showers, to-do lists — you name it. But nothing threw me off more than one tiny, innocent habit:

Checking email.

I’d open my inbox “just to skim” — and suddenly I’d lose 45 minutes replying, overthinking, jumping tabs, spiraling.  
What started as discipline turned into distraction. And I hated it.

So a few weeks ago, I had this thought:  
**What if I could process email without ever looking at it?**  
No inbox. No keyboard. Just a quick voice interaction while making coffee or heading to the gym.

That’s when I started building **Clarro** — a tool that lets you check, summarize, and even reply to your emails using just your voice and your AirPods.  
No screen. No typing. No distractions.

It’s kind of like a productivity assistant for your ears.  
And honestly… it's the first time I’ve ever cleared my inbox *before breakfast*.

🎯 Why I’m Sharing This Here

I know a lot of you are working hard to build better habits, eliminate distractions, and take back control of your day. That’s the whole reason I started this.

I’m planning to open up **beta testing in the next 1–2 weeks**, and I’d love to:

* Get feedback from this community
* Share early access with people who are chasing structure and momentum like I am

If that sounds interesting, drop a comment — I’ll send you the beta form.

Let’s build better mornings. I am genuinely excited and proud to share this with you guys and I hope it can help you as much as it helped it me.",0,1753767627.0,getdisciplined,1,0.5,False

1mc36vl,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mc36vl/the_elder_sign_part_1/,The Elder Sign - Part 1,"Hi. The boys loved Dagon's Mirror, so I wanted to write something that felt authentically Lovecraftian. This story will be a bit frontloaded, but I hope you enjoy it nonetheless.

To whomever it may concern, 

I wrote this as a recollection of my final adventure. Though it has been many years, I still recall every detail with perfect clarity. 

To give you some background, my name is Harold Carter. I was an explorer throughout the late 19th and early 20th century. A dying breed as it were. Much of Earth has been discovered, conquered and catalogued by this point. Yet I still believed there was something more out there for me.

At this point in my life, I had married, earned my fortune and achieved great renown among my fellow scholars and explorers. A rich, full life at the age of thirty. Yet I yearned for new horizons, just as great Alexander had yearned for Okeanos beyond the seas of sand. What I desired was lost Atlantis.

This notion was well known to the public. Their skepticism of my position was natural. After all, countless others had sought that mysterious civilization and found nothing. I must admit that even I found my yearning to be somewhat fanciful. After all, Atlantis was considered a myth even during the time of Plato. If any evidence of its existence still remained, no man of science had found it yet.

That all changed on the day that I received a letter from a man who called himself Mr. Wilson. He claimed he had something important to share with me. The letter did not elaborate on what exactly. He said he would be at the Golden Finch Cafe at eleven o'clock, Monday morning. A little presumptuous of him to book ahead, certainly, but he had roused my curiosity. In any case, a public cafe was as safe a place as any to meet a stranger. I had little to lose from hearing the man out.

When I arrived at the Golden Finch, I realised he had not described his appearance. Yet somehow, I knew exactly who he was the minute I saw him. Mr. Wilson was... Well, a queer fellow. Very peculiar. He was supposedly only in his early thirties, but his appearance suggested he was a good twenty years older than that. His hair had become a stark white and his eyes seemed to retreat into his sockets, as if they feared what they may behold. The dark rings underneath them suggested many a sleepless night. When he saw me, he did not even make the faintest smile. I didn't believe he was even capable of smiling.

'Mr. Carter, I presume?' He said as he held out his hand.

'And you would be Mr. Wilson?' I replied as I accepted the handshake. His skin had the roughness and texture of leather.

'None other. Come, have a seat.' He ushered me to a table right in the very corner. Once we had settled in, I decided it would be best to get to business. His appearance had already unnerved me and I had no desire to prolong this meeting.

'So... What is this proposal of yours?'

'My fine fellow... We cannot speak of such things on an empty stomach. Please wait until we have had breakfast.' It was clear he would not be rushed, much to my disappointment.

Being the adventurous spirit I am, I ordered the same thing I always did: eggs benedict. As for Mr. Wilson, all he ordered was a single black coffee. When his order arrived, he proceeded to stir an obscene amount of sugar into it. I found his behaviour childish. Why would any fellow order his coffee black, only to drown out the bitterness in such a manner? I spoke not my true thoughts, of course. I had only met the man and knew nothing of his peculiarities. A little tolerance goes a long way when dealing with unusual characters.

Breakfast was as pleasant as it could be, given my company. While he waited for me to finish my eggs benedict, Mr. Wilson twirled his spoon around between his fingers. You would think this was a fleeting distraction for him, but he concentrated on it with all of his energy. It was quite offputting after several minutes.

When the waiter cleared our table, Mr. Wilson stopped and looked at me. It was a wide-eyed, vacant stare. My goodness, the man did not blink once the entire time. It had been an hour by now and my patience was at its end. I had met eccentric types before, but I did not appreciate tomfoolery.

'Well, we have eaten, Mr. Wilson... Could you please tell me what this is about?' He leaned forward in his chair.

'Mr. Carter... I have heard you are interested in Atlantis.'

'Well, I have certainly stated so in my publications... But I have found no evidence suggesting it ever existed. Are you here to suggest otherwise?'

'Even better, Mr. Carter... I am in possession of charts leading right to it.' I couldn't help but scoff, as impolite as it was.

'Forgive me for being skeptical, Mr Wilson, but charts? If such a thing existed, it would have been public knowledge by now. No explorer yearns for a land already discovered.' My earlier presumption that he couldn't smile was proven wrong. Needless to say, I had no desire to see him smile again.

'Oh, my fine fellow... So well traveled, yet so poorly informed. Not all discoveries are known to the public.' Part of me bristled at his words. I had distinguished myself as one of the greats in my field, yet this man I had never heard of was questioning me? However, I realised I had been impudent myself. It was only fair that he rebuked me.

'Well... If these sailing charts do truly exist, then I wish to see them, Mr. Wilson. I am presuming you are keeping them elsewhere?' Surely this man would not be carelessly carrying around such documents in public.

'Indeed. I have a private archive for my curios and relics. I had wanted to measure your character before taking you there. You have a healthy skepticism, but you are clearly not close-minded to the possibility of the unknown... That is very good.' There was a conspiratorial tone to his voice. Undoubtedly, I was being led into some shadowy business. I half-wondered if his strange mannerisms were deliberate attempts to unsettle me.

'Here is the address for my archive. It would be in your best interest to keep it confidential.' He slipped me a piece of paper with an address written on it.

'I had not wished to spring this entire business on you at once. I felt you would need a little time to mull over it. However, I do feel that you are exactly the right man for this task.'

'Task? You did not mention any task to me before...'

'Precisely. I did not arrange this meeting merely to enlighten you. This is a business proposal.' I quickly made the connection in my head.

'...You are proposing that I sail to Atlantis for you?'

'Now, now, don't be too presumptuous. I'll be happy to clarify the details in a more private setting.' He wiped his mouth with a napkin and stood up.

'I will be presiding at my private archive for the rest of the week. If you have not visited me by Sunday, I will assume you have declined my offer.' I recoiled from his eerie grin.

'I am certain you have pressing matters to attend to, so I will not impose. Visit me at your leisure.' With little ceremony, he departed from the cafe and disappeared onto the street. The whole affair had certainly shaken my nerves. Rationally speaking, this meeting was most likely a malicious jest at my expense. Yet, there was something indefinably wrong about Mr. Wilson. I did not feel that he was merely trying to unnerve me. His unsettling mannerisms felt genuine.

The rest of that week was fraught with restlessness. I laid awake in the dark for hours on end. My wife noticed and she voiced her concern. I told her about the whole affair with Mr. Wilson. She didn't believe the man had been sincere when he mentioned Atlantis. She echoed my earlier sentiment that this was some sort of cruel joke.

Yet I could not quell the gnawing curiosity that sat uneasily in my stomach. Sunday crept ever closer and I was running out of time. I decided that I did not care if it was a joke. It would be better to settle this affair. If I didn't, I would have wondered about this meeting for the rest of my days.

Oh, how the devil damns us with our smallest choices.

So, on Saturday, I went straight to the address he gave me. It was a large, albeit unremarkable, building. A pair of ominous wooden doors barred entrance. I found a heavy iron knocker held by the grinning mouth of a gargoyle. Certainly. Mr. Wilson's choice of abode reflected the man himself.

I gave three echoing knocks on the door. I stood outside for a minute, wondering if Mr. Wilson had perhaps vacated early. I was about to turn around when I heard the door creak. There he stood, as ghastly as ever before.

'Good to see you, Mr. Carter. Please, do come in.' He opened the doors wider, revealing a stretching pit of blackness. It seemed that the interior was designed to not allow any natural light to enter. It was as dark and gloomy as those ancient castles which still dotted the English countryside. I couldn't help but hesitate. Mr. Wilson noticed my reluctance as well.

'Surely the brave explorer before me is not afraid of a little shadow?' He said. His tone was flat, but the sharpness of the words was clear.

'Forgive me for not being entirely comfortable entering such an ill lit abode. Darkness can obscure many things, Mr. Wilson.'

'I know that more than you could ever guess. But come now, we are both busy men. I wish to settle this business just as much as you do.' He was right, of course. The more that I delayed, the longer this meeting would take. So, I stepped inside.

Mr. Wilson closed the doors behind me and the sunlight retreated out of the hallway. My eyes adjusted to the din not long after. It seemed Mr. Wilson had installed electrical lighting in the building. Yet that light did little to illuminate the hall before me.

'Please follow me, Mr. Carter. It would hardly do well to conduct business at the entrance. My servant has prepared morning tea for us both.' The prospect of a morning tea did please me. I had been so nervous that morning that I did not eat breakfast.

'That would be excellent, Mr. Wilson.'

We went further into the building, eventually arriving at a wide, open aperture. This is the moment where my courage was sorely tested. The archive had no natural light. It was again illuminated by electrical lighting placed here and there.

How could I describe Mr. Wilson's private collection? Grotesque? Uncanny? Unsettling? Morbid? Macabre? All of these words would be apt. At the very entrance of the archive stood a skeleton. It seemed human, save for a pair of long, curved fangs jutting out from its menacing jaws. I had never seen nor heard of such a species of man. Perhaps it was some ancestral throwback?

Looking deeper into the gloom, all manners of queer artifacts, skeletons and curios were displayed on shelves and glass cases. The collection was vast beyond my comprehension. But in that room filled with profane objects and bizarre curios, my eyes were drawn to a certain statue which dominated the centre of the room. It was made of some green-hued stone riddled with flecks of some iridescence. To my mounting horror, I recognized it. When I encountered a particular tribe in Africa, they had made carvings of some strange squid god. A thing with the head of an octopus, the body of a man, bat-like wings and monstrous webbed claws. I hated the squid god as soon as I saw it, so my men and I quickly left. In that poor lighting, the squid god almost seemed alive. I felt that if I took my eyes off it, it would step off its sickly green pedestal and fall upon me.

'You seem to be impressed with my collection.' Mr. Wilson observed.

'It... certainly leaves an impression.' I conceded.

'Please settle yourself in. Morning tea shall be served shortly.' He gestured to a table in the corner of the room, situated right underneath an electrical light. Two comfortable looking chairs sat there facing each other.

I was served steaming hot scones drenched with fresh butter. The tea was excellent as well, with just a hint of an exotic spice that I could not name. I could not fault the man's hospitality, though it was hard to enjoy such dainty, wholesome things in the unwholesome company of Mr. Wilson's collection. After I had finished and our plates were taken away, he nodded in satisfaction.

'Very well. Let us get to business. You wished to see the charts, Mr. Carter? Here they are.' He slid something across the table. I looked down to behold a strange bundle of documents. These documents were not wrought on paper as I had expected, but thin sheets of some material that looked like mother of pearl. When I touched it, I realized it was metal. 

Opening the bundle, there it was, a sailing chart made to modern standards. It showed a pathway leading off Greece into the Mediterranean sea, ending at an island I had never seen before. What surprised me even more was the chart wasn't drawn with ink, but subtly etched into the metal itself. So subtly, in fact, that when my fingers traced over the page, I felt no indent or impression in the material at all. I have not seen such delicate craftsmanship before or since.

'What material is this made of? It is certainly wondrous.'

'Never you mind that. As you can see, the chart does indeed exist.'

'Well... I will not deny that this is a nautical chart, Mr. Wilson. But again, I am not convinced. What evidence do you have that this leads to Atlantis?' He gave me one of his unwholesome smiles.

'Once again, Mr. Carter, I appreciate your skepticism. Rest assured, I am certain of the chart's authenticity.' He leaned forward in his chair. The dim lighting in the room gave him an almost ghoulish appearance. He tapped on a strange looking sign in the corner of the chart. I would later become very familiar with that sign.

'That symbol marks it as the genuine article.' I looked at the sign, confused. It appeared to be a five pointed star wrought with curved lines, with something that resembled an eye in the middle.

'Is this some manner of Atlantean symbol?'

'More-or-less, yes.'

'But this nautical chart is up to date. Are you telling me the Atlanteans themselves created this?'

'No. What you are holding isn't the original chart, but a special reproduction wrought from more sturdy materials. I have come to despise paper. It is too delicate a medium for preserving knowledge.' I could share his frustrations in this regard.

'Well... Then what exactly is it a reproduction of?'

'The original chart was created by a Portuguese sea captain a century ago. The man lost both his way and his wits on his final voyage. In between bouts of melancholy and madness, he insisted he found a haunted island in the Mediterranean. This chart was intended to prove his claims. Given his reputation, none put any stock in his tale. After his untimely death, the chart ended up in some private collector's chambers. When I discovered the chart, I convinced its former owner to part with it. It was out of date of course, but certain contacts of mine have made appropriate amendments.' He leaned back in his chair.

'I am sure you have more questions, but that is as much as I can reveal for now. I will be more at liberty to discuss these matters once we have settled on your contract.'

'Right... And I presume that this is a contract for an expedition?'

'Naturally, Mr. Carter. You would have the necessary connections and experience to organize such an expedition. I will cover all expenses for the voyage, as well as pay you a handsome sum.'

'Very generous of you, Mr. Wilson... And what exactly would you want in return for your generosity?'

'Any and all materials, artifacts or texts you recover are my property. You may not write about anything you discover there in any publication, neither may you speak of your findings in any public setting. Any and all crew members you sign on for this expedition must agree to this confidentiality as well.' A pang of disappointment struck me.

'So, you would dangle this tantalizing discovery in front of me, only to forbid me from even speaking of it? I would not go down in history as the first Englishman to set foot on Atlantis?'

'Correct. I do not know why that would concern you. Have you not already achieved great renown? History, without a doubt, shall remember your name.'

'A fair point... But even so, this is not just some island off the coast of South America... This is Atlantis. If this is not some sort of elaborate joke on your part, I would become the single greatest explorer in history.'

'Alas, that is not what I am offering you.'

'Then by what means would you persuade me? My coffers already overflow with commerce.'

'The only thing I have to offer you is discovery. Not for the world, but for yourself. Even if you could tell no one you were there, could you stand the thought of another explorer claiming Atlantis before you?'

Lord help me, that last line roused my jealousy. Unfortunately, he was right. I could not allow another explorer to lay claim to Atlantis. This discovery would be mine. After some reading and negotiations, I signed the contract.

That single decision, made out of wanton pride, sealed my fate and that of two dozen other men. If only I knew what horrors awaited us.",1,1753767075.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Chris Haddad: Journal Two Entry Two



	When I walked out of the airport into the night, the weight of my decision hit me: I was in a new land with new people, a new culture, a language I barely understand, and no family to disappoint. I brought myself here and I was gonna make the best of it. I caught a taxi from the airport to the city center and booked a hotel room for the next two weeks. In the morning I’d find a job and plan my near future. But for now, I needed to sleep.

	The next day, the withdrawals hit me like a sack of bricks. I threw up constantly, I had a blinding headache, and I was shaking so much that I couldn't hold a glass of water without it spilling everywhere. After five days of this mixed with coffee and cigarettes, I got better. I found a construction job that paid just enough to keep me fed and under a roof.

	I came home every night drenched in sweat and dirt for nickels and dimes to keep me housed. It was a form of torture, a one that I created for myself. Maybe if I carried lumber on my shoulders everyday, I would hurt as much as Yousef did the night I ran away. Maybe if I constantly worked, I wouldn't have time to miss the pills or the bottle. Maybe this would slowly kill me, I was fine with this too. 

	After a few months, I left the city. I sold whatever didn’t fit in my backpack, and walked away from my new life again. I headed east towards the mountains, walking for days—searching for food, shelter, or maybe just a place to die. After six days, I stumbled across the mountain village of Douma. I checked into a hotel and slept like I did my first night in Beirut.

	The next morning, I went to a small restaurant for breakfast where my life would change for the better. My waitress was a young woman not much older than me named Layla. She was short, tan-skinned, and beautiful. The second I laid eyes on her, I knew she was the one. Layla was an oasis in the desert to me. I came back to that restaurant nearly every day over the next few months. Not because the food was good, but for Layla. We started talking more and more and eventually, I mustered up the courage to ask her out in my rudimentary Arabic. 

	The next night, I came up to her house and met her family. Her father was an older man named Omar who owned the restaurant Layla worked in, her mother was a woman named Nadia who took care of their kids. Layla also had five younger brothers between the ages of four and nineteen. Her family had lived in that house for many generations, since the Ottomans controlled the region. Layla didn’t want to carry on her family legacy, but wanted to own her own restaurant one day.

	We ate dinner and I walked with Layla around the village, stopping in random cafes and corner stores. We sat at a table on the street next to a kind of ice cream parlor. I told her my life story: how I grew up in an abusive household, ran away at sixteen, and struggled with addiction and mental illness. I expected her to turn away and leave me like everyone else had, but she sat and listened and understood.

	“I’m always here for you, Habibi. I promise.” Layla told me. The last person who ever called me “Habibi” was Fatima: the woman whose husband I assaulted, the woman who always walked me to bed when I was too drunk to stand, the woman who loved me regardless of anything that I did. I sobbed uncontrollably at her words. Not tears of sadness or guilt, but tears of joy. 

	We were married the next winter and started our new lives with each other. Layla found a job as a chef at a restaurant back in Beirut and encouraged me to work on my music and art again. We rented an apartment and had our first child, a boy we named Elias, later that year. For my next birthday, we had our new friends and neighbors over. Layla’s parents and brothers even drove up for the weekend to celebrate with us. This was the first birthday I celebrated since before I ran away.

	Layla lit the candles and everyone sang me happy birthday in English. Elias was sitting on my lap smiling at the small flames dancing above the cake. I was surrounded by family and friends: both new and old. They all knew what my life was like before, they all knew why I left America. Yet they all stood there smiling, singing, loving unconditionally. I blew out the candles without making a wish this time, for I had everything I’d ever wanted. Everyone cheered and we started dancing Dabke. I was twenty-seven years old and happy again.",1,1753767067.0,ShortSadStories,1,1.0,False

The sun was setting on Rosalie Moreno's life with the Moreno family, and she had hoped for a silent farewell. But as she tiptoed towards the door, ready to vanish into the dusk, Jennifer Moreno, her adoptive mother, summoned her with a voice that cut through the quiet.

In the living room, Yuri Moreno, the family's true daughter, nestled close to Yosef Lennon, the Lennons' indulged scion, on the couch. A pang of realization struck Rosalie—her presence was surplus.

The Morenos and Lennons had a marriage pact, and Yosef, who'd boasted of claiming Rosalie as his bride since their school days, was now smitten with Yuri, who'd returned only a week ago. It wasn't Rosalie he desired; it was the Moreno name.

Jennifer wasted no time in confirming Rosalie's suspicions. ""Rosalie, can't you see? Yuri and Yosef are a match made in heaven. You and Yosef were never meant to be, but they... they're perfect together.""

""Love can't be forced; it's fate,"" Jennifer continued, her tone softening. ""Don't cling to Yosef out of habit. They'll be engaged before you know it.""

Rosalie raised a skeptical eyebrow. ""Tell that to Yosef. He's the one who can't let go. I've never been interested."" She had seen through Yosef's grand gestures long ago; he was nothing more than a plaything to her.

Yosef, who'd endured Rosalie's disdain for years, harbored a grudge. Seeing her still acting with an air of superiority, even after losing her Moreno status, he sneered, ""You're just a nobody, yet you talk so big.

""No wonder I never liked you. You're a fake! Thank God we weren't engaged. I'd be stuck with you and your replacement!""

Yosef sneered at Rosalie with a look of utter disdain, yet a tinge of regret lingered in his heart. Rosalie's beauty and figure were leagues beyond Yuri's, a fact that was hard to ignore. He thought it was such a shame that Rosalie wasn't the true-born daughter of the Moreno family.

Rosalie's retorted, ""That's what I'm saying! Thank God someone else is taking you off my hands, or I'd have to look at your pockmarked face forever.""

Yosef's face, scarred by acne, twisted in anger at Rosalie's jab.

Yuri, feigning concern at Yosef's mockery, played the peacemaker. ""Yosef, don't be so harsh. She might get hurt. After all, if I hadn't come back, I wouldn't have taken you or the Moreno heiress spot from her.

""She's just lashing out because she's hurting inside. Can't you cut her some slack?"" Yuri's voice dripped with false sympathy.

Rosalie wasn't buying it. ""I'm not upset. This loser chased me for years, and I never cared. But you? A week back and you're already with him. Trash and a schemer—made for each other!""

Jennifer exploded at that, ""You heartless girl! Why are you so rude? No wonder I could never get close to you; you're naturally disrespectful.

""You lived a life of luxury for eighteen years while Yuri suffered. And now you insult her? That's outrageous!""

Rosalie, reprimanded by Jennifer, remained unflustered. Everything she had with the Moreno family, she'd earned through her secret contributions to the family's business.

Curtis Moreno, Rosalie's adoptive father, had saved enough to start a factory but lacked the business acumen to keep it afloat.

Without Rosalie's secret help, the factory would have folded, and the Moreno family wouldn't have become one of Serenity District's top merchants. But Rosalie never bragged; they were clueless about her role as the factory's biggest backer.

Curtis, dragged into the downstairs fray, frowned on purpose, playing the peacemaker.

Curtis pretended to blame Jennifer. ""Come on, that's not how you talk to Rosalie. She's going back to her family today, facing tough times. Besides, we messed up eighteen years ago; it's not her fault. Can't let her leave broken-hearted, right?""

Curtis, though hypocritical, had a fair point. But looking at Rosalie, his feelings were mixed.

He loved Rosalie since she was a kid—charming and lovely. But if she hadn't been with them, they wouldn't have missed their real daughter for eighteen years, suffering away from home.

Curtis let out a sigh as he spoke to Rosalie. ""Rosalie, you're not my blood, but I raised you for eighteen years. You're like my own kid.""

""I've done some checking. Your real folks are out of work. If you ever need something, don't hesitate to come back and ask for help,"" Curtis added, feigning kindness.

Jennifer, sitting close by, jumped up and nudged Curtis. ""Why are you being so generous? Watch out you don't end up with a freeloader! Parents without jobs—what kind of decent family is that?""

Rosalie looked at the Morenos' fake smiles and Yosef, her face blank as she said, ""No thanks, Mr. Moreno. But you might want to focus more on running the factory and the company, especially keep an eye on the people around you.""

Rosalie glanced at Jennifer, a hint of warning in her voice.

There was a real snake in the grass at the company. Jennifer and her brother had been siphoning off money for years. If Rosalie hadn't been watching them, they might have bled the company dry.

If her birth family was really struggling, Rosalie figured she wouldn't have time to deal with the Morenos' drama.

Jennifer exploded at her words, ""So you can't stand to see us doing well, can you? Even as you're leaving, you have to curse our business. Like you've ever managed the factory! What are you even bragging about?""

Rosalie knew arguing with Jennifer was a waste of time, so she just snorted, ""You'll see what I'm capable of soon enough.""

Not wanting to waste any more breath, Rosalie stood up, slung her only backpack over her shoulder, and headed for the door. Inside was just her ID and the laptop she'd bought herself. She wasn't taking anything else.

But Yosef had to get in his digs. ""Mr. and Mrs. Moreno, Rosalie didn't even bring her luggage. Who knows what valuables she's got in that bag. You'd better check it!""

Jennifer, taking the bait, immediately said, ""Yosef's right! Open it up and see what's inside!""

# 2.Chapter 2 The Enigmatic Ride

Yuri feigned concern with a practiced sigh. ""Mother, is this truly necessary? Rosalie's family is in dire straits. Even if she took a trinket or two, it's but a drop in the ocean for us. Can't we show some compassion?""

Jennifer's eyes narrowed, her voice dripping with sarcasm. ""Everything in her room was a gift from us. How dare she use our generosity to sustain her family? Her parents, jobless and adrift—will a few baubles truly make a difference?""

As she spoke, Jennifer advanced on Rosalie's backpack, intent on exposing her supposed thievery.

Rosalie, anticipating Jennifer's petty invasion, unzipped her bag with a flourish. ""Here, see for yourselves. No Moreno trinkets grace this bag. My ID is my own, and the laptop and clothes I wear were bought with the money I earned from my scholarship.""

If Rosalie hadn't been funneling her earnings to support her family, she would have flaunted her wealth in their faces. But they weren't worth the satisfaction.

Seeing the backpack's contents, Yuri and Yosef exchanged glances of disappointment. They hadn't expected Rosalie to have such integrity.

As the Morenos stood speechless, Rosalie slung her backpack over her shoulder, ready to make her exit.

Suddenly, a frail figure descended the stairs with urgency. ""Rosalie... wait for me...""

The Morenos whirled in shock to see Yancy Moreno, fresh from surgery, hastening down the stairs.

Jennifer rushed to support her son, her voice laced with panic. ""Yancy, you should be resting! Why have you left your bed?""

Yancy, battling severe aplastic anemia, had undergone a bone marrow transplant by a mysterious doctor. Though the surgery was successful, he was still fragile, needing to avoid stress and exertion. They had kept him from Rosalie, but he defied their wishes.

Rosalie's heart, usually encased in ice, wavered at the sight of Yancy, the one who had always been weak yet her staunch protector.

At that moment, Yancy glared at Jennifer, his voice sharp. ""If you hadn't confined me, I wouldn't have had to rush."" The butler, under orders, had barred his way, but Yancy had slipped past. Luckily, Rosalie was still within reach.

Without delay, Yancy produced a card and pressed it into Rosalie's hand. ""Rosalie, I've heard about your family's plight. I've set aside some savings over the years. Please, take this, should you find yourself in need.""

Holding the card, Rosalie felt a warmth in her chest. In a family of strangers, Yancy was the only one who truly cared. It made all her efforts—researching his illness, ensuring his surgery's success—worthwhile. Now, as she left, Yancy was her only concern.

Seeing Yancy's generosity, Jennifer's face pinched with anxiety. ""You foolish boy, that's your only card, with at least ten grand in it! Why give it to her? She's not even your real sister!""

Yuri, feigning innocence, couldn't help but worry. ""Wow, Yancy is so generous to Rosalie. I've been home for days, and he hasn't even spoken to me much.""

Yosef, sensing Yuri's slight, immediately defended her. ""Come on, man, that's just too biased! You're so cold to your own sister, yet you lavish attention on that impostor.""

""You!"" Yancy fumed, his anger palpable.

Seeing Yancy upset, Rosalie's eyes darkened. She snatched a glass of water and splashed it directly in Yosef's face.

""Hey! Rosalie! How dare you!"" Yosef, heir to the Lennon family, had never been so humiliated, and he shouted in rage.

But Rosalie's gaze was icy. ""Yosef, this is the Moreno residence. Who are you to yell at the head of the Moreno family? Yancy just had surgery and can't afford the stress. Watch your tongue!""

Yosef, used to leveraging his family's friendship with the Morenos, often lingered at their home. Initially to pester Rosalie, he had lately shamelessly attached himself to Yuri, growing presumptuous, even daring to disrespect Yancy. He truly overstepped.

Realizing his blunder and noting the displeasure on Curtis and Jennifer's faces, Yosef retreated.

Yuri seized the moment to stir trouble. ""Mother, Father, even if it's to defend Yancy, Rosalie's actions were outrageous. Splashing water on guests? That's beyond rude.""

Rosalie, unwilling to waste more breath on them, handed the card back to Yancy. ""Yancy, your health comes first. Use this for your supplements. Keep the money for yourself.""

""Rosalie..."" Yancy tried to resist, but Rosalie's grip was firm. He couldn't break free.

Rosalie smiled sincerely at Yancy, ""I appreciate the thought, but Yancy, don't worry about me. I don't need money. It's you who needs to take care of your health when I'm gone."" With that, she released his hand.

Yancy, still worried, tried to insist, but Rosalie was already walking away with a casual stride.

Yosef, grumbling to himself, ""Not short on money? Even now, still pretending to be rich. Rosalie, you really know how to play the part!"" He had harbored this complaint for years and finally let it slip.

Yet, Yosef felt a twinge of discomfort. Rosalie's parting gesture—splashing water on him—left him feeling frustrated and exposed.

Seeing Yosef drenched, Yuri quickly offered a handkerchief to dry him off.

Jennifer, spying the card back in Yancy's possession, quickly snatched it. ""Thank goodness she had the decency to refuse. Otherwise, it would have been a disaster.""

Outside, Rosalie noted the Moreno family's driver made no move to offer her a ride, so she decided to call an Uber. To her surprise, a sleek black sports car, its brand discreet yet its presence commanding, pulled up just then.

Though the car's logo was subtle, the engine's purr betrayed its exclusivity. Under the sunlight, the black paint gleamed with a brilliance that hinted at hidden luxury.

A glance at the tires and rims confirmed their high-end origins. This car was no ordinary vehicle; it was a custom creation by a wealthy individual, likely as valuable as a Bugatti or Lamborghini.

Rosalie assumed an important figure had arrived. But to her astonishment, the man who emerged was shabby, with dark circles under his eyes.

He appeared no more than a few years older than her, yet his unshaven face and disheveled appearance contrasted starkly with his bright, piercing eyes. Upon seeing Rosalie, his eyes widened in recognition. ""You must be Rosalie?""

# 3.Chapter 3 The Yoder Arrival

The man who stepped out of the unmarked luxury sports car was none other than Rosalie's biological brother, Zaki Yoder. His eyes widened at the sight of Rosalie, and he exclaimed, ""You and Mom... you two could pass for sisters.""

The Yoder family had planned for someone to collect Rosalie today. Zaki, having just wrapped up a high-stakes case, was on his way home for a much-needed break and decided to make a detour to pick up his long-lost sister.

He had half-expected to have to ask the Morenos to point out Rosalie, but the moment he saw her, he knew without a doubt that she was his sister.

Rosalie raised an eyebrow, skepticism etched on her face. ""You're my brother?""

""Indeed, I'm Zaki, your third brother,"" Zaki replied, stepping forward with a grin.

Then, a realization struck him. Glancing down, he remembered he had been tailing a drug lord for days, without sleep or a change of clothes, and he had come straight here. Exhausted, he had forgotten to stop and grab a fancy suit to make a good impression.

""Sorry, I was in a rush and forgot to change,"" Zaki said, the tough commander feeling oddly self-conscious for the first time in front of Rosalie.

Rosalie was about to dismiss it as no big deal when Yuri interjected from behind her, ""Oh my, where'd this vagrant come from? Security, why are you letting just anyone in?""

The Moreno family's gatekeeper hurried over, explaining, ""Miss, this gentleman claimed he was here to see Rosalie, so I let him through.""

Yuri feigned surprise and turned to Rosalie. ""Oh... Rosalie, I had no idea he is your family. Please disregard my earlier comment.""

Rosalie gave Yuri the cold shoulder. ""If you're truly sorry, the best thing you can do is be quiet. No one wants to hear your incessant chatter."" With that, she walked past, opened Zaki's car door, and tossed her bag inside.

At that moment, Yosef arrived, seeking to settle a score. Seeing Zaki's beat-up car without a logo, he smirked. ""Never seen a car without a brand. Did you put this together yourself?""

Zaki leaned against the car, worn out, and replied, ""Yeah, it's custom."" They were a special forces team, and they all drove modified vehicles, especially this one, designed by his fifth brother, Kenneth Yoder.

Kenneth was still in school, but he was already a prodigy in weapon design for the Defense Department. His creations, once tweaked, were incredibly powerful and unmatched.

These cars could save a life in a tight spot. So, this car was worth more than any luxury car out there, and it hadn't come cheap.

But Yosef didn't understand and continued to mock Rosalie. ""I can't believe your family even has a car, but without a logo, who knows if it's stolen.""

Yuri chimed in, feigning concern, ""Rosalie, you should be careful. You could get entangled in some legal trouble!""

Rosalie had had enough of their nonsense, and now they were insulting her family. They had reached her limit.

Before Rosalie could speak, Zaki's face darkened. He strode over to them, his imposing figure over six feet tall as he towered over Yosef. Placing a heavy hand on Yosef's shoulder, Zaki said, ""Kid, you can't just run your mouth. Didn't anyone teach you that?""

After years of rigorous training and interrogating criminals, Zaki had earned the nickname ""Ice King."" His glare suggested Yosef might wet himself. Never had Yosef seen someone so intimidating. Yosef stammered, ""I-I-I was just guessing.""

Zaki snorted, ""Guessing? Sure, you can say what you want, but there's a price for every word. If your folks didn't teach you that, I can."" As he spoke, he squeezed Yosef's shoulder a bit harder.

In an instant, Yosef's shoulder popped out of its socket. He felt his arm go limp and screamed, ""Ouch! I won't do it again! Please, let me go!""

Zaki finally eased up, coldly putting Yosef's arm back in place.

Yosef was too terrified to utter a word.

Yuri, standing nearby, didn't fully grasp what had happened, but Yosef was pale as a ghost from the pain.

Zaki glanced at Yuri, causing her to shiver. His stare was absolutely terrifying.

""Young lady, I don't hit women. I'll let you slide today, but watch your mouth next time. I won't tolerate anyone cursing my family,"" Zaki said coldly.

Terrified, Yuri could only nod.

Zaki dialed back the intimidating aura and turned to Rosalie with a grin. ""Hey Rosalie, let's bounce.""

Rosalie gazed at Zaki's grin, seeing a totally different guy from the tough character he'd just played. She knew Zaki was definitely not someone to mess with.

Since he'd already shown Yosef and Yuri who was boss, Rosalie decided to play it cool. ""Alright, Zaki."" With that, she hopped into the car cheerfully.

Zaki, not thinking much of it, agreed, slid into the driver's seat, buckled up, and drove off from the Moreno residence. All that was left were Yuri and Yosef, staring in shock as the car vanished into the distance.

""Who is that guy really..."" Yosef muttered, feeling his arm had healed, but the fear from moments before still lingered in his heart.

Yuri shook her head. ""I don't know either, but the license plate seemed to be from Janivelle. And it looked like a police plate too."" It was puzzling; Zaki looked so scruffy, and yet he was driving a police car from Janivelle.

""You must have seen it wrong,"" Yosef shook his head. He had been too scared to notice those details, but he was sure she must have missed it.

Rosalie's original family was supposedly all out of work—there was no way that they could afford a car with Janivelle plates. After all, only locals could use Janivelle license plates.

Getting a residency permit in Janivelle was not something just anyone could do. Even with all the Moreno family's money, they still had out-of-town plates. They bet Rosalie's family must be really poor; there was no way they were locals from Janivelle.

# 4.Chapter 4 Her Family Is Super Loaded

In the car, Zaki felt a bit awkward and said to Rosalie, ""Sorry, Rosalie, I was in such a rush I forgot to bring a change of clothes. I'm a bit messy, and now people are talking about you because of me.""

Zaki really didn't care about what he wore or used, but he couldn't afford to embarrass Rosalie.

Rosalie shook her head understandingly. ""It's fine, as long as the clothes are comfy.""

Zaki felt a bit warmer towards Rosalie. But when he noticed she only had one backpack, he couldn't help but ask, ""Rosalie, didn't you bring any luggage? Just this one bag?""

Rosalie nodded, her tone cool. ""I don't want anything from the Moreno family.""

Zaki, being good at reading people, noticed the displeasure in Rosalie's tone, and his gaze cooled a bit. He quickly said, ""It's alright. Once we're home, anything you need, I will buy for you.""

Rosalie gave a gentle smile. ""Okay."" No matter what her family's real situation was, at least Zaki genuinely cared for her.

Rosalie noticed the route Zaki was taking and couldn't help but ask, ""Zaki, isn't this road leading to Oceanside Manor?""

Oceanside Manor was home to the wealthiest and most influential people in Janivelle. The manor was huge, almost taking up the whole East District. As people went up the hill, they passed by groups of big mansions and a few fancy estates.

Even though the Moreno family moved to Janivelle not too long ago, they had already figured out their main goal was to get close to the ten ancient families of Janivelle, all gathered in the East District.

Unfortunately, the road leading to the hill was lined with checkpoints. Without an invitation from a property owner within the mansion district, entry to Oceanside Manor was not allowed.

However, their car paused briefly at a checkpoint, the license plate was identified, and they were immediately granted access.

Zaki casually replied, ""Yeah, Mom and Dad are waiting for you at home.""

Rosalie couldn't help but raise an eyebrow at the fact—her house was actually in Oceanside Manor.

At this moment, Rosalie started to question Curtis's investigation. Curtis had said that her parents and brothers were all unemployed. If that was the case, there was no way that her family could live in Oceanside Manor.

Rosalie frowned, thinking, 'Curtis has always been unreliable in getting things done. Otherwise, I wouldn't have to manage the company behind the scenes. He probably assumed they were unemployed and jumped to conclusions.

'But that's fine. Since my family is quite well-off, I don't need to worry about supporting them anymore.'

As they drove past several small villas, she thought the car would stop, but it didn't. When she saw a large villa, she couldn't help but think, 'It seems like my family is richer than I thought.'

Yet Zaki's car continued for another ten minutes, exiting the villa area and heading straight into the manor district. Rosalie narrowed her eyes, thinking, 'It seems my new home is exceptionally wealthy!'

But just as she was settling into her thoughts, the car kept going. It eventually drove all the way to the top of the mountain.

Oceanside Manor was named so because the road at its peak had no barriers, and clear seas stretch out on both sides.

At the end of this road, there was just one mega mansion. This was also a landmark people can spot from downtown Janivelle, the Skyline Castle.

It was a landmark because Skyline Castle sat at the peak of Janivelle, and people can spot this castle-like building from way off in the city center.

This place was said to be personally managed by a world-class designer, making it a super luxurious and modern landmark.

Inside this grand castle, people can catch the sunrise over the ocean in the morning and the most beautiful sunset over the sea at night, which was why it was named after this stunning view.

The owner of this place was a mystery. It was rumored that even the ten most prestigious families in Janivelle couldn't touch them. Yet, no one really knew who owned Skyline Castle.

They say the owner was incredibly wealthy, with investments all over the place. But they didn't run a family business; instead, top managers and stewards handled everything.

So, this mansion's owner had never shown their face, and nobody knew the true identity of their family members.

Just when Rosalie thought Zaki was just showing her the view and would soon head to another villa area, Zaki surprised her by driving straight into this museum-like estate.

In the sunlight, the fountain at the center of the estate splashed water in all directions, reflecting bright rays. The sculpture in the middle was actually a masterpiece by a famous modern artist, clearly worth a fortune.

Even Rosalie, who was used to appraising valuable artifacts, thought the sculpture was truly exceptional.

At this moment, Zaki's car slowly stopped at the front entrance of the castle. Before Rosalie could gather her thoughts, Zaki got out and, with a gentlemanly flair, opened her door. ""Welcome home, Rosalie.""

As soon as he finished speaking, over twenty servants lined up on both sides of the red carpet at the entrance bowed in unison and said, ""Welcome home!""

For a moment, Rosalie felt like she had stepped onto a movie set.

""Zaki... Is this... my house? Really?"" Even though Rosalie wasn't short on money and had seen plenty of influential people, she was still a bit shocked.

After all, she was prepared for her family to be broke, with her parents and siblings all jobless, relying on her to support them. She never expected a complete turnaround. Her family turned out to be the legendary top-tier mysterious billionaires of Janivelle.

# 5.Chapter 5 Back Home

Zaki looked at Rosalie's somewhat surprised expression and smiled warmly, ""Yes, this is your home. Go on in, Mom and Dad are waiting for you.""

Rosalie composed herself and got out of the car, glancing at the extravagant red carpet beneath her feet, feeling a bit awkward as she walked up. ""Isn't this a bit too much?""

Zaki smiled, ""It's important."" After all, Rosalie had been through so many hardships over the years. Her first time home should be celebrated.

While they were speaking, two figures dashed out from the grand doors at the end of the red carpet. ""Is that Rosalie?!"" A voice filled with excitement and melody called out.

Rosalie looked up to see a middle-aged woman in a simple dress, yet she was elegant and ladylike. Although she was over forty, she maintained herself very well, resembling a famous actress, gentle and charming.

Beside the woman was a charismatic middle-aged man, standing tall and handsome, looking very much like Zaki. Rosalie could immediately tell that this couple must be her parents.

They were looking like a wealthy couple, having nothing related to the broke couple Curtis had mentioned.

At this moment, Roxanne Yoder had already reached Rosalie, grabbing her hand with tears in her eyes. ""That's it... this is truly my daughter. Zachary, look at how much she looks like me, right?""

Zachary Yoder was equally surprised as he looked at Rosalie and Roxanne's strikingly similar faces and agreed, ""Yeah, she really looks a lot like you.""

Roxanne was once an internationally renowned superstar, known for her stunning and unique beauty.

Initially, no one suspected their daughter Xyliana Yoder had been switched at birth. But when puberty hit, and Xyliana started to look less like Roxanne and Zachary, people began to whisper, and they felt something was wrong.

They didn't expect that shortly into their investigation, the Moreno family would discover the mistaken swap, and the police confirmed it with DNA tests between them and Rosalie, finally confirming Rosalie was indeed their biological daughter.

Initially, they planned to conduct a DNA test after Rosalie returned home, but now it seemed unnecessary. Rosalie looked exactly like a younger version of Roxanne, without any makeup, yet she exuded breathtaking beauty and pure charm.

Rosalie couldn't believe how much she looked like her mother either.

Jennifer had always kept Rosalie at arm's length because she was cute and pretty from a young age, and as she grew, she became stunningly beautiful.

Jennifer even wondered if Rosalie was really her own daughter. Driven by these doubts, Jennifer started investigating, and to her surprise, her suspicions were confirmed.

Rosalie felt that she truly found her biological parents.

""Dad, Mom, the wind is strong outside, let's go inside and talk."" Being at a seaside mansion, the sea breeze was indeed strong. Zaki gently reminded Roxanne, worried she might catch a cold.

Roxanne nodded excitedly. ""Yes, yes, I was so excited I forgot! Let's go in,"" she said, grabbing Rosalie's hand as they walked inside.

Rosalie felt Roxanne's soft and warm hand, and a wave of warmth spread through her heart. Having been resented by Jennifer since childhood, Rosalie rarely experienced a mother's care and love. Now she could finally feel just how comforting her mother's warmth was.

They walked in together. First, they went through the foyer. Even though it was just a small entrance hall, it felt like an art gallery, with walls covered in paintings, and in front of them, various pottery and sculptural artworks were displayed.

As Rosalie passed by one of the pottery pieces, she paused for a moment. She pondered, 'This piece of art looks so familiar.'

Noticing Rosalie's gaze, Roxanne quickly asked, ""Rosalie, do you like this artwork?""

Rosalie paused for a moment, feeling awkward, and just nodded. She replied in her heart, 'Of course, I like it. I made it.'

However, with so many artworks she finished each month, she usually just packed them up and had her assistant take them to her art studio to sell.

This particular piece only took her three hours at most to finish. She never thought it would end up at her parents' house.

Roxanne said, ""If you like it, feel free to put it in your room. It's the masterpiece of a mysterious new artist. I bought it a month ago at a charity auction for 3 million dollars. It wasn't expensive, but it's quite creative.""

Hearing this, Rosalie's lips twitched, thinking, '3 million dollars, and it is not expensive?'

Although the Moreno family was among the top three wealthy families in Serenity District, they couldn't just easily spend 3 million dollars on such a small piece of art. And it was something Rosalie created on a whim. She couldn't help but guess how rich her family was.

They all moved to the main hall, where several servants were lined up on either side.

Ten of them were holding trays with various drinks. Even the coffee had several types, while another group carried assorted snacks.

Roxanne walked by with Rosalie and said softly, ""Since it's your first time home, I didn't know what you like to drink, so we made all sorts of coffee. We've also got a variety of juices. Just choose what you like.

""And over here are the pastries from Janivelle's best bakeries. I got one of each flavor for you to taste, so feel free to try them.""

Seeing Roxanne's eager eyes, Rosalie had to choose a cup of freshly ground coffee and two pastries. ""I don't like it too sweet. The matcha and osmanthus flavors are just perfect.""

Roxanne was immediately overjoyed. ""I never would have guessed that our tastes are so similar.""

The selected servant brought the pastries, while the others left.

Zaki then said, ""Mom, Dad, I'm going to change my clothes.""

Zachary looked at Zaki's messy appearance and sighed, ""You're now the leader of Special Unit A of Interpol! What kind of case would make you personally lead a team to such an extent? If I'd known you looked like this, I wouldn't have sent you to pick up Rosalie. What if you scared her?""

Zaki felt embarrassed. ""We were capturing an international drug lord this time. It wasn't just me; even the deputy chief personally led the operation.""",2,1753767043.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

Context: My bestfriend (M20) and I (F19) have been friends since we were just kids (family friend). We went to the same school hanggang high school so we were really close. And during our 8th or 9th year, we met this guy who's a year ahead of us in a school org, and he liked him SO BAD. 
Although, he never made a move to tell him na he likes him, kasi he feels like the guy is straight daw. But it was an open secret within our circle, like everyone teases him to the guy over the years until the guy graduates.

My friend and I are now in college. We're studying in different universities. And I went to the univ where the guy is studying. 
So since I don't know anyone else from the univ and since we used to interact naman kahit papano back in hs, I messaged him during the enlistment season last year (I'm an incoming soph now) to ask him to guide me with the process. Don't get me wrong, I even told my friend that time na I'm about to message the guy, and he was just cool and we just joked about it. 
Then, during my first weeks to months in college, he guided me with things sa campus and I don't know when and how, but we became close friends cause he was really nice and helpful like he sometimes invite me to go and study together and even pay for my coffee and food (i love free stuff). Honestly, when he was acting nice, I didn't want to say or assume anything kasi baka feeling lang ako. But sht happened and long story short, he asked me out🙂

Previous attempts: I'm losing my mind. I told the guy when he asked na I'll ask my parents muna to buy myself some time and I madesomeone from our high school circle to find out if my bestfriend still likes the guy cause i don't know what to do🥲🥲",1,1753767024.0,adviceph,7,1.0,False

Started off ok, owner was a bit strange but I chalked it up to interview awkwardness? Anyway first shift went smooth, loved everything about it and was excited!

Then the next three shifts had me questioning if I should work here. First the owner told me that there were grounds in the coffee pot so if a customer complains give them a new one. You should really replace the whole pot if there are grounds but I decided to check and see if there would be any floating around in it. There weren’t so I dumped out the tiny bit I got and threw the paper cup away. The owner TAKES IT OUT OF THE TRASH, looks at me and says “you wasted a cup, these cost me 30 cents. Don’t do that.” Then proceeds to go to the back and wash the cup, that has BEEN IN THE TRASH and bring it back up and put it back in the queue to be used again. I was so baffled. This is apparently a common occurrence because there were a ton of one use cups back there washed and ready to be put back out. There were also plastic forks and knives in the sink which I threw away. 

Next, a customer ordered a bag of coffee beans and needed it ground. I ground it and handed it to the counter and called his name but he had left the store for some reason. I shrugged and went back to the line of people waiting for me. Fast forward five minutes the guy comes back and is like did you ground my coffee, I was confused and it turned out another customer took it. Probably because we are made to ground it into bags that look like pastry bags rather than the bags they originally come in. So much for saving money?
Anyway, the owner starts freaking out and saying “there goes twenty dollars!” And starts slamming things around and giving me and my go worker a lecture on how we can’t hand things out on the counter when the customer isn’t there. It’s not my fault somebody wasn’t paying attention and grabbed something I clearly yelled the name for. 
Then he went on a rant about how he can’t leave the place to go somewhere else because there’s always mistakes. Pretty sure mistakes are from the stress of him being around. 

There are also a ton signs on the doors saying ,No WiFi/ no laptops allowed, watch your kids, no free water and a lot of other rules which is pretty off putting. Every little thing that happens it seems he needs to micromanage it. 

One coworker said to me that “I have no idea what I signed up for.” Which I am really believing now. 

Should I just ghost the job, two week notice? They are still hiring and leaving without notice isn’t something I normally do but I really don’t think I can just tough this one out. ",1,1753766562.0,WhatShouldIDo,0,0.67,False

## Key Features Analysis

Polish pottery mugs boast several distinctive features that set them apart from mass-produced alternatives. These include the exceptional craftsmanship, the use of high-quality clay, the elaborate designs, and the overall durability.

**Handcrafted Artistry**

Each Polish pottery mug is meticulously handcrafted by skilled artisans.The process begins with shaping the clay on a potter's wheel or using molds, followed by careful decoration using various techniques, including stamping, sponging, and painting. The intricate designs are a testament to the artisan's dedication and expertise, making each mug a unique work of art. No two mugs are exactly alike, adding to their distinctive charm.

**Durable Earthenware**

Polish pottery is made from a specific type of clay found in the Bolesławiec region of Poland. This clay is known for its high silica content and exceptional durability. The mugs are fired at high temperatures (typically around 2280°F or 1250°C), which vitrifies the clay, making it resistant to chipping, cracking, and crazing. This high-firing process also ensures that the mugs are safe for use in the microwave, dishwasher, and oven (within reasonable temperature limits). The glaze also protects the mug from staining.

**Elaborate Designs and Patterns**

One of the most recognizable features of Polish pottery mugs is the wide variety of vibrant designs and patterns. Customary motifs include floral patterns, geometric shapes, and whimsical animal figures. Common design elements involve cobalt blue, green, red, and yellow colors applied in intricate arrangements. Certified Polish pottery carries stamps indicating various patterns (e.g., UNIKAT for more intricate designs) and the artisan's signature or studio mark.

**Oven, microwave, and Dishwasher Safe**

Due to the high-firing process, Polish pottery mugs are incredibly versatile and safe for everyday use. They can withstand temperature fluctuations, making them suitable for both hot and cold beverages. The mugs can be safely placed in the microwave to reheat drinks and washed in the dishwasher without damage. They are also oven-safe to certain temperatures, making them useful for baking small desserts or warming snacks. However, avoid sudden temperature changes such as going from freezing to very hot instantly.## Core Benefits

The robust construction ensures that they can withstand daily use and frequent washing without losing their beauty or functionality.

These mugs meet stringent food safety standards, making them a healthy and reliable choice for everyday use.

The map was spread out over the makeshift table, pinned down by a cracked rock and a dented iron mug that still smelled faintly of burnt coffee.

I stared at the lines rotting veins of a dying city.
No route felt safe.
No plan was clean.
No decision came without the taste of blood.

Behind me, Zula’s footsteps.
Two seconds later, her voice  steady, sharp:

“They’re ready. Waiting for you.”

I took a breath.

The room wasn’t big, but it felt tight. Like every wall had moved two inches closer.

Zula.
Giulia.
Tom.
Samuel.

The older ones. The ones still standing.

All of them looking at me.

“Let’s begin,” I said, placing both hands on the table. “We need to go on the offensive. We can’t keep reacting. But we also… can’t throw these kids into the fire.”

Giulia spoke first. Precise. Measured.
A voice like a scalpel.

“We can’t act out of emotion. We’ve already lost too much. If we move like Gabe, we’ll drown in blood with nothing to show for it. We need to strike strategic points. Break the Association without lighting ourselves on fire.”

Zula scoffed.

“That sounds great on paper, Giulia. Truly. But we’re surrounded by teenagers. Kids. They’ve never seen a real war. They’ve never watched someone they love bleed out screaming. Power means nothing when the bullet lands. If we go all-in now… we lose.”

Tom nodded slowly.
“Yeah… Giulia’s right. And Zula too. I think… yeah, that makes sense. Both of them. Definitely.”

Samuel let out a quiet breath half amusement, half contempt.

“Brilliant, Uncle Tom. Revolutionary stuff.”

He stepped forward, his eyes sharper than knives.

“Maybe not a full-on assault. But something like Gabe’s approach smarter, cleaner. We hit them where they don’t expect it. And we make every hit count.”

I listened. I nodded.
But inside…
Inside, I was crumbling.

They didn’t know how many times I’d watched these kids nearly die.
How many nights I woke up convinced I had sacrificed them all.

Samuel kept going, voice steady.

“We don’t need to start a war overnight. We start with cracks. Pick specific Golden Capes. Take them out, one by one. Quietly. And loud enough. If the strongest start disappearing… the Association breaks. Trust dies. That’s when we strike.”

I stared at the map.

It could work.
It really could.

But it also meant more danger. More blood. More loss.

“That would risk their lives,” I murmured. “Too much.”

Samuel didn’t even blink.

“Zenos, this is war. And in war, blood is what you lose the most.”

“No.”

The word exploded out of me before I could swallow it. The table rattled as my fists hit wood.

“No, Samuel. I can’t think like that. I won’t let them die. I won’t throw them away like the Association did.”

Silence stretched like skin over a wound.

Zula’s voice broke it.

“Then we stop pretending. We train them. We push them. And maybe… maybe I can help. Their bodies might be ready. Some of them might already be evolving. If we time it right, I could trigger something bigger.”

“I don’t know if that’s the path,” I said, quieter now.

Giulia’s eyes were fierce.

“It’s one of them. We don’t have time to debate metaphysics. They need to get stronger.”

“It’s not just about strength,” I growled. “They need control. They need to learn how to fight — to survive. You give a bomb to a child and all you’ll get is an explosion.”

Tom shrugged from the corner.

“And for that,” he muttered, lighting a cigarette with fingers that didn’t tremble anymore, “we need what we don’t have.”

He looked up.

“Time.”

———

**Leo**

The air reeked of sweat, rust, and something darker.

A shadow moved too fast. I didn’t even see where it came from.

“Left!” Clint shouted, but it was already too late.

Pain sliced through my shoulder. Cold, like it didn’t belong to this world.

Samuel’s clone passed through me like smoke.
But it wasn’t smoke. It was a blade.
Samuel didn’t train soft.

I dropped low, tried to find a window — an opening.

“Leo!” Danny’s voice cut through. “Make him disappear!”

I raised my hand toward the clone focused on its movement, its core and it blinked out of existence.

Gone. Like it had never been there.

But I still felt it. The echo in the air.
The tension of Samuel’s power, waiting to reform.

Danny landed beside me fast, like a blood-stained lightning bolt.
His hands were soaked in crimson.
Not from the enemy.
From himself.

He moved with fluid grace, spinning midair and throwing up a wall of blood between us and the next clone.
I could hear it hissing against the impact.

“You’re leaking again,” I said.

He gave a sheepish half-smile.

“Zula said I’ve got almost twice the blood of a normal human. Literally. If I go too long without using it, it starts… leaking on its own.”

I looked down. Even with his dark shirt, the droplets were staining the floor beneath him.
Slow.
Steady.
He bled just by standing still.

“She said that’s why I’m always overheating. My body’s forcing it out. It’s where the speed comes from.”

“That’s disgusting,” Clint muttered, wiping sweat from his brow. “But also… kind of badass.”

Two more clones dropped from the ceiling.

Clint cursed under his breath and threw up a hand.
A pulse of energy burst out the clone in front of him paused, staggered.
Blocked.

But only for a second.

“Every time we drop one, two more show up,” Clint said. “It’s like shadow math.”

“Samuel’s going hard today,” I said, trying to catch my breath. “Like he’s got something to prove.”

Danny cracked his neck and tightened the bandages at his wrist. Blood slid over his fingers like armor.

“He’s always got something to prove.”

The clones circled again.
Samuel could control five at once and every one of them fought like it was him.
Precise.
Cruel.
Unforgiving.

“Can you imagine him in a real fight,” Clint muttered, “with the intent to kill?”

I swallowed.
My legs were burning.
My shoulders ached.
My power was humming in my fingertips, raw and restless.

“He’d win,” I said. “Fast. Violently. No mistakes.”

Danny nodded, his eyes dark, but focused.

“Yeah. But we’re getting better.”

I believed him.

Because today, when I used my power, it wasn’t out of fear.
I didn’t flinch. I didn’t hesitate.
I chose.
And the thing in front of me was gone.

Not running.
Not hiding.

Erasing.

Clint dropped next to us, gasping, shirt torn and a bruise forming under his jaw.

“New rule: kill one clone, get two more. Welcome to shadow hell.”

We laughed cracked, breathless sounds.
But they were real.

Then Danny’s grin faded.

“You guys heard about Tasha?”

I nodded.

“She woke up this morning. Zula said she’s still… distant. Barely speaking.”

“Covered in bruises,” Clint added, looking down. “And burns. She’s not okay.”

No one said anything after that.
The laughter died.

The air thickened. Heavy.

We were fighting shadows in a bunker.
But outside… the real monsters were still waiting.

And we were still just kids, trying to stay alive.

———

felt it before I saw it.
The drop in temperature.
The way the shadows around us… breathed.

Clint turned, wiping blood from his mouth.
“You feel that?”

Danny tensed beside me.
Then a voice, sharp and low, rolled through the room like smoke.

“Tired already?”

Samuel stepped out of the wall.

Literally.

His body unfolded from a patch of darkness in the stone like he’d been living inside it.
Eyes lazy. Shirt soaked from the neck down. No sign of exhaustion.

“Hope you had fun with the warm-up,” he said, smirking. “Now let’s see what the real thing feels like.”

We barely had time to react.
He moved.

The first punch cracked against Clint’s power-block — a hard wall of energy shattering it like brittle glass.

“Shit!” Clint cursed, stumbling back as a shadow clone appeared behind him and swept his leg.

Samuel vanished — dropped into the floor like ink in water.
Reappeared behind Danny. Elbowed him in the ribs.
Gone again.

I tried to track him.
Couldn’t.

He was in every wall.
Every shadow.

Three clones circled us, each one with his smirk, his timing, his rhythm.
It felt like fighting ghosts with blades.

Danny went feral, blood snapping from his hands like coiled whips. He sliced one clone in two —
Only for it to reform behind him.

Clint triggered a pulse of light it exploded — and for a split second, everything stopped.

And there was Samuel. Ten meters away. Watching.
Arms crossed.
Judging.

“You call that effort?” he asked. “Come on. Show me something that makes me care.”

Clint managed to block him once just once and that felt like a win.

I screamed, “Now, Clint! Block him!”

He threw up the light shield again just as I shouted:

“Disappear!”

And the clone in front of us blinked out of existence.
Gone.
Erased from the space between us.

Clint froze, blinking.
“Leo… did you just—?”

Then it hit us.
Literally.

A splash of blood smacked across our faces — hot, metallic.

We turned.

Danny stood still, eyes wide, trembling.

Samuel was crawling out of Danny’s shadow like it was a coat he’d just unzipped.
His grin was slow and sharp, one arm wrapped loosely around Danny’s throat — not choking, but warning.

“Now I’m getting proud,” he said. His voice was low, sincere… and terrifying. “But you need to understand something — what’s out there is worse. A lot worse.”

He let Danny go like he was letting go of a student, not a target.

“I’ve never fought you to kill. Out there, they will. And if you’re really planning to take on those golden bastards…”

He paused, wiped blood from his fingers, and flicked it to the floor like it didn’t matter.

“Then stop wasting Zenos’ hope. Start proving you’re more than just his regrets.”

He turned.

And three new clones dropped from the ceiling like wolves —
One slammed into Clint’s ribs, knocking him down.
Another tackled Danny hard, pinning him.
The third crashed into me, stealing the air from my lungs.

Samuel’s voice echoed behind him as he walked out.

“Prove to me — prove to him that you’re not wasting your second chance.”

The door closed.

But the training didn’t stop.

Not now.
Not until we earned the right to bleed.

———

**Zula**

They were screaming.
Blood flying. Shadows cracking. The ground trembling under their feet.
And me? I just watched.

Three little idiots thrown against the world like they asked for it.
Leo gasping, Danny bleeding from places he didn’t even know he had, and Clint—bright, but still too damn soft.

And Samuel…
Samuel smiled like it was all a dance.
That smug bastard.

Zenos stood next to me, arms crossed, doing his best to pretend he wasn’t worried.

“Can you increase their powers?” he asked, voice low, like that would make the question smarter.

I rolled my eyes.

“Come on, Zenos. Don’t insult me. Of course I can. What do you think I am, one of your little half-trained nobodies?”

Before he could respond, Giulia stepped forward—quiet, sharp-eyed, always listening before speaking.

“And Jerrod?” she asked. “Could his power be enhanced too? He’d be a major asset if it grew.”

I turned to her with more patience than I usually spare.

“No. He inherited Tulio’s power. Hereditary gifts are off-limits. I can’t amplify or weaken those. All I can do is stabilize them… help the user understand what the hell they’re carrying.”

Zenos rubbed the back of his neck. Still full of doubt, that one.

“But Zula,” he said, “what if boosting them too early harms their bodies? What if we should focus on strengthening their physical limits first—”

I snapped my head toward him.

“Zenos, do you think I’m an idiot like you?”

He blinked.

“You think I don’t know my own power? That I’d increase their energy if they couldn’t handle it? You think I want them bursting like overripe tomatoes on the battlefield?”

He stayed quiet for a second, so I kept going. I wasn’t done yet.

“If I choose to do it, it’s because I know their bodies can take it. Period.”

He looked down, then up again—more hesitant this time.

“Then… I want you to boost Gabe.”

I stared at him.

“No.”

“Zula, please—”

“I didn’t feel confident about him last time. I felt something off. Something unstable. And guess what? I was right. Look at what that little punk is doing now.”

Zenos squared his shoulders.

“He’s fighting for his people. He’s giving his life for what he believes in. That has value.”

“And he’s taking lives by the dozen, too, isn’t he?”

My voice was ice.

“No, Zenos. I won’t help the boy from the Red Sector. The hero of the forgotten will stay forgotten by me.”

“Mother, please…”

“Don’t ‘mãe’ me now.”

I turned my gaze back to the fight.

Danny took a shadow-punch to the ribs and spat blood.
Leo was barely standing.
Clint had light flashing like a dying star.

“Don’t let Samuel kill them,” I said.

Zenos looked over at me, surprised.

“End this damn training,” I continued. “Tell them to eat something. And let the old Zula take a proper look at what we’re working with.”

Weddings are among the most important parts of life and this is why photography is a vital element. Those moments need to be captured artistically and beautifully. Pre-wedding shoots, and full wedding coverage involved actual moments and for couples that story and emotional connection is priceless. In Surat, there has been a recent boom in demand for wedding photographers as couples are looking for different creative ways to document their special moments and preserve their memories.

Couples are no longer looking for just photos. They want a complete experience. They want their stories to be visually told along with a creative theme, personalized touches highlighting their individuality and journey together. This is where professional wedding photographers in Surat.

# Why Choose a Professional Wedding Photographer in Surat?

https://preview.redd.it/bi2k57m4zqff1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c4660c87fba94bd785543ab44c76ec05caaee35

Many couples question whether hiring a professional photographer is worthwhile when smartphones and amateur photography are so widespread. The answer is simple when analyzing the results. A professional wedding photographer does not only take pictures; they tell a story. They understand lighting, composition, and timing. These three components may determine whether a wedding photo is attractive, memorable, or legendary. 

A wedding photographer professional, in Surat, will have the capacity to use different styles, such as Candid Photography, Traditional Portrait images, and cinematic video shoots. Each distinction has its advantages; candid photography captures un-posed emotional realism while cinematic wedding video has an opportunity for dramatic story telling similar to a film experience. Aside from the fundamental knowledge required to be a photographer, professionals provide creative experience that produces an album that provides an individual personality to each couple.. 

One major benefit of hiring an experienced professional photographer is the dependability factor. Weddings are usually fast-paced, stimulating events, as well as unpredictable to a degree. It is invaluable to have a professional with the ability to adapt to changing elements, varying lighting, and who will make sure to capture every last bit of importance. 

# Key Factors That Impact Wedding Photography

By comparing each wedding experience we are given, we can provide an understanding of expected photography experiences at weddings. The scope of photographic experiences varies by number of events, cultural traditions, and even the actual size of the area where the wedding will take place. For example, traditional Gujarati weddings are often tagged with multiple ceremonies over a few days. Photographing these wrap around events requires planning, multiple phones and cameras, and occasionally drone coverage for outside/in nature events. 

The gear makes a difference too! With technology at its peak, we have become more streamlined for weddings and all photography experiences. In regards to equipment used, our canon or nikon cameras take awesome images with 22mp and above with a cinematic lens or even a professional lighting setup. This becomes helpful for occasions where the lighting is not ideal for the photographer to work with, such as dimly lit banquet halls or evening beach photo shots. Drone cameras are often used to provide an aerial and majestic feel to wedding videos and events. 

Lastly, but certainly not least, the photographer's creativity will not only define what is captured but also what the final product will be, whether it be a video or image. A good photographer knows how to build and effectively narrate through images alone. This may take shape as a joyful smile within a moment during a haldi ceremony, or perhaps a more intimate or tender moment depicted during the pheras. Experienced and professional photography teams in Surat.

# Popular Pre-Wedding Shoot Locations in Surat

Pre-wedding shoots have evolved into a modern-day ritual, as it gives couples the opportunity to showcase their personalities ahead of the wedding day. Luckily, Surat has a number of fantastic pre-wedding shoot locations that offer everything from nature themes to architectural themes.

One of the favourite outdoor locations for pre-wedding shoots is Dumas beach. The beach offers a long flat shoreline making for ideal couple candid moment opportunities with picturesque sunset views. Sarthana Nature Park has lush green surroundings and is ideal for pre-wedding shoots with nature tone aspects. There are also many heritage locations and luxury hotels for couples who'd like an upscale royal tone to their pre-wedding shoot. Urban themes also appear to be popular where studios create set designs indoors with props and lighting to suit the couple's personalized intended concept.

# How to Choose the Right Wedding Photographer

Let’s start with a review of portfolios. A good portfolio shows the photographer's versatility, and gives you an idea if there is alignment with your style. Some couples are most excited about candid, emotional story-telling, while others may want posed classic portraits. Look for consistency across quality in different weddings, as that indicates professionalism and experience. 

Meeting with the photographer in person or, at minimum, via video chat is equally important. In the conversation, you will also learn how they work, and this is a good opportunity for you to set expectations. It is important to discuss timelines, deliverables, and album designs ahead of time, in order to avoid unwanted surprises later on. Part of your discussion should include any backup plans. What will you do if it rains on your wedding day or the camera fails? An experienced photographer will have contingency solutions planned as part of their business.

# Creative Pre-Wedding Photography Idea

https://preview.redd.it/8je605b5zqff1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e82b8b8be3a2b6f4467e1b87703ec2661b78707

Modern couples want something more than just gorgeous photos; they want their story to be narrated in imaginative and ingenious ways. This is why pre-wedding photography has been a progressive field of creativity. For some couples they are choosing to tell a story based on themes such as retro Bollywood themes or themed around their cultural heritage, reflecting Gujarati traditions. Others prefer modern minimalism and focus simply on feelings and their connection to each other rather than using props and backdrops.

There are props, outfits, and individualized items becoming more normal, even couples bringing musical instruments, books, or pets. Locations are also selected based on the couple's unique personality, whether it's in the middle of a busy street with lots of urban energy or sitting quietly by a river for a romantic atmosphere.

# Tips to Make Your Wedding Photos Stand Out

The best wedding photography happens in you and your partner's natural expressions in relaxed moments. It is so important to feel comfortable in front of the camera, and helping your couple feel that comfort is paramount. You could help them get that comfort by rapport building with the photographer before the wedding day. This could be something as simple as meeting for coffee or going out for a small pre-shoot.

The way the couple and bridal party dress, hair, makeup and color palette play a huge part in wedding photography too. One mistake many couples make is not having a coordinated outfit or color palette. The same goes for group photos - matching outfits, or somewhat similar tones colors keeps things visually balanced and 'stylish.' I'll also mention timing. The best time for photography is ideally the 'golden hour' which refers to the moving light just after sunrise, or just before the sun sets.

Above all, talk to your photographer honestly. If there are moments that are particular to you—an emotional moment with your parents, or a fun candid with friends—be sure to talk about it. Skilled photographers will value this feedback, because reviewing these requests allows them to better plan and contemplate what is most important to you.

Okay, firstly... I'll absolutely admit that this may sound a bit odd at first, but hear me out please! And please read this whole post!

I guess lately, I've been feeling very overwhelmed. I'm navigating complex health issues, I'm having a hard time building friendships in a city that still feels very new to me (because I haven't gone out much), and of course I'm feeling stressed from working on projects that push me to my limits, and all that sort of stuff. 

With all the above, and more, weighing on me... I'm sort of feeling this overwhelming urge to just be held, and squeezed. I mean, it is one of those things that has been known to bring comfort to many people who are on the autistic spectrum after all, including myself. And yeah, I don't presently have anyone in my life who could offer such a thing. So, I guess I'm reaching out to the redditverse?

I mean, I'd absolutely love to cook you some food! We could watch a show, listen to music, talk (or not), and of course we could do the squeeze whenever you felt comfortable! The squeeze would ideally last for a few minutes, but that can be discussed. I just think it should be long enough that i can actually allow myself to relax into it. Ideally, we should talk online, and meet for a coffee first since something like this requires at least a bit of established trust. 

Honestly, I don't even know if posting this will yield anything. I'm nervous about even being this vulnerable with expressing a need like this. But hey, I've met some fabulous people on reddit before... so honestly? Why not?

If you are open to this concept, feel free to reach out! I'd love to talk, and see what we can do from there! If you'd benefit from a good squeeze too, I can do the same for you!

A bit about me! I'm 26, non binary, living in Coquitlam (but can travel anywhere!). I'm neurodivergent (obviously), and have interests that range from music, art, and creativity, to transit, and horror! I love going out into nature sometimes, but I also enjoy staying in, and gaming too. I'm also trying to get into alternative fashion more!

For something like this, I probably would prefer to connect with other LGBTQ+ folks, and neurodivergent folks too. I do tend to be picky about the cis men I connect with, but I'm not opposed. Just please approach me with a message that actually shows you read this post, and DO NOT bring up, or even imply anything that is NSFW, otherwise I will block you! This act is meant to be platonic in nature. 

Anyways! I look forward to hearing from some people!

1mc2k8g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mc2k8g,Use These 7 Psychological Tricks to Raise Your Prices (Your Customers Won't Even Mind),"# The Psychology of Pricing: 7 Ways to Increase Your Prices Without Losing Customers

Let's be honest. The thought of raising your prices probably sends a jolt of anxiety right through you. What if my customers leave? What if they think I'm getting greedy? What if all my competitors swoop in and steal my business?

These fears are completely normal. As small business owners, we pour our hearts and souls into what we do, and our relationships with our customers feel personal. The last thing we want to do is alienate them.

But here’s a hard truth: failing to increase your prices strategically is one of the fastest routes to business stagnation. Costs go up—your suppliers charge you more, your software subscriptions increase, your rent gets hiked. If your prices stay the same, your profit margins shrink, you have less to reinvest in your business, and you eventually start working harder for less.

The good news? There’s a smarter way to approach this. It’s not about arbitrarily slapping a higher number on your products or services. It’s about understanding the fascinating field of **pricing psychology**. By leveraging proven psychological triggers, you can confidently raise your prices in a way that not only retains your customers but can actually make them feel *better* about buying from you.

This isn't about manipulation. It's about communicating value, building trust, and framing your prices in a way that resonates with how the human brain makes decisions. Ready to learn **how to increase prices** like a pro? Let's dive in.

# 1. The Power of Anchoring: Frame the New Price Against a Higher Number

Anchoring is one of the most powerful cognitive biases in a marketer's toolkit. It describes our tendency to rely heavily on the first piece of information offered (the ""anchor"") when making decisions. Once an anchor is set, other judgments are made by adjusting away from that anchor, and there is a bias toward interpreting other information around the anchor.

**How it works:** Instead of just presenting the new, higher price, you present it alongside a more expensive option or its ""original"" higher value first. This makes the new price seem far more reasonable in comparison.

**Examples in Action:**

* **Software Companies:** You've seen this a million times. A company offers three tiers: Basic ($29/mo), Pro ($59/mo), and Enterprise ($149/mo). Most people don't need the Enterprise plan, but its high price tag makes the $59 Pro plan—the one they *want* you to buy—look like a fantastic deal.
* **Retail Boutique:** A clothing store could display a new, high-end designer jacket for $750 at the front of the store. Suddenly, the beautiful $250 blouses and $150 jeans deeper inside the store feel much more affordable. The $750 jacket is the anchor.
* **Service Providers:** A consultant raising their project rate from $4,000 to $5,000 could present it as: ""Our standard project rate is $6,500, but for our existing partners, we're offering a special rate of $5,000."" The $6,500 becomes the anchor, making the $5,000 feel like a discount rather than an increase.

**Best Practices:**

* **Be Realistic:** The anchor needs to be believable. Anchoring a $20 t-shirt against a $1,000 price will just seem absurd.
* **Lead with the Anchor:** Always present the higher price first.
* **Combine with ""Was/Now"":** For sales, show the original price crossed out next to the new, lower price (e.g., ""\~\~$120\~\~ Now $99!""). This anchors the customer to the higher value.

# 2. Justify the ""Why"": Transparency Builds Trust

In the age of the informed consumer, people don't just want to know *what* the price is; they want to know *why*. A price increase without explanation can feel arbitrary and unfair, leading to resentment. A well-explained price increase, however, can actually strengthen **customer retention** by building trust and reinforcing your brand's commitment to quality.

**How it works:** You proactively and transparently communicate the reasons behind the price adjustment. This isn't about making excuses; it's about sharing your story and connecting the price to tangible value.

**Examples in Action:**

* **The Local Coffee Shop:** ""Dear Valued Customers, To continue sourcing the highest-quality, ethically-farmed coffee beans from our partners in Colombia and to ensure our amazing baristas are paid a fair, living wage, we will be adjusting our prices slightly starting October 1st. This change allows us to never compromise on the quality you deserve and the values we all share. We're so grateful for your continued support.""
* **A SaaS Company:** ""We're excited to announce three powerful new features coming to your dashboard next month! To support this major platform upgrade and our continued investment in providing you with the best-in-class tools, our monthly subscription will be increasing by $10 on your next billing cycle. We're confident these new features will deliver more than 10x that amount in value to your workflow.""
* **A Freelance Graphic Designer:** ""As my business has grown, I've invested heavily in advanced training and industry-leading software to deliver even better results for my clients. To reflect this enhanced expertise and the greater value I can now bring to your projects, my hourly rate will be adjusted from $75 to $95, effective for all new projects starting in July.""

**Best Practices:**

* **Focus on Benefits, Not Just Costs:** Frame the ""why"" around customer benefits (better materials, improved service, new features) rather than just your own rising costs (""our rent went up"").
* **Give Advance Notice:** No one likes a surprise bill. Give your existing customers plenty of warning—at least 30-60 days—before a price change takes effect.
* **Be Confident, Not Apologetic:** State the change clearly and confidently. If you sound sorry about it, your customers will feel like they *should* be upset.

# 3. Embrace Value-Based Pricing: Price the Outcome, Not the Input

This is a fundamental shift in thinking for many business owners. Cost-plus pricing (your cost + markup) is simple, but it puts a cap on your earnings and commoditizes your work. **Value-based pricing**, on the other hand, ties your price to the perceived value and ROI you deliver to your customer.

**How it works:** You stop charging for your *time* or your *materials* and start charging for the *transformation* or the *solution* you provide. This requires a deep understanding of your customer's pain points and goals.

**Examples in Action:**

* **The Web Designer:** Instead of charging $50/hour, they charge a $10,000 flat fee for a ""Conversion-Optimized E-commerce Website."" Why? Because they can demonstrate that their work will likely generate an additional $100,000 in sales for the client in the first year. The $10,000 price tag is a no-brainer investment.
* **The Financial Advisor:** Instead of a 1% fee, they might charge a fixed retainer for a ""Retirement Freedom Plan"" that gives a client the peace of mind and a clear roadmap to retire five years earlier. What is that peace of mind and extra five years of freedom worth? A lot more than 1%.
* **The Organic Skincare Brand:** A simple moisturizer might cost $5 to make. Cost-plus pricing would sell it for $15. But if the brand uses rare, sustainably sourced ingredients and can prove its product clears up acne when nothing else works, it provides immense value. The price could be $75, and customers who have struggled for years will happily pay it because the value (clear skin, confidence) is worth it.

**Best Practices:**

* **Know Your Customer's ROI:** You must be able to articulate and, if possible, quantify the return on investment a customer gets from your product or service.
* **Sell the Transformation:** Use testimonials, case studies, and data to prove your worth. Show before-and-after scenarios.
* **Offer Tiers:** Create different packages based on the level of value delivered. This allows customers to choose the level of investment that's right for them.

# 4. The Decoy Effect: Make Your Preferred Option the Obvious Choice

The Decoy Effect is a fascinating quirk of human psychology where people's preference for two options can change when a third, asymmetrically dominated option is added. In simple terms, you can nudge customers towards your desired product by introducing a ""decoy.""

**How it works:** You create three options. One is cheap (Option A). One is your target, more expensive option (Option B). And one is the decoy (Option C), which is priced either the same as or slightly more than Option B, but is clearly inferior in terms of features or quantity.

**The Classic Example: Popcorn at the Movies**

* Small Popcorn: $3 (Option A)
* Large Popcorn: $7 (Option B)

Here, the choice is tough. Is the Large really worth more than double the Small? Many people will just opt for the Small. Now, let's introduce a decoy:

* Small Popcorn: $3 (Option A)
* **Medium Popcorn (The Decoy): $6.50** (Option C)
* Large Popcorn: $7 (Option B)

Suddenly, the Large popcorn looks like an incredible deal! For just 50 cents more than the Medium, you get way more popcorn. The Medium decoy exists only to make the Large look like the obvious, high-value choice. Sales of the Large popcorn would skyrocket.

**Best Practices:**

* **Don't Make the Decoy Useless:** It needs to look like a plausible option, just not a very good one compared to your target option.
* **Keep it Simple:** This works best with two or three choices. Too many options can lead to decision paralysis.
* **Your Goal is to Sell the Target:** The decoy is a tool, not a product you actually expect to sell much of.

# 5. Charm Pricing: The Enduring Magic of the Number 9

It's one of the oldest tricks in the **pricing psychology** book, and it still works. Charm pricing is the practice of ending prices with the number 9 (e.g., $19.99 or $299).

**How it works:** Our brains read from left to right. When we see $19.99, our brain encodes the price as ""19 and some change,"" making it feel significantly cheaper than $20.00, even though it's only a one-cent difference. This is known as the ""left-digit effect."" It creates the perception of getting a deal.

**When to Use It vs. When Not to:**

* **Use for Value/Discount Perception:** Charm pricing is excellent for creating the feeling of a bargain. It works well for most consumer goods, subscription services, and anything where you want to signal ""this is a great price.""
* **Avoid for Luxury/Prestige Goods:** If you're selling a luxury watch, a high-end consulting service, or a premium product, using charm pricing can backfire. A price like $10,000 signals prestige and quality. A price like $9,999 can cheapen the brand and erode trust. For prestige items, round numbers often work better as they feel more ""honest"" and ""solid.""

**Best Practices:**

* **Be Consistent:** If you position your brand as a value-driven option, use charm pricing consistently across your product line.
* **Test It:** While the effect is well-documented, test it with your audience. See if a change from $50 to $49 results in a sales lift that justifies the slight price drop.

# 6. Unbundle (and Re-bundle) Your Offerings

Sometimes, the best way to increase your effective price is not to change the sticker price at all, but to change what's included. Unbundling involves taking a single, all-inclusive offer and breaking it down into a core product with optional add-ons.

**How it works:** This strategy allows you to maintain an attractive entry-level price for your core offering while generating more revenue from customers who want or need more. It gives customers more control and can lead to a higher average order value.

**Examples in Action:**

* **Airlines:** This is the classic example. The base ticket price (the unbundled offering) is low. But then you pay extra for checked bags, seat selection, priority boarding, and Wi-Fi (the re-bundled add-ons).
* **A Wedding Photographer:** Instead of one $5,000 package, they could offer a $3,500 ""Core Coverage"" package (8 hours, one photographer). Then, they can offer add-ons: a second shooter ($750), an engagement session ($500), and a premium leather album ($1,000). A client who wants everything will now pay $5,750, more than the original bundled price, but they feel in control of the choice.
* **A Gym:** The base membership is $40/month. Personal training, group fitness classes, and smoothie bar access are all additional fees.

**Best Practices:**

* **The Core Offer Must Be Viable:** The base product must still be valuable on its own. If it's useless without the add-ons, customers will feel nickel-and-dimed.
* **Create High-Value Bundles:** After unbundling, create new, attractive bundles. For the photographer, a ""$5,500 All-Inclusive"" package that includes everything might be a great option, offering a slight discount compared to buying everything à la carte.
* **This is Key for Customer Retention:** It allows price-sensitive customers to stay with you at a lower entry point, preventing them from leaving altogether.

# 7. Grandfather in Your Loyal Customers

This is perhaps the most important strategy for **customer retention** when raising prices. The idea is simple: reward your most loyal, existing customers by allowing them to keep their current price for a set period (or even indefinitely).

**How it works:** You announce the price increase for all *new* customers, but you make a special, public point of honoring the old price for your current supporters. This turns a potentially negative event into a powerful loyalty-building moment.

**Examples in Action:**

* **A Subscription Box:** ""Big news! As we continue to add more amazing products to our monthly boxes, our subscription price for new members will be increasing to $49/month on September 1st. But as a huge thank you for being with us from the early days, your price will stay at $39/month forever. As long as you remain a member, your price will never go up. It's our way of saying thanks for believing in us.""
* **A Marketing Agency:** ""To all our valued clients, please note that our monthly retainer for new partners will be adjusted to $3,000 starting in Q4. However, for all our existing clients, your current rate of $2,500 will be locked in for the next 12 months. We deeply appreciate your partnership and want to show our gratitude.""

**Best Practices:**

* **Make Them Feel Special:** Frame it as an exclusive reward for their loyalty.
* **Set Clear Terms:** Be specific about the terms. Is it forever? For 6 months? For a year? Clarity prevents future misunderstandings.
* **Creates Urgency for New Customers:** This strategy has a great side effect: it encourages potential customers on the fence to sign up *now* to lock in the lower rate before the price increase hits.

I told him how the world works,  
he asked me when I stopped believing.  
I laughed about bills and deadlines,  
he smiled sadly,  
as if I had mistaken chains for trophies.

The cigarette burned low,  
ash crumbling like promises.  
He stood, chair scraping against the floor   
*""I can’t breathe here,""*  
he whispered and walked out.

Only when the door chimed shut  
did I notice he’d left something behind   
the sketch, folded once   
edges soft with handling.

I opened it.  
A drawing of me,  
not as I am,  
but as I was   
eyes full of horizons,  
fingers ink‑stained,  
a heart unarmored.

At the bottom,  
in hurried graphite,  
he’d written:  
*""Don’t let me become you.""*

Got to 600 hours a couple of days ago. July has been particularly productive, as I was in-between projects at work during the first half of the month and was able to really rack up the minutes.

No big revelations as of now compared to the last update, but I noticed that I could understand my Spanish-speaking colleagues much better now. I would sometimes jump into a meeting and NOT introduce myself yet, eavesdrop a bit and wait until they notice me so I can listen into the small talk in Spanish. I haven't really tried speaking or reading yet, but the aforementioned colleagues said that I had a good accent when I made an offhand comment one time about how much I like Costa Rican coffee.

Right now, most of the CI just comes from DS itself. I just arranged everything oldest first, filtering by difficulty level, and upping the difficulty as soon as I run out of vids to watch. Right now I'm at difficulty 55, which is still on the easy-Intermediate side of things, but I'm fine with it for now as things still seem to be somewhat interesting. Might add some external resources, but I've already gone through all of ECJ as of now and I'm not really looking for a new podcast to fill the minutes just yet.

Unlike many other reports here, I didn't really feel like I got into an intermediate slump. Everything was enjoyable throughout, and it never really got boring or tiring. Of course, some days feel better than other days, but it all evens out in the long term. Maybe it's the fact that my goals are fairly modest, and I'm nowhere near ""speedrunning"" like a lot of the posters here seem to be doing. Daily goal is 60 minutes minimum, with a larget monthly goal of 50 hours. My goal for the beginning of this year was to reach 900 hours by the end of the year; looks like I'm on track to *just* get there by the time 2026 rolls around.",3,1753764308.0,dreamingspanish,0,1.0,False

1mc2civ,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1mc2civ/a_converts_story_of_leaving_the_church/,A Convert’s Story of Leaving the Church,"Hi everyone. I wanted to share my story as a convert who eventually left the Church. I wasn’t raised Mormon, and I’m not from the U.S. In my country, Christians are a minority. I joined the Church during a very difficult time in my life—when I was a teenager, my beloved mother passed away. She had always protected me and my brothers from our abusive father. Even years later, I couldn’t let go of the pain and grief. I longed to know what happens after death—whether there’s a better place beyond this world full of suffering.

One day, I met two missionaries on the street. The first thing they said to me was, “Hey, do you believe in heaven?” That question immediately caught my interest. I started meeting with them and attending Church. Because I didn’t smoke, drink alcohol, or even drink coffee (caffeine gives me insomnia), the Word of Wisdom was easy for me to follow. It even felt like I was *meant* to join the Church. A few months later, I was baptized.

There were many kind and amazing members and missionaries in the Church. I was genuinely happy being part of the community. One especially meaningful moment was doing temple work for my late mother—it gave me a sense of peace and closure I hadn’t felt before.

A year after my baptism, I decided to serve a mission. Before going, I attended institute and finished nearly all the courses within a year because I wanted to better understand the gospel. But the more I learned about Church history and doctrine, the more questions I had.

Questions like:

* Why were there horses and steel in ancient America, according to the Book of Mormon?
* Why did Heavenly Father and Jesus wait more than a thousand years to appear to Joseph Smith?
* Why is tithing required, even when people are already struggling financially?

There was a young international student in my ward who lived solely on a scholarship. He was only 23, and yet the bishop told him he couldn’t get a temple recommend unless he paid tithing. I remember how he cried because of the pressure. That really disturbed me.

Still, I thought I’d find clarity on my mission. I believed that once I started serving, everything would make sense. I even noted in my missionary application that I suffer from hyperhidrosis and asked not to be sent to hot climates. I knew I wasn’t physically well-suited for a mission, but I wanted to go anyway—everyone told me missions were life-changing, full of miracles.

Then came my endowment. It was *nothing* like what I expected—it was honestly bizarre. The clothes, the rituals, the prayer circle… it all felt strange. Like something out of a weird movie. I had imagined something deeply spiritual, like baptism, but instead, I was told I'd get used to it after doing it a few more times. Everyone congratulated me, but inside, I felt confused and uncomfortable.

Soon after, I got my mission call—to a tropical country. I was shocked. I had specifically stated I couldn’t handle hot weather, but I chose to be obedient and go anyway.

The MTC was fun for a few weeks, but once I got to the mission field, my president assigned me to an area with **zero investigators**. My trainer and I walked in the blazing heat for over six hours every day, trying to find people to teach. I was sweating so much that the skin on my forehead turned gray from wiping it constantly. Every night, I cried in the bathroom of our apartment.

I asked the mission president for help, but he said, “You were assigned here by the Spirit through the Apostles. You need to endure.”

At a zone conference, he announced: “You’re no longer allowed to use Facebook or Google Photos. Complete obedience brings complete blessings.” That phrase hit me hard—it was almost identical to what my abusive father used to say. That was the moment I realized: this Church isn’t about love or truth. It’s about control. About obedience. About tithing. All in the name of God.

Even worse, I watched my trainer tell poor people on the street—who had to work on Sundays just to survive—that if they stopped working on Sundays and paid tithing, God would bless them. I was heartbroken and furious. How could the Church brainwash people so deeply?

Eventually, I decided to go home. I couldn’t do it anymore.

After returning, I suffered for months with trauma, depression, and bipolar disorder. I never imagined my first time seeing a therapist would be because of a *church*.

The boys loved Dagon's Mirror, so I wanted to write something that felt authentically Lovecraftian. This story will be a bit frontloaded, but I hope you enjoy it nonetheless.



To whomever it may concern, 

I wrote this as a recollection of my final adventure. Though it has been many years, I still recall every detail with perfect clarity. 

To give you some background, my name is Harold Carter. I was an explorer throughout the late 19th and early 20th century. A dying breed as it were. Much of Earth has been discovered, conquered and catalogued by this point. Yet I still believed there was something more out there for me.

At this point in my life, I had married, earned my fortune and achieved great renown among my fellow scholars and explorers. A rich, full life at the age of thirty. Yet I yearned for new horizons, just as great Alexander had yearned for Okeanos beyond the seas of sand. What I desired was lost Atlantis.

This notion was well known to the public. Their skepticism of my position was natural. After all, countless others had sought that mysterious civilization and found nothing. I must admit that even I found my yearning to be somewhat fanciful. After all, Atlantis was considered a myth even during the time of Plato. If any evidence of its existence still remained, no man of science had found it yet.

That all changed on the day that I received a letter from a man who called himself Mr. Wilson. He claimed he had something important to share with me. The letter did not elaborate on what exactly. He said he would be at the Golden Finch Cafe at eleven o'clock, Monday morning. A little presumptuous of him to book ahead, certainly, but he had roused my curiosity. In any case, a public cafe was as safe a place as any to meet a stranger. I had little to lose from hearing the man out.

When I arrived at the Golden Finch, I realised he had not described his appearance. Yet somehow, I knew exactly who he was the minute I saw him. Mr. Wilson was... Well, a queer fellow. Very peculiar. He was supposedly only in his early thirties, but his appearance suggested he was a good twenty years older than that. His hair had become a stark white and his eyes seemed to retreat into his sockets, as if they feared what they may behold. The dark rings underneath them suggested many a sleepless night. When he saw me, he did not even make the faintest smile. I didn't believe he was even capable of smiling.

'Mr. Carter, I presume?' He said as he held out his hand.

'And you would be Mr. Wilson?' I replied as I accepted the handshake. His skin had the roughness and texture of leather.

'None other. Come, have a seat.' He ushered me to a table right in the very corner. Once we had settled in, I decided it would be best to get to business. His appearance had already unnerved me and I had no desire to prolong this meeting.

'So... What is this proposal of yours?'

'My fine fellow... We cannot speak of such things on an empty stomach. Please wait until we have had breakfast.' It was clear he would not be rushed, much to my disappointment.

Being the adventurous spirit I am, I ordered the same thing I always did: eggs benedict. As for Mr. Wilson, all he ordered was a single black coffee. When his order arrived, he proceeded to stir an obscene amount of sugar into it. I found his behaviour childish. Why would any fellow order his coffee black, only to drown out the bitterness in such a manner? I spoke not my true thoughts, of course. I had only met the man and knew nothing of his peculiarities. A little tolerance goes a long way when dealing with unusual characters.

Breakfast was as pleasant as it could be, given my company. While he waited for me to finish my eggs benedict, Mr. Wilson twirled his spoon around between his fingers. You would think this was a fleeting distraction for him, but he concentrated on it with all of his energy. It was quite offputting after several minutes.

When the waiter cleared our table, Mr. Wilson stopped and looked at me. It was a wide-eyed, vacant stare. My goodness, the man did not blink once the entire time. It had been an hour by now and my patience was at its end. I had met eccentric types before, but I did not appreciate tomfoolery.

'Well, we have eaten, Mr. Wilson... Could you please tell me what this is about?' He leaned forward in his chair.

'Mr. Carter... I have heard you are interested in Atlantis.'

'Well, I have certainly stated so in my publications... But I have found no evidence suggesting it ever existed. Are you here to suggest otherwise?'

'Even better, Mr. Carter... I am in possession of charts leading right to it.' I couldn't help but scoff, as impolite as it was.

'Forgive me for being skeptical, Mr Wilson, but charts? If such a thing existed, it would have been public knowledge by now. No explorer yearns for a land already discovered.' My earlier presumption that he couldn't smile was proven wrong. Needless to say, I had no desire to see him smile again.

'Oh, my fine fellow... So well traveled, yet so poorly informed. Not all discoveries are known to the public.' Part of me bristled at his words. I had distinguished myself as one of the greats in my field, yet this man I had never heard of was questioning me? However, I realised I had been impudent myself. It was only fair that he rebuked me.

'Well... If these sailing charts do truly exist, then I wish to see them, Mr. Wilson. I am presuming you are keeping them elsewhere?' Surely this man would not be carelessly carrying around such documents in public.

'Indeed. I have a private archive for my curios and relics. I had wanted to measure your character before taking you there. You have a healthy skepticism, but you are clearly not close-minded to the possibility of the unknown... That is very good.' There was a conspiratorial tone to his voice. Undoubtedly, I was being led into some shadowy business. I half-wondered if his strange mannerisms were deliberate attempts to unsettle me.

'Here is the address for my archive. It would be in your best interest to keep it confidential.' He slipped me a piece of paper with an address written on it.

'I had not wished to spring this entire business on you at once. I felt you would need a little time to mull over it. However, I do feel that you are exactly the right man for this task.'

'Task? You did not mention any task to me before...'

'Precisely. I did not arrange this meeting merely to enlighten you. This is a business proposal.' I quickly made the connection in my head.

'...You are proposing that I sail to Atlantis for you?'

'Now, now, don't be too presumptuous. I'll be happy to clarify the details in a more private setting.' He wiped his mouth with a napkin and stood up.

'I will be presiding at my private archive for the rest of the week. If you have not visited me by Sunday, I will assume you have declined my offer.' I recoiled from his eerie grin.

'I am certain you have pressing matters to attend to, so I will not impose. Visit me at your leisure.' With little ceremony, he departed from the cafe and disappeared onto the street. The whole affair had certainly shaken my nerves. Rationally speaking, this meeting was most likely a malicious jest at my expense. Yet, there was something indefinably wrong about Mr. Wilson. I did not feel that he was merely trying to unnerve me. His unsettling mannerisms felt genuine.

The rest of that week was fraught with restlessness. I laid awake in the dark for hours on end. My wife noticed and she voiced her concern. I told her about the whole affair with Mr. Wilson. She didn't believe the man had been sincere when he mentioned Atlantis. She echoed my earlier sentiment that this was some sort of cruel joke.

Yet I could not quell the gnawing curiosity that sat uneasily in my stomach. Sunday crept ever closer and I was running out of time. I decided that I did not care if it was a joke. It would be better to settle this affair. If I didn't, I would have wondered about this meeting for the rest of my days.

Oh, how the devil damns us with our smallest choices.

So, on Saturday, I went straight to the address he gave me. It was a large, albeit unremarkable, building. A pair of ominous wooden doors barred entrance. I found a heavy iron knocker held by the grinning mouth of a gargoyle. Certainly. Mr. Wilson's choice of abode reflected the man himself.

I gave three echoing knocks on the door. I stood outside for a minute, wondering if Mr. Wilson had perhaps vacated early. I was about to turn around when I heard the door creak. There he stood, as ghastly as ever before.

'Good to see you, Mr. Carter. Please, do come in.' He opened the doors wider, revealing a stretching pit of blackness. It seemed that the interior was designed to not allow any natural light to enter. It was as dark and gloomy as those ancient castles which still dotted the English countryside. I couldn't help but hesitate. Mr. Wilson noticed my reluctance as well.

'Surely the brave explorer before me is not afraid of a little shadow?' He said. His tone was flat, but the sharpness of the words was clear.

'Forgive me for not being entirely comfortable entering such an ill lit abode. Darkness can obscure many things, Mr. Wilson.'

'I know that more than you could ever guess. But come now, we are both busy men. I wish to settle this business just as much as you do.' He was right, of course. The more that I delayed, the longer this meeting would take. So, I stepped inside.

Mr. Wilson closed the doors behind me and the sunlight retreated out of the hallway. My eyes adjusted to the din not long after. It seemed Mr. Wilson had installed electrical lighting in the building. Yet that light did little to illuminate the hall before me.

'Please follow me, Mr. Carter. It would hardly do well to conduct business at the entrance. My servant has prepared morning tea for us both.' The prospect of a morning tea did please me. I had been so nervous that morning that I did not eat breakfast.

'That would be excellent, Mr. Wilson.'

We went further into the building, eventually arriving at a wide, open aperture. This is the moment where my courage was sorely tested. The archive had no natural light. It was again illuminated by electrical lighting placed here and there.

How could I describe Mr. Wilson's private collection? Grotesque? Uncanny? Unsettling? Morbid? Macabre? All of these words would be apt. At the very entrance of the archive stood a skeleton. It seemed human, save for a pair of long, curved fangs jutting out from its menacing jaws. I had never seen nor heard of such a species of man. Perhaps it was some ancestral throwback?

Looking deeper into the gloom, all manners of queer artifacts, skeletons and curios were displayed on shelves and glass cases. The collection was vast beyond my comprehension. But in that room filled with profane objects and bizarre curios, my eyes were drawn to a certain statue which dominated the centre of the room. It was made of some green-hued stone riddled with flecks of some iridescence. To my mounting horror, I recognized it. When I encountered a particular tribe in Africa, they had made carvings of some strange squid god. A thing with the head of an octopus, the body of a man, bat-like wings and monstrous webbed claws. I hated the squid god as soon as I saw it, so my men and I quickly left. In that poor lighting, the squid god almost seemed alive. I felt that if I took my eyes off it, it would step off its sickly green pedestal and fall upon me.

'You seem to be impressed with my collection.' Mr. Wilson observed.

'It... certainly leaves an impression.' I conceded.

'Please settle yourself in. Morning tea shall be served shortly.' He gestured to a table in the corner of the room, situated right underneath an electrical light. Two comfortable looking chairs sat there facing each other.

I was served steaming hot scones drenched with fresh butter. The tea was excellent as well, with just a hint of an exotic spice that I could not name. I could not fault the man's hospitality, though it was hard to enjoy such dainty, wholesome things in the unwholesome company of Mr. Wilson's collection. After I had finished and our plates were taken away, he nodded in satisfaction.

'Very well. Let us get to business. You wished to see the charts, Mr. Carter? Here they are.' He slid something across the table. I looked down to behold a strange bundle of documents. These documents were not wrought on paper as I had expected, but thin sheets of some material that looked like mother of pearl. When I touched it, I realized it was metal. 

Opening the bundle, there it was, a sailing chart made to modern standards. It showed a pathway leading off Greece into the Mediterranean sea, ending at an island I had never seen before. What surprised me even more was the chart wasn't drawn with ink, but subtly etched into the metal itself. So subtly, in fact, that when my fingers traced over the page, I felt no indent or impression in the material at all. I have not seen such delicate craftsmanship before or since.

'What material is this made of? It is certainly wondrous.'

'Never you mind that. As you can see, the chart does indeed exist.'

'Well... I will not deny that this is a nautical chart, Mr. Wilson. But again, I am not convinced. What evidence do you have that this leads to Atlantis?' He gave me one of his unwholesome smiles.

'Once again, Mr. Carter, I appreciate your skepticism. Rest assured, I am certain of the chart's authenticity.' He leaned forward in his chair. The dim lighting in the room gave him an almost ghoulish appearance. He tapped on a strange looking sign in the corner of the chart. I would later become very familiar with that sign.

'That symbol marks it as the genuine article.' I looked at the sign, confused. It appeared to be a five pointed star wrought with curved lines, with something that resembled an eye in the middle.

'Is this some manner of Atlantean symbol?'

'More-or-less, yes.'

'But this nautical chart is up to date. Are you telling me the Atlanteans themselves created this?'

'No. What you are holding isn't the original chart, but a special reproduction wrought from more sturdy materials. I have come to despise paper. It is too delicate a medium for preserving knowledge.' I could share his frustrations in this regard.

'Well... Then what exactly is it a reproduction of?'

'The original chart was created by a Portuguese sea captain a century ago. The man lost both his way and his wits on his final voyage. In between bouts of melancholy and madness, he insisted he found a haunted island in the Mediterranean. This chart was intended to prove his claims. Given his reputation, none put any stock in his tale. After his untimely death, the chart ended up in some private collector's chambers. When I discovered the chart, I convinced its former owner to part with it. It was out of date of course, but certain contacts of mine have made appropriate amendments.' He leaned back in his chair.

'I am sure you have more questions, but that is as much as I can reveal for now. I will be more at liberty to discuss these matters once we have settled on your contract.'

'Right... And I presume that this is a contract for an expedition?'

'Naturally, Mr. Carter. You would have the necessary connections and experience to organize such an expedition. I will cover all expenses for the voyage, as well as pay you a handsome sum.'

'Very generous of you, Mr. Wilson... And what exactly would you want in return for your generosity?'

'Any and all materials, artifacts or texts you recover are my property. You may not write about anything you discover there in any publication, neither may you speak of your findings in any public setting. Any and all crew members you sign on for this expedition must agree to this confidentiality as well.' A pang of disappointment struck me.

'So, you would dangle this tantalizing discovery in front of me, only to forbid me from even speaking of it? I would not go down in history as the first Englishman to set foot on Atlantis?'

'Correct. I do not know why that would concern you. Have you not already achieved great renown? History, without a doubt, shall remember your name.'

'A fair point... But even so, this is not just some island off the coast of South America... This is Atlantis. If this is not some sort of elaborate joke on your part, I would become the single greatest explorer in history.'

'Alas, that is not what I am offering you.'

'Then by what means would you persuade me? My coffers already overflow with commerce.'

'The only thing I have to offer you is discovery. Not for the world, but for yourself. Even if you could tell no one you were there, could you stand the thought of another explorer claiming Atlantis before you?'

Lord help me, that last line roused my jealousy. Unfortunately, he was right. I could not allow another explorer to lay claim to Atlantis. This discovery would be mine. After some reading and negotiations, I signed the contract.

That single decision, made out of wanton pride, sealed my fate and that of two dozen other men. If only I knew what horrors awaited us.",1,1753764186.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

I usually just read other people’s stories, but I guess now I’m the one looking for some outsider perspective. I don’t even know if I’m overthinking or just too in my head right now or maybe I’m just blowing this out of proportion Idk I’m a mess right now but anyways….this is going to be a long read sorry.

I’m Julian, 21M, and my girlfriend Elena is 30F. Yes, I know the age gap’s a thing. 9 years, people always have something to say about it, but I’m a grown adult, alright and I get that it looks ""weird"" to some people, but it’s not like that. We’re in love, like, I can’t imagine my life without her. She’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me. We’ve been together for about a year, and she’s so amazing, always looking out for me when I was in a really bad spot.

I dropped out of community college last year cause I couldn’t handle classes and work, plus stuff at home was a total mess. My mom’s been struggling with drinking and mental health stuff since my dad died when I was a kid. I was stuck paying bills, keeping the house together, all that. It got so bad I had to crash with a friend, but that was rough too.

Me and Elena met when I was working at a coffee shop a couple blocks from her office at this big graphic design company that does branding for huge clients. She’s a senior designer there, super talented, not running the place but she has a solid role. She’d come in most mornings for her usual black coffee, sometimes a latte if she was in a good mood. We started talking while I made her drinks, first about the music on the shop’s playlist: we both love indie bands like Tame Impala and Phoebe Bridgers. Then we got into graphic design, cause I used to mess around with Photoshop and Illustrator, making posters for my friends’ bands just for fun when I was younger. She’d talk about her work, like designing logos or client presentations, and I thought she was so beautiful, way out of my league with a really nice smile and charming personality and so of course I’d get all nervous around her, but she was always so nice, never made me feel dumb for stumbling over my words.

One day, she mentioned their team was short-staffed cause an office assistant quit, and they needed someone to handle stuff like emails, scheduling meetings, and organizing project files. I’d told her the coffee shop job sucked: It had bad pay and brutal hours. She asked if I’d ever thought about office work, and I was like, “Not really, but I’d try it.” She didn’t promise me anything, just said they were hiring and I should apply. I thought there was no way I’d get it, but I was desperate, so I sent my resume, got an interview, and somehow landed the job as a junior office assistant.

We kept talking at work, got super close, and a few months later, we started dating. When my friend’s lease ended and I had nowhere to go, she let me move into her apartment. She’s never made me feel like I owe her, and I’m so grateful. She’s always doing sweet stuff, like buying me gifts, shoes, watches, or picking out clothes she thinks I look good in and I trust her cause she’s got such good taste. It’s the first time I’ve felt very secure and at peace.

But last Friday, we had this big fight, and I’m still so upset, mostly at myself. Elena invited some friends over for dinner at her place, like 5 or 6 people. I’d only met one of them before, and I suck at meeting new people. My social anxiety’s bad, I get sweaty hands and can’t think of what to say. I didn’t wanna ruin the vibe, so I tried to act normal, laugh at their jokes, throw in a comment or two. I even wore this new t shirt she had picked out for me, thinking it’d help me fit in, but I still felt like I didn’t belong. They’re all her age, talking about their careers, marketing campaigns, stuff I don’t really get.

At one point, I tried to hold her hand on the table, cause I was freaking out inside and just wanted to feel close to her or maybe reassured and just needed simple cute contact but she brushed my hand off and pulled her hand away super fast and kept talking to her friend like nothing. I know it’s a small thing, but it did hurt me so bad and I felt like she was embarrassed of me or didn’t want them to know we’re together. I sat there the rest of dinner feeling dumb, stupid, awkward and so out of place.

After her friends left, we were cleaning up in the kitchen, and I told her I felt ignored and mentioned the hand thing. I wasn’t trying to pick a fight, I swear, just wanted her to understand how tough it was for me. But she got annoyed and said I was “making everything about me” and that I’m “always so awkward” around her friends and it's not her fault I lack social skills. I’ve told her about my social anxiety, and she’s usually so supportive, and she's even seen me work through it even, but this time it felt like she was throwing it in my face.

I then asked why she pulled her hand away, and she said I was being “way too sensitive” and imagining stuff and that never happened. We started arguing louder, and yeah, I cried I was really frustrated. I hate fighting/or any sort of conflict with her. It genuinely makes me feel awful, and I felt so shut down. She said sorry later that night, but I couldn’t shake it and her apology didn’t feel sincere to me I felt like she just apologized for the sake of it.

The next day, I grabbed some clothes and went to my mom’s to get some space. My mom’s trying to stay sober, but it’s a roller coaster, and being there’s not great she just watches TV all day, barely talks and sleeps, its a bit awkward every time we talk but it’s a familiar place to be I guess. She noticed I had been quiet and asked what’s up, so I told her most of it and why we fought. She already knew about me and Elena. She wasn’t happy about the age gap at first when I told her we were dating, with all the chaos in my life back then, but she got over it when she saw I wasn’t gonna break up with her just cause people don’t get it. I told her I love her and I mean it so so much. I’m an adult, and this is my choice. She didn’t say much, but last night she said, “You gotta listen to your heart and pick what you really want, not what’s easy. What do you want?” I don’t even know how to answer that. I’m so confused right now.

It’s been a few days, and my girlfriend’s been texting and calling, saying she’s sorry and wants to talk again but I haven’t replied. I don’t know if I’m being a jerk or just need space. I love her so much, but I hate feeling like I’m too much or not good enough for her.",1,1753763400.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

# Choosing Your Espresso Machine

Starting your journey with espresso can be exciting. The right machine makes all the difference. A good espresso machine helps you brew the perfect cup every time. Understanding the features and types is crucial. Let’s dive into how you can select the best one for your needs.

# Types Of Espresso Machines

Espresso machines come in various types. Manual machines give you full control. Semi-automatic machines provide convenience while maintaining some control. Automatic machines are easy to use and require less effort. Super-automatic machines do everything for you, including grinding and brewing. Each type offers a different experience.

# Important Features To Consider

When choosing a machine, look at these features:

* Pressure: Look for machines with at least 9 bars of pressure.
* Boiler Type: Single boilers are cheaper; dual boilers offer better temperature control.
* Grinder: Built-in grinders save space and are convenient.
* Ease of Cleaning: Removable parts make cleaning easy.

# Setting Your Budget

Budget plays a big role in choosing a machine. Decide how much you’re willing to spend. Entry-level machines can start around $100. High-end models may cost over $1,000. Consider what features are most important to you.

# Reading Reviews And Recommendations

Reading reviews helps you understand the pros and cons of each model. Look for feedback on performance and durability. Recommendations from friends or online forums can be helpful. They give real-world insights and experiences.

# Essential Accessories

Learning to use an [espresso machine](https://gomehedi.com/best-espresso-machine-for-beginners/) can be exciting. There are many accessories to consider. These tools can make the process smoother. With the right equipment, you can make delicious coffee at home. Let’s explore the essential items you need.

# Grinder

The grinder is a must-have accessory. It ensures your coffee is fresh. Freshly ground beans taste better. Choose a burr grinder over a blade grinder. Burr grinders offer consistent grind size. This results in better espresso.

# Tamper

A tamper is used to pack coffee grounds. It helps create a firm puck. This ensures water flows evenly through the coffee. A good tamper fits snugly in the portafilter. Look for one with a comfortable grip.

# Milk Frother

If you enjoy milk-based drinks, a milk frother is essential. It helps create creamy foam for lattes and cappuccinos. Some espresso machines have built-in frothers. If not, consider buying a separate one. Look for a frother that is easy to clean.

# Cleaning Tools

Keeping your machine clean is important. Cleaning tools include brushes and descaling solutions. Regular cleaning extends the machine’s life. It also ensures the best tasting coffee. Follow the manufacturer’s cleaning instructions.

# Scale

A scale is useful for measuring coffee and water. Accurate measurements lead to consistent results. Look for a scale with a timer. This helps you track brewing time. It’s a small tool with a big impact.

# Setting Up Your Machine

Starting with an espresso machine can be exciting. The aroma of fresh coffee fills the air. But first, you need to set it up. Whether it’s your first time or you’re trying a new machine, understanding the basics is key. Let’s explore how to get your espresso machine ready for use.

# ${example}

Begin by reading the instruction manual. Each machine has its own quirks. Knowing them helps avoid mistakes. Ensure the machine is on a stable surface. This prevents any accidents. Stability is essential for proper functioning.

Next, check the water reservoir. Fill it with clean, cold water. Avoid using warm water. This ensures your coffee tastes fresh. Some machines have specific water requirements. Always adhere to these guidelines.

Insert the portafilter correctly. Make sure it clicks into place. A loose portafilter can affect extraction. Check the seals and gaskets. These should be tight and secure. Proper insertion ensures consistency in each cup.

Finally, test the machine with a dry run. This means running water through the system. It helps clear any dust or residue. Do not use coffee for this test. Just water, to ensure cleanliness.

# Grinding The Coffee

Learning to use an espresso machine can seem daunting at first. But with a bit of practice, it becomes much simpler. One of the key steps is grinding the coffee. A good grind can make or break your espresso. It’s important to pay attention to the details. This guide will help you understand the basics. Soon, you’ll be making delicious espresso at home.

# Grind Size Matters

Choosing the right **grind size**is very important. A fine grind is usually best for espresso. It should feel like fine sand. If the grind is too coarse, the water will pass through too quickly. This can result in a weak coffee. On the other hand, if it’s too fine, it might clog the machine. This can cause a bitter taste. Here are some tips to get it right:

* Start with a small amount of coffee.
* Test the grind size before brewing.
* Adjust based on taste and extraction time.

Using a grinder with settings can help. Experiment with different settings to find what works best. Remember, practice makes perfect. The right grind size can enhance the flavor of your espresso. Keep testing and adjusting until you find your perfect cup.

# Using Fresh Beans

**Fresh beans**are crucial for a good espresso. They should be used within two weeks of roasting. Old beans lose their flavor and aroma. When buying beans, check the roast date. Here’s a simple guide to ensure freshness:

|Bean Type|Roast Date|Best Used By|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Arabica|Within 7 days|14 days|
|Robusta|Within 5 days|10 days|

Store your beans in an airtight container. Keep them away from light and heat. This will help maintain their freshness. Use only what you need. Grind just before brewing. This ensures the best flavor and aroma in each cup.

# Tamping Techniques

Learning to use an espresso machine can be both exciting and challenging. For beginners, understanding the basics is crucial to making a perfect cup. Among these basics, tamping techniques play a key role. Tamping ensures that the coffee grounds are packed well in the portafilter. This process affects the taste and quality of your espresso. With the right tamping methods, you can enjoy a rich and flavorful espresso every time. Let’s explore some essential tamping techniques to enhance your espresso-making skills.

# Applying Even Pressure

Applying even pressure is essential for a balanced espresso shot. Uneven pressure can lead to uneven extraction. This means some parts of the coffee puck may be over-extracted while others are under-extracted. To apply even pressure, follow these steps:

* Hold the tamper firmly with your dominant hand.
* Keep your arm at a 90-degree angle for stability.
* Press down with consistent force, around 30 pounds of pressure.
* Ensure the surface of the coffee is flat and even.

Using a bathroom scale can help practice the right pressure. Consistency is key. With practice, you will develop a feel for the correct pressure. Remember, the goal is to create a uniform coffee bed for even extraction.

# Importance Of Leveling

Leveling the coffee grounds is another crucial step. Level coffee grounds prevent channeling during extraction. Channeling happens when water finds weak spots and flows through them. This results in a weak or bitter espresso shot. To ensure proper leveling, consider the following tips:

* Distribute coffee evenly before tamping.
* Use a distribution tool if available.
* Spin the portafilter gently to level the grounds.

A flat coffee bed ensures uniform water flow. This leads to a balanced extraction and a perfect espresso shot. Leveling is simple but makes a significant difference. Consistent practice will improve your tamping skills and espresso quality.

# Brewing Process

Espresso machines are a popular way to make coffee at home. They can be tricky for beginners. Understanding the brewing process is key. It involves several steps, including water temperature and extraction time. Learning these basics will help you make a delicious espresso. This guide will walk you through the process, so you can start brewing with confidence.

# Water Temperature

Water temperature is crucial for a perfect espresso. The ideal range is 195°F to 205°F. Too hot or too cold water can affect the taste. Hot water can make the coffee bitter. Cold water can result in weak flavor. It’s important to check the temperature before brewing.

Most espresso machines have a built-in thermometer. Use it to monitor the temperature. If your machine doesn’t have one, use a kitchen thermometer. Adjust the machine settings to reach the ideal temperature. Consistent temperature helps in extracting flavors properly.

Here are some tips to maintain the right temperature:

* Preheat the machine for a few minutes.
* Use fresh, cold water in the reservoir.
* Ensure the machine is clean and free from scale.

By focusing on water temperature, you can enhance the espresso taste. It’s a simple step, but very important in brewing.

1mc22kb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/1mc22kb/ghosted/,Ghosted.,"45/bi woman. Been single since 2013. Only dated 4 or 5 people in my life (if you count people in high school that you ""went out with"" but only ever saw at school.) One long term relationship. Haven't had sex since 2013. Went on a handful of first dates in 2015 but nothing ever went beyond that. Have a SA history and some mental illness so I gave myself some grace with the first 5 years of being alone. Got myself into therapy and have done a lot of work to make myself a decent person... but the mental illness will always be a thing in my life and I'm awkward socially. Not really attractive either. I have a really angry face even when I'm happy. Rejected by basically any person I ever had feelings for with the exception of my one long term ex. Anyway, its the same cycle every few years ever since I was a kid... I fall for someone, they find out I like them and get disgusted, never talk to me again, their friends side with them and I'm left with no one. Repeat. I've switched friend groups so many times in my life. No one I know now knows about the past ones except for a few people. I left college because of it. I have communities I can never show my face in again because of it. It's mortifying and embarassing to be the fugly gross woman no one wants attracted to them (sorry if that talk isn't allowed- let me know and I will edit but its the truth.) Anyways. Moved to a new city last year that I knew some folks in, and had communities for some of my hobbies. Had a friend I knew a little- not well, but we knew each other and would see each other maybe once a year, and he was always... weird around me. When he found out I'd moved to town, he was super excited about it. A little extra. We saw each other every few weeks since I got here- always hanging out a little longer each time. Always hugging a little longer each time. I suspected he might have feelings, but I always suspect people have feelings for me and they don't. But, I kept an open mind. The feelings were mutual. He had always been in the back of my mind, but I largely gave up on trying to date, and I knew it would be super unlikely that he'd actually be interested so I didn't let myself have feelings. In the spring it got more intense- he spent more time with me at social events. We started messaging on social media and he gave me his number. We texted off and on and then the last time I saw him- we hung out for hours. All of our friends left and we stayed at the bar until it closed. When we finally left, we hugged forever and he said I gave the best hugs. I had texts from him before I was even home saying how good it was to see me. We texted every day that week- from as soon as we got home from work until we went to bed. We sent pictures. He dropped a million hints about how he was ""going to dinner by himself"" and I was too afraid to say anything because I was afraid of being rejected. He told me I was hot. No one has ever told me I was hot. Finally I suggested that we should meet up sometime. We decided to meet up a few days later. We continued to talk every night. He was supposed to hang out with his friends but blew them off to talk to me all night. He started saying that I should come over... or maybe come over my place. We talked until midnight. Then the next day, he had a concert to go to, so I didnt expect texts. I texted him and told him to have fun. He sent me a picture from the show. The next day was the day before we were supposed to go out. I looked up places to go- we were only going out for coffee or drinks, nothing crazy- and I texted him to pick a time and place to meet up. He told me he had to cancel, he had a rehearsal he forgot about, but we'd get together soon. I was bummed, but he hadn't let me down so far and it seemed like an honest mistake. The guy has a lot going on so no surprise. And then I didn't hear from him again. I shot him one message to ask him how his week was, he sent me one saying it was OK and he was hanging out with a friend. And that's it. Ghosted and abandoned.

I am not surprised but I am still absolutely shattered. This was the closest I've been to a date or someone liking me in 12 years. I've never had anyone pursue me like that or tell me I was attractive in my entire life. He was absolutely adorable and smart, kind, talented and well put together and I was totally smitten. Anyways, I didnt tell anyone except my therapist and one friend that lives really far away (and I didnt even tell that person who the guy was) because we have too many mutual friends and I couldn't let it ruin the rest of my friendships. I'm mortified that someone will find out. So none of our friends know (unless he's told anyone.) You folks reading this are the only folks that know the details. I can only assume he found out about the mental health issues, or the fact that i haven't been with anyone in 12 years, or just put on his glasses and came to his senses and realized I was fucking gross. It's all fine, he has no trouble dating and will go on about his life, and I don't blame him. But I'm crushed and I'm just grieving the fact that love and relationships are just things that I won't ever get to experience ever again. I lost that with my ex (who i honestly dont think ever actually loved me.) The ups and downs of this have been so hard for me- the emotions are just extremes and its been a roller-coaster and I can't put myself through this again. I fight bipolar disorder and anxiety on a good day- this is just too much. The highs and lows are exhausting and its unhealthy for this to affect me so hard. And I'm just embarrassed by it all- how could I be so stupid to think he liked me? I just feel like an idiot and im beating myself up over it and I'm too ashamed to tell anyone else.

Why do you have me suspended in this spellbound thought that maybe we saw each other…

Don’t get me wrong others have seen me but not in this state of physical Energy.


So are you going to distance yourself and remain safe……or are you going to allow the Sapphire Flames lure you in.

Will you be excited to see me like the last time?

Will you reject my invitation or accept it without hesitation.

Will my mouth let me speak or will my younger be held.

Will I break the curse upon me and express my gratitude towards your kindness making me laugh and smile being physically present making it known by always showing up.


So I’ve had more time to think about this.


It’s so smooth and comfortable when we talk.

I didn’t go seeking you out like I normally do.

You didn’t make me chase you….you met me halfway….

It seems we both have an interest and are both very respectful of each other’s boundaries….i like that I don’t feel the ball in either court it’s not a 1v1.

I had asked about your neckless thinking that it was Sumerian but you corrected me then it was just a nice conversation while I got my coffee….then slowly it was more and more conversation and then Mr.C became a great guy? 

That makes me wonder why? What makes you believe or think that?

💭 does that hold any weight? Or is it just a friendly comment? Why tell coworkers that Mr.C is a great guy??

Why get off the ladder you had been on for something I didn’t look I noticed you from the corner of my eye and didn’t want to be that guy then BOOM 💥 your out the window chatting it up.🥰

God knows my Pisces ass eats that attention up since it’s been so long anyone’s shown physical activity you show up in person every time I come through, you make your presence known and it follows it’s with own Energy that’s very electric! 🥵 I don’t think you’re just pretty or just beautiful.

I see you and I see someone unique someone elegant someone Extraordinary.


I would say you’re awesome but that’s lame to say.

I would say amazing but that seems like it’s too weak.

So extraordinarily extravagant seem to fit.


You melted my ass when you started sticking your tongue 😛 out at my son…..🥰😱🤤 again I’ve said it before but I don’t know what one hits harder because.


First that’s mini me.
My daughter isn’t my wingwoman she’s way way too social 🙃

My son doesn’t like people and he got super excited to see you and to see you playing with him when you didn’t have to do even acknowledge him…that still rides my thoughts hourly damn.

As a Pisces it really makes a difference.


So just know I really respect and appreciate you while I’d love to get to know you more and spend time with you even just talking I don’t want to damage anything I don’t want to give you a damaged heart to hold.

While I believe you might be the one who has the best luck at healing those wounds.

I can only speculate on my observations and my own feelings.

You show up every time I come through you stop come out and we talk for however long that might be.

You acknowledged my son….nothing made you do that but your own free will…

You’ve made me laugh and smile and I see you smile and laugh every time we talk….

So if you’re willing to take that leap of faith I won’t hold you as tight as anyone before I will let you choose how close you want to come and how tightly to be held.

I’ll see you again if it’s written so we shall see how the story goes.


God knows I’m not writing it.

Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron. — 1 TIMOTHY 4:2
 
Keep a tender conscience — don’t violate it — because it is your conscience, the voice of your spirit, that relates to your mind what the spirit of God is saying to you down inside. If you don’t keep a tender conscience, spiritual things will not be clear to you.

During the mid-’30s, I pastored a country church and usually spent Sunday nights in the home of a dear old gentleman who was about eighty-nine years old. He and I didn’t get up as early as the rest of his family on this farm, so we had breakfast together about 8 o’clock. He’d have one of those old-fashioned coffee pots sitting on the woodstove with the coffee just boiling in it. I’ve seen him pour that boiling coffee into a mug, hold it up to his mouth, and drink the whole cup of boiling coffee in one gulp. The first time I saw him do it, I felt like I was burning all the way down!

How could he do that? I certainly couldn’t do it. My mouth and throat are so tender, one teaspoon of boiling coffee would have burned me. He couldn’t do it either, to begin with. But through the years, drinking boiling coffee had seared this man’s lips, mouth, and throat, until it was easy for him to drink the whole cup of boiling coffee in one gulp.

The same thing can happen spiritually. Keep a tender conscience. Stop the minute you miss it and your conscience condemns you. Say, “Lord, forgive me. I missed it.” Or if you need to, tell someone you have wronged, “I did wrong. Please forgive me.”
 
Confession:
I keep my conscience tender.
