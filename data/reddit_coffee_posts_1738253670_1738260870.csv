1idtdf5,https://v.redd.it/imdimdjn96ge1,Bought used La Marzocco. Loud contractor noise,"Hi folks,

I just bought La Marzocco Linea Classic AV 3 group used.
Upon the installation, I could hear this heavy clicking contractor noise twice per minute. 

The seller says I can do nothing about this but would like to know anyone who experienced this and solved this issue.

This is too loud that the whole coffee shop can hear this and it’s frustrating.

If you have anything to share, I would appreciate it!

I wouldn't have believed it before...

Today I received my Eureka Mignon Specialita coffee grinder.
So first I put my Sage/Breville Smart Grinder Pro grinder to one side and put the new boss, the Specialita, in its place.
So far, the espresso my wife and I have made with the SGP in conjunction with the Dedica 685 has actually tasted quite good. 

Then I shredded about 100g of beans in the Eureka to find the right grind level and then suddenly...THE PERFECT SHOT.
16.5g of fresh, dark roasted beans in, 41g out in 27 seconds.

The espresso in the cup tasted like it was prepared by God himself and suddenly I can taste ""dark chocolate"" and ""nut"" - as it says on the bean packet.
Perfect balance between acidity and bitterness.
How often have I heard in videos that the particle distribution of the Specialita is really good (blah blah blah) compared to the SGP coffee grinder, but that it can make such a difference - unbelievable.

...............................................................................................................................................

As of sharing this it’s been about a week since the events I’m going to describe have happened. I’ll be honest, my attempt at documenting the experience has somewhat spiralled but I fear going back and editing anything may risk wasting the limited window I have before My friend is long gone, so here goes.

Hello everyone, my name’s Mounia and I live in Beyrouth, Lebanon. It’s usually unwise to dox your location online, but I’m at my wit’s end and If I have any chance of finding Hala again, I need to ask for help. 

Last tuesday very late at night I got a series of SMS messages from a masked number that read the following:

*“Mounia* 

*it’s Hala*

*kidnapped* 

*find diaries”* 

setting aside my instinct telling me this was some random attempt at a scam, we do live in a somewhat tumultuous country so i decided it was best to be sure. Hala is a weirdo comic artist and has been for most of her life as you’ll see in a bit, so I’m used to getting weird messages at random times. case in point: one time she called me at 2 in the morning and played the audio of king Ramzes saying “return the slab” from that one episode of courage the cowardly dog. With that in mind you can probably understand my reasoning when I got that message at 4 am and her phone rang with no answer, I assumed this was some sort of weird joke or maybe she’d fallen asleep. 

Regardless, this is the kind of thing you don’t cry wolf about, and even if someone did, you would deep down still take it seriously. The next day I tried calling again, nothing. I was really getting worried since I know she wakes up every day at 7 sharp if not before; this was always a point of contention between us. Hala isn’t the type to ignore calls or messages for longer than an hour, she’d always at least text saying she’d get back to you. As the day went by I tried to go about my business routinely checking her *last seen*, I even stalked her likes tab on Tumblr for the entire day. She still uses it obsessively and stayed on the website even when they changed the guidelines in 2017. It stayed the same all day, and I knew for a fact that she browsed it frequently because she had a habit of sending people links to posts at any and all times. 

As the evening rolled by I was getting really worked up over the fact that the messages I sent that day had not been received, and calling via all methods only revealed her phone was off. I tried to reassure myself that maybe she’s taking the day off, but eventually around the evening I figured it would be better to make a fool of myself than to standby and do nothing: I called common friends of ours, no one had heard from her since the morning of the day before. Her apartment was two hours by car away from mine so at 6 am the next day I took the bus and around 9 am I knocked on her door and was greeted with dry silence. I have a spare key that she gave me a while back, so I opened the door and walked in.

Her apartment was spotless. Everything was exceptionally clean, and on the table where she usually keeps her inks and paints strewn about around whichever project she’s working on all the plastic palettes were pristine, even brand new looking. The watercolor boxes were closed and neatly tidied up, the nibs wiped clean of the thick staining ink and not a spot of paint was anywhere. the wooden table had been scrubbed so well that the varnish had been stripped off. In the main room where she usually keeps all her artwork hung up to dry was sticky tack residue all across the walls with the drawings crumpled up in a pile overflowing from a bin on the floor. The window was open and the curtains fluttered in the breeze.  Walking in, I felt compelled to try not to make noise. The floor had been cleaned so aggressively the tiles were no longer smooth, instead walking felt like styrofoam rubbing against itself. I checked the bedrooms, thinking she went somewhere, but all her bags and luggage were stacked on top of the closet. None of the hangers or drawers had empty spots as far as i could tell, all the clothes were uncharacteristically folded up into neat squares and positioned on top of each other like a staircase so that you could see all the colors at a glance. They felt hard to the touch, as if someone had carved statues to mimic the clothes in hala’s drawer. 

Even the dishes were done and put away. Hala *hates* doing dishes. The closed rooms smelled like the detergent they used in hospitals. Did she hire a cleaning company? she wasn’t the kind to afford that kind of luxury. She’s a broke freelance illustrator who does comic books in her spare time. 

I thought to check my phone again, and browsed to the message I got from the anonymous number as I showed myself out. 

*“Mounia* 

*it’s Hala*

*kidnapped* 

*find diaries”*  

Later that day a missing person report was filed with the police. I hear a lot online about how useless the police are in America, and I can assure they’re just as useless here but it never hurts to bet on a losing dog when the only other option is to run around the track yourself. They seemed interested when I described the state of the apartment and mentioned that usually someone would call asking for a ransom. A day later, the police showed up, saw her apartment and promptly did nothing. So I decided my best option, to not say the only one, was to look into the diary thing. The message did specify finding them and I had done my job of showing the officer… But when they didn’t find any diaries anywhere in the apartment they seem to have dropped that idea. Or maybe they didn’t, who am I to discredit them automatically; all I know is that no one said anything to me the entire duration they were present.

I’ve known Hala most of my life and she’s kept diaries for as long as I can remember. The anonymous message specifically said “diaries” in plural form which requires more letters to type. So if she was presumably in a hurry, which I think she was based on the brief one word messages outlining keywords, she meant more than one at the very least. There were definitely some still at her parent’s house, and as uncomfortable and dreadful as the idea of subjecting myself to misgendering and deadnaming was, Hala had been my ride or die for years. After juggling guilt and shame for yet another evening I eventually caved and put on the plainest, most dude gym bro looking clothes I could muster, deepened my voice an uncomfortable amount and at 11 AM of the third day since Hala’s disappearance I headed to the old house.

Much to my luck, they’re both senile and assumed I was a new friend. No one had told them their daughter was missing for some reason which is very strange, but I sure as hell was not about to be the bringer of bad news so I proudly pretended to be called Wissam, and said I was a friend of Hala’s from work looking for her old diary. They told me to wait and closed the door.  A minute later her father came back holding a cell phone. he pointed the phone at me and said “here, you ask him”

The voice over the phone sounded identical to Hala.

“hey hey! how’s it going?”

But something about the choice of words felt off. No mention of being missing, her phone being off for two days, everyone being worried. Moreso, it was safe to assume her father at least *mentioned* some random guy at the door asking about her diary. It felt ridiculous but I threw out a hail mary. 

“hey Hala been a minute! how’s *\[my deadname\]*?”

there was a pause. “Good… good.”

hell no. hell to the no.

“Thanks for finding my diaries for me, could you drop them off at my apartment?”

That wasn’t her. she would never say that. never in a million years. She knows the voice I’m pretending to use right now, she knows I would never come here willingly. that’s not Hala.

“hello? you still there?”

“oh yeah, uh, sure, I’m not sure it’s here anyway so if you don’t find it at your door that’s why”

I wasn’t about to lure whoever this was to her parent’s house.

“Let him in, he’s fine” the voice said as the semi busted speaker on her father’s phone crackled.

We have a code for this. Growing up one of our favourite jokes from a show was “peanut butter egg dirt” from scrubs. The idea that you could read someone’s mind so well that you could predict random words was very amusing to us. So we decided we would have our own just to be able to make that joke to new people. it would be “purple walrus alarm”. Eventually as we both grew up the expression became our angel shot. We’d been using it up until a couple of months ago when someone roofied me in a bar. “purple walrus alarm” would be a book, a joke, a drink, a story, whatever it needed to be to fit into the conversation. sometimes we’d truncate it and give shortened versions of it, and it still got the job done. if someone was pointing a gun to her head and she had to make it sound casual, she’d slide in a reference to “purple walrus alarm” somewhere. but she didn’t. why?

I knew exactly where to look. her father showed me how to get to the memories they could afford to forget and I pretended to follow along as he guided me to the attic. Eventually, he was done talking and left me to look for the notebook. It occurred to me how nonchalant they were about this, but now wasn’t the time for that. With any luck, her childhood room still had what I was looking for. Her parents always gave her a lot of freedom to do what she wanted in her room within reason, since she was rarely allowed to leave the house other than to go to school. 

As I cracked open the door, I was greeted with a sight that made the air smell like cheap popping candy and cold cigarette smoke. It was much smaller than I remembered, and the pink shag carpet still had the same neon glow that it once did all those years ago. The only two things in the room were the bed and a large wardrobe with two swinging doors and three drawers at the bottom. The walls still had the same posters Hala sloppily tacked on when she was 14, bending outward and damaged from years of sun exposure. the headboard was very dusty, looking closer I could tell by the thick layer of dust under the bed that it hadn’t been moved. I smiled. 

Behind the bed I could see a large cork board with pictures and drawings. One of them was a doodle of us from a different time. I thought for a moment whether or not to take it as I moved the board aside. Behind the board was a hole in the wall roughly 50 by 30 cm in size (that’s 19 by 11 inches for you imperial folk). This gap in the cinderblock wall served as a cheerful reminder of how little attention some parents pay to their kids. 

We referred to this hole as the “secret passage” despite it being not big enough to fit a person. It led to a space between this house and the neighbor’s, who at the time had a kid named Claude. She was a very short scrawny kid that we all towered over even as 10 year olds, and we affectionately referred to her as hercules because of how confident she was. Claude was the only person skinny enough to fit through the hole comfortably, and would often come into Hala’s room at night to hang out. I remember when we first made the hole. We spent an entire Saturday afternoon walking up and down the stairs, sneaking up and down lugging small bags of pebbles we chipped off the wall. The downstairs neighbors were renovating at the time, and we used the noises as a way to hide that we were smashing  huge chunks out of the walls.

God, I’m rambling. sorry. I reached in and with some effort- and a lot of future neck pain that i would come to regret the next day- I was able to find two very dusty notebooks wrapped in a thick black garbage bag.

I couldn’t find anything else and besides, Hala had probably scrubbed this room of any evidence of wrongdoings when she moved out some years ago. she probably forgot these even existed in all honesty. I stood up, put everything back where I found it and decided to take the small doodle from the corkboard. it was too tempting not to and being in this room had renewed my worry for where Hala might be. [here it is.](https://halaismissing.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20250128_174712.jpg?w=2048)

I closed the door behind me. The next 4 hours were spent digging through boxes, and I found nothing of note. Just a lot of junk, honestly. I hid the notebooks under my hoodie and walked back into the living room pretending to not have found anything.

Below you’ll find scans of the journal with added context by me. 

[***entry 1: this is a journal  (click to see scans)***](https://tapas.io/episode/3234905)

When we were kids, the only time we really got to see each other was during recess. I had the freedom to leave the house whenever I wanted, which was good since after my mother’s death, being in the house was insufferable. One of the things I did for fun back then was climbing, and since there aren’t that many trees in the suburbs I took to climbing trucks, buildings, stop signs, electric poles, balconies, you name it. Frequently in our group of overachieving 10 year old delinquents the job of surveillance was given to me since i could have a bird eye’s view in a short amount of time. In later years Hala would confess her long standing guilt for asking me to climb all those dangerous places, but I maintain that it was worth it. 

When I first met Hala we had recently moved into our then new house. The building has now been demolished and with good reason, it was awful. I’m pretty sure my father rented that house because it was the only one he could afford. Or maybe he was cheap, I’m not too sure really. Point is, I was lonely and scared and something about her felt safe. I remember one day I climbed up to her balcony and we chatted through the metal bars for what seemed like five minutes that just couldn’t be long enough. 

On this particular day, we had made a plan to pool together our cash and buy a particular kind of jawbreakers that had popping candy at its core. The idea was to trade them for things and favors at school. It was too dark to climb, so the plan was I’d sneak out of my house and have the candy in my backpack as I climbed up to Hala’s balcony. There was a hole in our plan though, it’s not like we could have planned for every eventuality: I lost my keys. I never told hala this, and reading her version of the story where my father was involved in a made up sense of urgency felt uncanny.

Standing in front of my door, I wondered what he would do. I thought of all the times my friends would ask me why I wouldn’t play with them, why I was walking funny on some days. I remember putting my hand up against my other arm and legitimately wondering if he’d even notice I wasn’t there. He never woke up in time for me to go to school anyway. That day I, in fact, did not go to school. I ran to my grandma’s house and begged her to let me in with tears gushing down my face. I never told her the entire truth and I don’t know why she showed me that much kindness. Either way, God rest her soul. That woman is the reason I’m alive.

[***entry 2: maps (click to see scans)***](https://tapas.io/episode/3243212)

Hala was always the best of us. while far from architectural, these are some fairly accurate maps to some extent. the attic i was in is a small room accessible by ladder positioned on top of the bathroom.

For one, I can confirm that all these people do in fact exist. Most of them (with the exception of Claude) have been given aliases by Hala so I will keep referring to them using those aliases out of respect for their privacy and to avoid confusion. 

some additions:

* It’s mentioned that we never knew Claude’s parents. this is true. for the longest time we kept picking on her to introduce us to her parents but for some reason she kept refusing. one night. during a sleepover, we heard a quiet, deep mechanical hum coming from the secret tunnel. naturally because we were a bunch of stupid 10 year olds, we all crawled under and over the bed to listen closely. it stopped for a moment and we heard the sound of something scratching, followed by a loud bang. We all started screaming and Hala’s parents came in running. when we told them what had happened, they went into Claude’s house and came back saying there was nothing to worry about. Apparently a lightbulb had exploded due to a power surge. Claude stayed at Hala’s house for a couple of days and a while later we learned that one of the neighborhood kids (someone we didn’t know) had gone missing along side Claude’s dog foofi. 

When we were 17, Claude told everyone she was a foster kid. I realized then she’d been hiding it out of shame. Both Toni and her had been living with an elderly man. Apparently, what had happened that night was that the elderly man had come into the room with some sort of machine, and shot foofi right in front of Toni. Justifiably terrified, Toni ran away and was never seen again. At the time, we were told he got adopted but Claude found out what actually happened when she reached out to the people who put her in foster care in an attempt to get in touch with Toni. She also found out that she was put into the care of Hala’s parents, who, having known about the “secret tunnel” and the old man’s negligence, had already been doing most of the work on his behalf anyway. They even went as far as to pay for Claude’s tuition. Why they didn’t just let her move into Hala’s house is extremely odd to me. It’s not like they were desperate to nurture their daughter’s sense of adventure, and any reasonable adult would *WANT* to plug up their daughter’s sketchy hole in the wall she uses to hide stuff. This is not even to mention the fact that they chose to leave Claude in the vicinity of the same man who nearly shot another kid by accident. I felt like this needed to be pointed out on account of how genuinely weird it is. It’s possible I may be misremembering, but I’m trying my best to be diligent.

* In the section about Talbas, it’s true that we rarely saw her mom. Even less so Hala on account of never being allowed to leave the house. She only ever saw people’s parents on occasions, when they picked their kids up from school or in pictures. Both of Talbas’s parents were pretty absent for most of the day. they worked full time jobs and supposedly had been saving up for something. that’s at least what they told everyone whenever asked what they’d been doing with all the extra income. something else worth noting: her parents didn’t like her uncle one bit. the grandma obviously did because it’s her son, but there was something very tense about the relationship of the father and the uncle that never seemed to show up the way you’d expect. you hear a lot about brothers arguing over inheritance, or maybe getting split up over long standing arguments but this wasn’t like that. it seemed to be a sort of seething, low burning hatred that kept them from each other like the identical sides of magnets.

[***entry 4: Talbas’s comic (click to see scans)***](https://tapas.io/episode/3250307)

I have nothing to point out in what concerns the comic itself. it’s pretty on par for what you might expect from a 10 year old. If anything it highlights how clever of a kid Hala was. Around the time of when Talbas made the installments of her comic which you’ll see later, Hala and I frequently heard her fighting with her parents. Talbas is a naturally loud person, still is to a lesser degree. We never told her that we knew but apparently her parents kept comparing her to Hala, saying how better she is in school and how much more interesting of a person she was growing into. setting aside how cruel that is to say to a child, let alone your own, it’s easy to see why Talbas wanted to make her own comic as well. during a particularly heated discussion one time, talbas yelled “if you hate me so much, why don’t you just send me to boarding school like bata’s brother?!”

there was a sudden silence. We couldn’t hear anything after that. We never asked, but we guessed by the things she’d draw in her comic after loud fights that it was a touchy subject for her.

[***entry 5: C.O.O.P (click to see scans)***](https://tapas.io/episode/3262974)

The Lady referred to in the comic, “Sint Khashbe” (which is a made up arabic pun name that means very old) would often stand on her balcony and watch the people go by late at night. since she was within earshot, neighbors would often ask her why she wasn’t doing anything else and she’d always reply with how she enjoyed being outside. for some reason, that seemed deeply upsetting for my father and Talbas’s parents, who would occasionally pick fights with her, accusing her of being nosy. I never got what that was all about. 

When she died I remember going up to the floor her house was on and seeing a crowd of people pouring in. Entering felt like walking into someone’s diary, where each person was a pen syphoning the still wet ink to write their own reconstruction of who the lost was. I remember seeing Hala’s mom leaning down and kissing the old lady on her forehead, right before touching it the way you would when checking someone’s temperature. I knew it had to feel cold. from inside the room I could hear someone say

“close the door, don’t let the boy see. *Haram*” 

There are very few expressions that can properly capture the significance of that word. stuck between empathy and compassion, Haram is the lifeline you throw at someone when you don’t want them to get hurt, but can’t really help it. like watching an animal die on television, or coming across your dead neighbor when you knock on their door to have your morning coffee together. *Haram.* That’s how I always felt about it at least. 

some months later, a family moved into the now vacant apartment.

You're probably going to do some quest that involves clearing a POI. But generally you're going to be out in the world, among a bunch of lootable and harvestable stuff, and as always, zombies will be out and about.

What's on your hotbar, and how much of your inventory comes pre-occupied with supplies? How much does it change in later game stages?

My standard carry usually looks like this:

Hotbar:

- 1: Pickaxe

- 2: Axe

- 3: Sledge (or primary melee)

- 4: Shovel

- 5: Shotgun (or primary gun)

- 6: Salvage Tool

- 7: Knife 

- 8: Repairing Tool

- 9: Stack of Building Blocks

- 10: Empty (fists) (it's probably silly, but I don't like using tool durability when harvesting stuff like plants)

In my inventory I usually run the following:

- Stack of stone (It has a few misc uses, and I usually get some in small quantities from a bunch of random things anyway, so it would be a hassle to keep my inventory completely stone-free)

- Stack of Wood (Misc uses, wind up collecting small amounts anyway)

- Stack of plant fiber (Misc uses, wind up collecting small amounts anyway)

- Shotgun AP slugs (or ammo for ranged weapon)

- Repair Kits

- Stack of good food

- Stack of good water

- Partial stack of First Aid bandages (leaves room to loot a few more without using more space)

- Partial Stack of Honey (Don't want to have to pass up a stump because I don't have space)

- Lockpicks

- Nerd Outfit (I equip it before reading books, then switch back.)

- Blackstrap Coffee (I probably don't need this for everyday stuff, but sometimes I have a little time to kill after a quest, and there's an ore node nearby)

That's 12/45 inventory spaces and 9/10 hotbar slots used, before I even loot my first container.

Early game, the stone axe doubles as a pickaxe and as the repair tool, so I didn't need those.

There's a bunch of other random stuff I keep wanting to bring along. Other ammo types, special drinks, random materials, but I usually avoid anything else so I can loot more.",1,1738259977.0,7daystodie,0,1.0,False

Enter the HUANUO HNESD27B Electric Standing Desk—a desk that promised to save my spine and bring some ergonomic sanity back into my life. After putting it to the test for a couple of weeks, I can definitely say I’ve found a lot to love, but there are a few quirks worth noting.

**Design & Build Quality**  
This desk is a modern minimalist’s dream. The black laminated finish looks sleek and professional, and the carbon steel base feels incredibly sturdy. I’ve had desks before that wobbled at the slightest touch, but this one stays firmly rooted, even during its height transitions. The two drawers are a useful touch, perfect for stashing away clutter like cables or notebooks. However, the faux-wood grain on the surface might not be everyone’s cup of tea—my partner called it “50% chic, 50% office furniture from the ‘90s.” Still, I think it gives a nice contrast to the matte black legs.

Find the best [price for HUANUO on Amazon.](https://decorgurus.com/product-reviews/huanuo-hnesd27b-electric-standing-desk-review-with-features-analysis/)

**Size & Space**  
With its 48” x 24” surface, this desk comfortably fits my dual-monitor setup, keyboard, mouse, and even a little space for my coffee mug (or snacks). The curved ergonomic edge is a surprisingly nice feature that allows me to sit closer without feeling cramped. That said, if you’re someone with a larger gaming or work setup, you might find the space a tad limiting. It’s ideal for medium-sized spaces like home offices or even classrooms, as advertised.

**Functionality & Features**  
The standout feature here is the electric height adjustment. You can smoothly transition between 27.5 inches and 46.4 inches with the touch of a button. I’ve been using the preset memory buttons (there are four!) to switch between sitting and standing heights throughout the day. It’s quiet too, so I don’t feel like I’m announcing my height adjustment to the entire neighborhood.

The C-Clamp mount compatibility on the rear platform is a lifesaver for anyone using a monitor arm. I mounted mine easily, and it keeps my workspace looking clean and organized. The desk also has hooks on the side for headphones or bags—a feature I didn’t think I needed until I started using it daily.

**Assembly**  
Assembling this desk was not the nightmare I anticipated. The instructions were clear, and all the necessary tools were included. It took me about an hour, with my roommate lending a hand to hold parts in place. A word of advice: pay attention to the orientation of the small pieces that support the raised surface; the labels can be misleading.

**Pros**

* Sturdy carbon steel frame ensures no wobbling, even at maximum height.
* Smooth and quiet electric height adjustments with memory presets.
* Includes two functional drawers and side hooks for organized storage.
* Ergonomic curved edge enhances comfort during long work sessions.
* Compatible with C-Clamp monitor mounts, adding versatility.

**Cons**

* Surface finish might not appeal to those who dislike faux-wood designs.
* Presets can be finicky at times and may not always work seamlessly.
* Limited workspace for larger setups requiring more room.
* Assembly instructions could use clearer labeling for certain components.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
Compared to standing desks from brands like FlexiSpot or Vari, the HUANUO HNESD27B stands out for its affordability without sacrificing too much on quality. While Vari desks might offer a more premium finish and higher weight capacity, they come at a significantly steeper price. FlexiSpot desks, on the other hand, offer comparable electric height adjustments but often lack the thoughtful extras like the ergonomic edge and built-in drawers.

That said, one area where HUANUO could improve is the motor’s speed. It’s a bit slower than competitors like Fully Jarvis, which might not matter to everyone but could frustrate those who frequently adjust height. Still, the quieter motor on the HUANUO desk might win over users who value a peaceful workspace.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
While I can’t quote exact pricing, the HUANUO HNESD27B offers an impressive suite of features for its price range. You’re getting a solidly-built electric standing desk with additional storage, ergonomic design, and versatile compatibility. It’s a great investment if you’re looking to improve your work-from-home setup or reduce strain from prolonged sitting. For those on a tighter budget, it’s a worthy contender against pricier alternatives.

The desk does come with a few trade-offs, like a slightly slower motor and some aesthetic quirks, but considering its functionality and build quality, it’s worth every penny.

I didn't look at this apartment before moving, I move last minute cause of girl job, and I don't have a lot of money to be taking this up with law or anything. Well so I let it go. Quick side note we dealt with the same thing last year before moving but it was the opposite old building and downstairs neighbors would bitch. They eventually move and we ended up moving cause of the floor creeks. Last saturday night when I got off work I came back(half drunk and food sick) Im a cook at a bar. They were throwing a party overhead real bad and my girl ask me to complain and which I said yes. I tell her in my state Im going to sleep cause I feel awful so I pop meds and knock out. She calls the cops twice and doesn't ask to speak with her first or anything so no police report from that night at all. We had video so we went up to the front office and they said ""we will handle it and apologize for the inconvenience"". Now the follow morning after the complaint she makes the loudest noise every start the old coffee maker, does a super load of laundry(has the washer banging cause she put a shit ton in there), banging around in the restroom all at 630am. Now Im just stress and paranoid in this shitting overprice place watch them damage some of my property and I don't have no money to fix it, police don't do shit in my area, NOW I feel paranoid they listen in my conversation. This feels like it all stems from the neighbors that live from my old apartment cause they keyed my car and use to bang my floor in my old apartment and the cops didn't do shit. Now Im over here stressing that's it's a repeat thing and I didn't pick my battle wisely cause of it. Honestly it's not her fault but at the same time I took into consideration her safety and I had let it go. Now idk what to do and I can't afford to buy protection(Highly probably shouldn't in my current state). I don't like conflict and I hate how I feel weak asf to deal with, haven't threw hands in years, don't own a gun cause I can't justify it, and I only fucking run so Idk.

My wife and I recently visited Japan on our way to a destination wedding. As a budding coffee enthusiast, I had one Tokyo café high on my list—Glitch Coffee, a well-known specialty coffee roaster. Unfortunately, when we arrived, we were met with a long line. After waiting for about five minutes, it was clear we’d be standing there for the better part of an hour. With limited time in Tokyo, we decided to move on to our next planned stop. While I was disappointed, it didn’t take away from an incredible day in a city unlike any other I’ve experienced as a Westerner.

Due to our itinerary, we couldn’t fit in another visit to Glitch. A few days later, I flew out to meet up with the other groomsmen for the bachelor party in another country, while my wife stayed behind to join the bridesmaids in Japan for their bachelorette party. She spent an extra day in Tokyo before heading to Osaka with the group.

Then, to my surprise, the very next day I got a notification that our shared credit card had been used at Glitch!

My wonderful, loving wife had made the trip back, braved the line, and not only tried some of their coffee but also picked up two jars to bring home for me. One of them is what I brewed today.

 

**The Coffee**

This particular coffee, grown in Nicaragua, is of the Geisha variety, known for its tea-like profile. Geisha is a rare coffee that produces significantly lower yields compared to more common varieties. This specific batch was grown at Los Alpes Farm in the Nueva Segovia region of Nicaragua and even won the 2023 Cup of Excellence for the country.

Unlike most modern coffee, which is washed-processed, this one was naturally processed, meaning the beans were dried inside the coffee cherry rather than being de-pulped from the cherry before drying. Neither process is inherently better, but natural processing typically results in fruitier flavors, whereas washed beans highlight more of the coffee’s inherent characteristics.

Glitch roasted these beans to a light roast, with jasmine tea, grape, and floral as their tasting notes. And yes, my dear wife spent $53.87 for just 50g of these beans—which comes out to $26.94 per the 25g used in the cup I brewed.

 

**The Brew**

I brewed this coffee using a 1:16 ratio of beans to water (25g to 400g) with my OXO 8-cup coffee maker. As it was brewing, I was immediately hit with a sweet, tea-like aroma.

After letting it cool slightly, I took my first sip and was blown away. The jasmine tea notes were immediately present, followed by a slight tartness of grape in the middle, and ending with a floral aftertaste. Wow. I was genuinely impressed that every single note from the roaster’s tasting description was clearly distinguishable.

While I normally drink my coffee black, I have no doubt that even someone who typically adds cream and sugar would enjoy this one straight. It truly tasted like no other coffee I’ve had before.

 

**Was It Worth It?**

$27 for one cup? Maybe? If you factor in the unique experience and the sentimental value of my wife’s effort, then absolutely. But based on price alone? No.

As with any hobby, specialty coffee is a game of diminishing returns, and I’ll admit this crossed the point where you’re paying exponentially more for marginal improvements. In fact, the other jar my wife brought back was another Geisha variety, but from Colombia, which cost $7.56 per 25g—and I actually liked that one more. It had notes of grapefruit and ginger that resonated better with my palate.

Both were amazing, but in hindsight, there was no real need to splurge on ultra-expensive beans. That said, I loved the experience, and for that, I have no regrets.

If you’re ever in Tokyo, I highly recommend checking out Glitch Coffee. While pricey, they are true masters of their craft.

1idsqgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1idsqgb/cuisinart_dcc3400p1_review_is_this_12cup_coffee/,Cuisinart DCC-3400P1 review is this 12-cup coffee maker worth it?,"Being a coffee lover, I’ve tried several coffee makers over the years, but the Cuisinart DCC-3400P1 caught my attention due to its sleek stainless steel design and programmable features. Testing it daily over the last month has given me plenty of time to form an opinion. Spoiler alert: It brews a great cup of coffee, but the experience isn't flawless.

**Design & Build Quality**

The Cuisinart DCC-3400P1 looks modern with its stainless steel finish, fitting well with other appliances in my kitchen. Its build feels solid, and the thermal carafe is a nice touch, keeping coffee hot for hours without the need for a warming plate. However, the cord is ridiculously short—it barely reaches my wall outlet. This coffee maker is lightweight, which is good for portability but slightly concerning for long-term durability. The buttons are easy to press, but I’ve read that some users experienced issues with them becoming unresponsive over time. I’m being extra gentle to make sure they last.

**Brewing Performance**

This machine delivers where it matters most, brewing hotter coffee than most drip coffee makers I’ve tried. The 12-cup thermal carafe is a lifesaver for keeping coffee at a drinkable temperature for 2-4 hours. I tested the bold brew setting, and it really does enhance the flavor, especially with darker roasts. The brewing process is relatively quick, taking about 10-12 minutes for a full pot. However, the carafe design makes pouring slow and requires you to fully tilt it to get the last drops of coffee.

**Coffee Flavor**

I’m picky when it comes to flavor, and the Cuisinart DCC-3400P1 didn’t disappoint. The coffee tastes smooth, rich, and never burnt, thanks to the absence of a warming plate. Even hours after brewing, the flavor holds up. The brew strength control allows you to switch between regular and bold, which is great for accommodating everyone’s preferences in my household.

**Cleaning & Maintenance**

Cleaning this machine is straightforward. It has a self-clean function, which I’ve already used once, and the removable parts are dishwasher-safe. The gold-tone filter is reusable, but I still prefer using paper filters for easier cleanup. The water reservoir is a bit tricky to fill, especially if you’re using the carafe—spillage is almost guaranteed unless you use a separate pitcher.

**Pros**

1. The thermal carafe keeps coffee hot for hours without altering the taste.
2. Brew strength control for tailored coffee flavors.
3. Easy-to-use programmable features like auto-on and auto-shutoff.
4. Sleek stainless steel design that complements modern kitchens.
5. Self-clean function simplifies maintenance.

**Cons**

1. Short power cord limits where you can place the coffee maker.
2. Carafe pours slowly—patience is required to avoid spills.
3. Buttons might wear out with heavy use.
4. The machine is slightly bulky, taking up more counter space than expected.
5. The charcoal water filter isn’t included in the package, which feels like an oversight.

**Comparison to Competitors**

The Cuisinart DCC-3400P1 holds its ground against competitors like the Breville Precision Brewer and the Technivorm Moccamaster. While the Moccamaster is renowned for its brewing precision, it lacks the programmability that the Cuisinart offers. The Breville, on the other hand, provides more brewing modes but comes at a significantly higher price. The DCC-3400P1 strikes a balance between affordability, programmability, and coffee quality, though it could improve in the design department, especially with its awkward carafe.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

The price of the Cuisinart DCC-3400P1 is reasonable for the features it offers. You’re getting a programmable coffee maker with a thermal carafe that keeps your coffee hot for hours—a feature that’s typically reserved for higher-end models. While some minor design flaws exist, the quality of the coffee and the convenience of programmable settings make it a worthwhile investment. Just be prepared to spend a little extra on accessories like replacement water filters or additional paper filters.

**Features Tested and Loved**

The auto-brew function has been a lifesaver on busy mornings. Setting it up the night before means I wake up to fresh coffee without lifting a finger. The 1-4 cup setting is perfect for my solo coffee breaks, ensuring the flavor remains strong even with smaller batches. The backlit LCD display is easy to read, even when I’m half-asleep. The brew-pause feature is another win—I can sneak a cup mid-brew without making a mess.

Thats pretty much everything I own coffee related. I want to know what tools or items you may think Im missing that I should look into, or if something made your routine infinitely easier or better. I know some things Im looking into getting is a new scale, and possibly a grinder.

1. Hindi is the most prominent language. People have the tendency to speak in hindi all across the office. It's wild spread from just random ""coffee chats"" to even ""official meetings"". The meetings starts with ""Hi, how are you"" and then moves on to have the whole meeting in hindi. The majority of the employees being from North India have a good hold on hindi, while people from south struggle a lot unable to keep up with the fluency grammar and speed. No matter how much we learn, we wouldn't be able to speak like a native speaker and crack jokes making people laugh. The major problem here is unable to bond and create a friend circle with your colleagues and boss. Most of the times you can't really join the larger groups casual conversation because of the language barrier.

2. Smoking & drinking is mandatory to create bond and friendship. Drinking is expected by everyone in parties and if you don't you literally are left out like a wierdo. While Smoking is almost like your everyhour insuline dose. The quantity of cigerattes smoked by these young people even in their early 20s literally amuse me. What's the craze with all this smoking? And most of the coffe chats at office includes smoking due to which if you are a non-smoker you can't literally join them suffocating yourself. 

It's really difficult to build a friend circle or be a part of the office group if you don't smoke and if you are not a native hindi speaker. At the end I'm left wondering if it's a problem only with me or with almost everyone in the similar situation as mine. ",5,1738258822.0,india,0,1.0,False

**Alex Maverick and the Swamp Monster**

**CHAPTER SEVEN**

---

It’s morning. Wednesday, I think. I’ve lost track of the days of the week. I am so freaking tired. If I was in a Freddy Kruger movie, I’d be dead meat. Last night, I tried to fall asleep multiple times after spending an hour teaching Nate how to play Go Fish, but it was almost impossible with him and Dumah sitting up talking about angel stuff. Even Dutch finally gave up, grabbed a sheet off one of the beds, and disappeared into the bathroom, where he wound up sleeping in the tub. I ended up passing out by putting a pillow over my head and asking Paschar if he could fill my head with static like you hear on the TV when you’ve flipped to one of the channels you don’t get.

The four of us are sitting in a cramped booth at another road-side diner in this sinkhole of a town. The diner is called “Morning Bo’s”. I assume it was started by a man or a woman named Bo. Who knows why people name things what they do? It’s the kind of diner where you expect to find cockroach footprints in your ice cream sundae. We’re not having sundaes though, because it’s Wednesday. Also, it’s breakfast time, so I have to eat something to get me through the day, and ice cream does not cut it.

A middle-aged lady with black hair done up in a bun on top of her head and an overly cheerful smile on her face approaches us. She’s wearing one of those classic waitress uniforms, the kind of pink that looks like its stored in a heavy smoker’s wardrobe overnight, with a matching yellow-white apron with lots of pockets. She smacks her lips together in a loud fashion as she chews some bubblegum to hide the smell of her nicotine addiction.

“Good morning!” she says in a sing-songy voice that she probably puts on for customers, “My name is Hailey. What can I get for y’all?” She reminds me of the lady from Peewee’s Big Adventure, Simone, with the angry boyfriend. I had a friend once named Simone. I bet she’s waiting for the school bus right now, like a normal kid with a normal life. I wonder if my Simone has an angry boyfriend like Peewee’s Simone did.

“Waffles, please,” I mutter into the table top that my face is smushed, “And a glass of milk.”

The table is nice and cool on my face. Why is it so stupidly hot around here?

Dutch orders a coffee with cream and an omelet with grit. I don’t understand why anyone would want grit in their food, let alone pay a diner to do it for them. If you want your eggs to be crunchy so badly, just drop the omelet on the ground outside and you’re good. Paschar calmly explains to me why “grits” are not the same as “grit” that you find on the ground. I tell him that people need to stop naming food after dirt and trash because it just gets confusing.

Hailey’s smile twitches when she looks at Dumah. “A-and you?” she stutters, trying her best to keep the presentation of pleasantness up.

Dumah turns his hollow gaze upon her and gives a shrug. “What would I do with human food?”

Nate quickly interjects. “Don’t say human, just say food.” He smiles at poor Hailey in an attempt to get her to smile back but she’s too busy replaying Dumah’s words in her head and letting her forehead squiggle.

“Better yet,” I mumble into the linoleum, “just say, ‘nothing for me, thanks.’”

“Nothing for me, thank you,” Dumah continues to stare at our server with his fake eyes, then breaks out a rigored grin in a poor imitation of his brother.

Hailey hisses involuntarily and cringes away slightly. None of us is particularly bothered by this, but I can see Dutch staring nervously at his napkin. After regaining her composure, she turns to Nate. “And —heh-- last but not least! A-anything for you… bright eyes?” At the mention of eyes, she glances back to Dumah briefly.

“Do you, by chance, have the cereal called, ‘Raisin Bran’?” Nate asks.

“We got all sorts of cereals.”

Nate claps his hands excitedly. “I would love a bowl of your Raisin Bran, with the milk of a cow. Pasteurized. And a bowl of fresh, local fruit on the side. Please.”

“Not human milk?” Hailey asks with a scoff.

Nate becomes noticeably fascinated. “Is it pasteurized?”

She rolls her eyes, then turns and walks away without answering.

Almost immediately, she’s back, shoving a plate with a hot, buttery waffle against the side of my face. I must have fallen asleep with my face on this nice, cool tabletop. I would estimate fifteen minutes have gone by, based on the pool of drool by my mouth.

“Heads up, Alex,” says Nate.

Hailey chuckles as she continues to try to push the plate up my nose. “Someone’s a sleepyhead!”

Everyone else got their food already while I snoozed. Dutch keeps his head down as he cuts up his eggs and dirt or whatever grits is and stirs his coffee. Nate is already half done with his bowl of cereal and fruit. He appears to be pleased as punch about this. Dumah plucks a blueberry from Nate’s bowl and pops it past his chompers, where it disappears into the empty blackness within his skin suit. I imagine it rolling around inside him like a marble in a balloon. He stares into the middle distance for a moment like a malfunctioning robot.

“I don’t understand,” he finally says as he watches Nate take another spoonful of bran flakes and sugar-coated raisins bathed in the milk of a herd animal, “do you derive pleasure from consuming food?”

Nate laughs, choking on the spoon and spraying chewed cereal bits onto the table. A dribble of milk comes out his nose. He coughs and wipes his eyes with his napkin. “Brother, I’ve got a whole digestive system working in this framework.” He says, taking a moment to blow his nose. “I can taste things, as well as smell them. I can’t even describe to you what the sensations are like, you just have to experience them.” He pauses, looking at the wet napkin. “Except for that last one. That hurt. Don’t do that.”

“All is naught but ash,” Dumah retorts dismissively.

I butter my waffle with the little, cold butters the diner provided. It spreads like chalk on a wool sweater. My poor, lovely waffle. And worse, the only syrup they offer is some off-brand, brown, sugar water fake crap that turns into a grizzly crust around the outside of the syrup jar. And that’s what it’s going to be doing in my stomach after I eat it. Hopefully my tummy can hold it all in.

“Sirs,” Dutch says nervously, glancing around to make sure our waitress isn’t within earshot, “please, take no offense… but it might be better if you didn’t talk like you were Martians who just arrived on Earth.”

I take the opportunity to look around and observe the other patrons in the establishment. They all seem to be immersed in their own lives, but any of them could be eavesdropping and just really good at acting casual when they hear weird stuff. There’s a gaunt-looking lady who is probably a retired teacher or something. It feels so unnatural not immediately knowing things about every person around me. Like Hailey: what’s her deal? Is she married? Does she have kids? How long has she been a smoker? I don’t even know her last name.

Dumah ignores Dutch and turns his attention to me. “Oh, speaking of that—“ he sticks a hand into his business suit and pulls out a fork. It’s made from polished silver and has a little emblem scratched into it that looks like a turtle drawn by a caveman. “This is for you.” He holds the fork out to me.

“I already have a fork,” I say through a mouthful of waffle, wiggling the one I just used to put said waffle into my waffle hole.

“This isn’t for stabbing waffles, it’s a totem.”

“Uh,” I glance at Paschar, “I already have one of *those* too.”

“Who assigned you a totem?” asks Nate, reaching for the fork. Dumah jerks it back, then switches hands and tries to pass it to me again.

“No,” Paschar chimes in, “the important question is *who’s* totem is it?” He sounds like he’s reaching his wit’s end with Dumah. “I know the inventory, there is no fork totem. Dumah, you’re already playing with fire just by being here! If you really brought unsanctioned tutelary material to the other side, they are going to—“

“This isn’t connected to one of us,” Dumah doesn’t look at Nate or Paschar, he keeps his gaze strictly on me. “I made this one myself. It’s linked to the Trishul of Durga.”

The Trident of Durga. It’s a demon-killing weapon I held for a while the last time I was in the Veil. I don’t fully understand its power, but Dumah was definitely fascinated by the fact that the trident let me hold it at all. I guess it’s supposed to be pretty vicious when fighting demons, but I wouldn’t know. Only two things actually felt the wrath of the trident… one was this nasty, ugly brute called Mot. The other was Paschar.

Speaking of Paschar, he explodes. Not literally, but you know… angrily.

“You brought the Trishul of Durga back to the mortal plane?! Have you completely lost touch with reality?! Enough of this madness, you’re as far gone as Sam was!”

Dumah’s fake eyes bug out of their sockets at the mention of their dead brother. “How dare you?!” he hisses, which is really impressive because I don’t think he actually has a tongue in his mouth. “I am trying to *fix* what Samael did! These things that he released upon humanity are undetectable by *you* and untouchable by *her*.” He jabs the fork in my direction. “But they are not immune to *this*.” He waves the fork in a flourish as he says that last part.

Another look around at our fellow breakfasters reveals that some of them have noticed the heavy-set, bald man brandishing a dangerous-looking fork and seemingly yelling at Dutch, who hasn’t said a thing in a while. Poor Dutch is just keeping his head down and stirring his coffee for the life of him.

I snatch the fork out of Dumah’s hand before things escalate further. I give Paschar and Dumah both stinkeyes. “Can we finish our breakfasts and talk about this somewhere less public?”

“PLEASE,” Dutch whispers into his coffee.

Immediately, my hand is on fire. Not real fire, but it feels like I’ve stuck it in a microwave and it’s being cooked from the inside out. I want to scream and throw the fork away, but I can’t. Instead, my hand clenches it tighter, and the scream sticks in my throat where it becomes a warbling sound instead like one of those water whistles in the shape of a bird. I don’t know what else to do so I turn to Dutch as my vision blurs through tears. 

Dutch instinctively reaches for me to try to pry the fork out of my hand.

“DO NOT TOUCH HER!” Dumah snaps, attracting the attention of even more people in the diner.

Hushed comments and whispers pass among the other patrons. Miss Hailey watches from another table, her expression a mixture of confusion and annoyance. She frowns and chews her bubblegum. Despite not being able to read minds, I’m pretty sure I can tell what she’s thinking, and it’s something along the lines of wishing our weird, little troupe had never walked in here this morning.

Nate ignores Dumah’s command and reaches across the table, trying to pry my fingers open. He can’t.

“Alex, drop the fork!”

I would if I could! The searing hot sensation has filled my hand and is starting to travel over my palm toward my arm, but for some reason it stops at my wrist, not going any further. Instead, a red circular mark with a squiggly line and a star in the middle of it appears on my skin. It’s raised, angry and sore-looking, like someone pressed a cow brand on me. It also seems to turn back the feeling of pain, spreading a cool, comforting sensation back down over my burning hand. As the last ember of pain fades, I finally manage to stop whistling with my throat. My whole arm gets super heavy feeling and I just let it drop to the table top with a THUD, where it jostles all the other dishes and utensils.

Nate cautiously sits back in his chair. “What just happened?”

Dumah strokes his chin and looks at my hand. “I would wager that the sheer power of Durga’s Legacy does not translate well to a smaller container. Think of it like taking all of the water in the ocean and pouring it into a flagon. The mistake was mine. I should have added some sort of power dampener or a capacitor of some variety.”

“You think?!” Paschar snarls. “You had no business trying to MacGyver a totem to one of the most dangerous relics of Samael’s design, let alone hand it off to Lily —I mean Alex— without any prior analysis or comprehensive testing done!”

Dutch raises his hand up over his head. “Check please!”

“Alex.” For the first time I think that I’ve ever known, Dumah looks at me with… what is that? Is that regret? Shame? I can’t tell. The expression is clearly foreign to him. “I am very, *very* sorry for not thinking before giving you that totem. Though deep down I feel an overwhelming sense of providence that you happen to have that mark—“ he gestures toward the red welt on my wrist as he says this, “— the Mark of the Witch Queen Hekate on you. I had no idea she’d placed her sigil on you. A good thing, to be sure. I think we’d all be witnessing a human inferno right now otherwise.”

“The what?” Nate squints at my arm. “I don’t see anything. What are you talking about?”

“I want to ask how you can see Hekate’s mark,” Paschar begins, “considering even I’ve never been able to see it. But I think the important thing is YOU ALMOST KILLED HER.”

Dumah doesn’t blink. “I said I was sorry.”

I shake my hand with the fork in it, but it won’t let go. “I can’t drop it.”

“It does not want you to, I suppose.”

“You *suppose*?!” I think Paschar is about to become a doll inferno. He sounds about ready to tear through the Veil and strangle Dumah with his bare hands. That probably wouldn’t do much though.

The waitress Hailey marches up to our table with a stern-looking man in a greasy apron standing directly behind her. He’s got a grizzly, salt-and-pepper beard and is holding a large frying pan that’s clearly been used recently. Neither of them looks particularly happy.

“Here’s your tab. We’ll thank ya to pay up and leave… NOW.” Hailey says in a far less cheerful voice. “Y’all just get the Hell out of here and never come back, hear me? Just move on to wherever y’all were going. We don’t need none of this— whatever this is— around these parts.”

The man in the apron grunts and nods. “If I see you in here again, I’m putting your asses on the menu,” he threatens in a low voice.

Nate looks mystified at the idea of his ass being on the menu. Dumah, as usual, is unfazed at everything.

Dutch stares at the table and pulls out his leather wallet he always keeps in his coat pocket. He throws several high value bills on the table. “I’m really sorry for the disturbance—“ he starts to say without looking Hailey or her bouncer in the eyes.

“GET. OUT.” Hailey points toward the doors leading to the sidewalk.

“Look what you did,” Paschar starts into a lecture. “Now it’s going to be even harder for you to keep a low profile around town.”

Dumah snorts. “Me?”

“YES. YOU.” Hailey glares daggers at him. I can hear the guy behind her squeezing the handle of his frying pan in anticipation of getting to swing it.

I grab Paschar off the table just as Dutch starts urgently pushing me out of the booth. “Please stop talking to the doll,” I say through the side of my mouth to Dumah.

Most everyone else in the diner watches our little group leave with the same expression, a mix of disgust and confusion rubbed over a lemon. The only one that stands out is a little boy, maybe six or seven years old, standing on his chair as his mom clutches at his arm and tries to make him sit back down. He looks directly at me with eyes filled with fascination and wonder. What does he see that makes him so curious? Three grown men and a crinkly-haired teenage girl clutching a fork like its the only thing left in the world? Two angels in human outfits and a talking doll? Something else? I’ll never know.

“What do we do now?” I ask as we stand out on the sidewalk in the morning heat like a bunch of time-traveling starship personnel trying to locate a pair of humpback whales in San Francisco. 

Across the street sits Officer Lafleur in an black, unmarked vehicle, trying to blend in to the other cars parked along that side of the street. He’s got a pair of dark sunglasses on and is wearing a red baseball cap with the word “CAJUNS” on it in letters so bold I can read them from across the street and through the tinted windshield. I imagine if hide-and-go-seek was a team sport, Officer Lafleur would always get picked last.

Nate speaks up. “Take us to where you think you saw the… whatever it is.”

“What do we do about our tail?” I ask, pointing directly at Lafleur so he sees that I see him. He has a violent reaction to this in his car, his head snapping to the side and then his whole body trying to stuff itself down into his seat.

Nate squints in his direction. “Is that a friend of yours?”

“That’s the cop that pulled us over two nights ago.”

Dutch, to his credit, is trying really hard to stand patiently still and stay out of everything going on, but he physically tenses up when he realizes Lafleur is nearby and watching us. He clenches and unclenches his fists while grinding his teeth and scrunching up his face.

Nate’s mouth curves up on one side in a smirk. “I’ll take care of it.”

“Please don’t set him on fire,” pleads Paschar.

“I’m just going to melt his tires.” He raises one hand, ever so subtly at his side, pointing four fingers in the direction of Lafleur who has completely disappeared from view inside his black sedan. Nothing seems to happen, but it doesn’t take long for us to be able to visibly see the two tires on the side nearest us starting to sag. I feel a little bad for the guy, because tires are expensive, but he is being a total dink. However, the tires don’t simply melt into goop like I thought they would. Instead, we’re all startled by four loud BANGs in quick repetition as the car’s tires burst like balloons.

Lafleur screams and thrashes around inside his car some more. I can see him waving a pistol around suddenly. He seems to discharge it in a panic, blowing a hole through the roof. People walking by also scream and drop to the ground. One guy dashes into the door of a nearby shop, completely abandoning the woman he was walking with. I imagine they’re going to have a fun conversation about it later.

“Run!” Paschar says urgently.

1idskjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShyBladderIPA/comments/1idskjw/yooooo_24m/,Yooooo 24/m,"I had bad heart palpitations for 3 months from September - December and basically ended 2024 for me. I've been better since 2025 started but I've been looking for treatments to cure my last health problems. 

I've been trying to live a normal life but this has been a major setback. Since September I have not felt the same in my own body. I feel weak, numb and in constant discomfort. I've been sober from alcohol for months and taken minimal caffeine but eliminated tea, coffee and energy drinks. 

During the heart palpitations I also experienced bladder issues, my bladder would come out weak and I would have trouble starting and would stop and start during my stream. This has also gotten better since January but whenever I'm out it still shrivels in public and seems very shy and it doesn't always empty when I'm outside. 

Even though the days have gone where I would experience sudden drops in my blood pressure, rapid heart rate, weak (I mean super weak) shaky, tired from my heart palpitations a month ago. I am still experiencing heart palpitations, I can feel them when I sit down and I can feel them when I try rest my head. 

Is there some underlying anxiety and stress going on in my body? On the surface I don't tense up in social situations and people see me on the outside as a very confident autistic adult who can conduct myself but on the inside I'm fighting a constant battle with demons. 

So far I've done a blood test through my GP and they found nothing, I tried to get my GP to do another examination and they just used my words against me and dismissed my questions. Fuck my GP they got 2 star rating and they never seem to care. 

I forked out money for a private urologist. He was a good individual. Fortunately my lifestyle changes finally kicked in and my bladder started working again, I just don't know why it is so shy when I'm out...my urologist gave me a quote to go hospital but it would of costed me 2k and there was uncertainty whether they'd find anything wrong. 

I'm going to hypnotherapy tomorrow and next week I have a consultation about erectile dysfunction because I can't get morning wood. I'm also thinking of getting a doctor who specialises in heart palpitations but I fear that if my heart rate is good which I tested it out on an app and it came back normal, I fear there will be no treatment for me because I can't prove anything and it seems like a waste of money. 

Before I end I have a few questions on mind. 

If I still have my heart palpitations is it making my bladder shy and my body weak? 

What treatment should I require? 

Could I suffer from underlying anxiety and stress? 

I'm sure I have more questions on my mind but those are all I can think of now...

Flow state, mindfulness, and consciousness control are tools for becoming one with our universe

**The path to enlightenment resides in every aspect of our life**. Contrary to what is most believed by the masses, one can walk the path to enlightenment by any activity of her choosing. And in most cases, **reaching a state of total awareness, or mindfulness is never a mystery that is far from the reach of those who do not 'devote' themselves into a school of religious or spiritual practice.**

I am a musician. I can say that **most of the musicians who reach a professional level of mastery at their selected instrument have reached a high level of mindfulness by simply honing their craft without trying to get into mindfulness**.

I started playing guitar at 17 in high school and decided that I wanted to become a professional player at 21 when I was in college studying chemical engineering. Starting at such an old age, I decided that I must practice guitar 6 hours a day to play catch-up, which basically took every second of my waking hours outside of studying, eating, showering, and laundry. The 6-hour daily routine was painful at first. The first couple of hours were fine; I was able to focus and perform the exercises, but then my mind devolved into this state of wandering where random thoughts that don't really matter just pop out of nowhere, such as 'What do others think of me suddenly wanting to pursue music as a career? Will they laugh at me?', 'What if I fail? Will I become a laughingstock for others?', or more trivial matters such as 'What should I eat for lunch today?' or 'Did I say something inappropriate the other day during class?' Needless to say, the remaining hours of the practice became an ordeal for me. As painful as it was, I managed to maintain the 6-hour practice routine for a few more weeks out of passion for music. After those very tormenting weeks, something amazing happened to me.

At first, I found it much easier for me to get into this state of focus, **what I noticed first is that I can learn the stuff much faster now**. What normally took me a few days to learn, give it a scale, a chord, or a lick, I could get them done in a day or two's worth of practices. Certainly, this might be contributed to my level of dexterity getting better, but it almost felt real for me that, **I became smarter by being more focused.** No only that I became more focused, I was also able to sustain it longer. What was 30 minutes of intense focus got extended into 1 hours, 3 hours, and eventually the entire practice session. It was not for another months before I managed to sustain it through the entire session of course, but **once this thing started rolling, it became easier and easier for me.** Not only I was able to sustain the 6-hour practice daily routine, that routine was furthered into 10 hour practice daily routine after I graduated from college and devoted full time into the music career.

The amazing experience did not stop at getting better at guitar playing itself, I found myself to be able to concentrate my mind into a single point, in this case, the sound. **And when I was in that mode, things slows down in front of me, I can sense the tiniest details of the sound**, not just the sound from my own guitar playing, but the surrounding sound in the environment as well. **I also felt a warm flow of energy connecting my brain, my fingers, and my ears, cycling non-stop**. It was very soothing experience, to me, 6 hours of practice was no longer a chore, it became a getaway for me, if not paradise.

Not until a couple years later after reading quite some philosophy books including eastern schools such as Taoism itself and Zen Buddhism, and western schools such as Arthur Schopenhauer did I understand what was happening to me. Simply put, it was **the first stage of achievement towards enlightenment called flow state, or 'in the zone'.**

# 

# What is flow state?

**When a mind is concentrated at a high level, it forgets its own existence and becomes one with the object**.  This is often referred to as flow state, or 'in the zone', a term used to describe a state of deep focus and effortless performance where everything seems to click. It's like **you're so immersed in what you're doing that you lose track of time, self-consciousness fades away, and every action flows naturally without much effort**. In this state, every action feels effortless, and everything seems to align perfectly. It’s a magical blend of intense focus, intrinsic motivation, and a sense of control over the task at hand.

# Characteristics of the Flow State

1. **Complete Concentration** In flow, your mind is wholly focused on the activity. Everything outside the task fades into the background, your thoughts, worries, and even the passage of time. For example, an artist painting might not realize they’ve been working for hours because they’re so absorbed in their work.
2. **Merging of Action and Awareness** You feel like there’s no separation between you and what you’re doing. A musician might become one with their instrument, or a runner might feel their body and the path beneath them moving in perfect harmony.
3. **Loss of Self-Consciousness** In flow, there’s no room for self-doubt or overthinking. You’re not worried about how you look or what others might think. You’re simply being in the moment.
4. **Distorted Sense of Time** Time either slows down at a moment or speeds up over a duration. Things around you might feel like they are in slow motion, and you might spend hours on a task but feel like only minutes have passed.
5. **Effortlessness and Ease** While the task itself might be demanding, it feels effortless in flow. Every movement and decision seems to arise naturally, without forcing anything.
6. **Intrinsic Reward** The activity itself becomes its own reward. You’re not driven by external validation or outcomes; instead, the joy of doing the task fuels your motivation.

# 

Simply put, **flow state happens when you're deeply focused on a challenging task, usually one that requires skill**. It's rewarding on its own because not only it helps you master that activity but also shields you from negative feelings like self-doubt, anxiety, and overthinking. It’s a way to both improve and find peace at the same time.

Interestingly, the concept of flow aligns closely with Taoist philosophy, particularly the practice of Wu Wei (无为), or ""effortless action."" Both emphasize aligning with the natural flow of life and achieving harmony by letting go of resistance and overthinking. Just as Taoism encourages living in harmony with the Tao, flow involves syncing your mind and body with the task, allowing everything to unfold naturally. So in Taoism, flow state is part of the Wu Wei practice where enlightenment is set as the ultimate goal.

Flow state is an incredible experience, but it has its limits, that it can only be triggered while performing a skill-intensive task. But what if someone could enter this state of deep focus and presence at will, like flipping a switch, without needing to engage in those activities? This is where the journey transitions to **the second stage of achievement towards enlightenment: mindfulness.**

# What is mindfulness?

Mindfulness is **the ability to enter a flow state-like mode without needing to engage in a skill-demanding task**. Unlike flow state, which requires intense focus on an activity to reach that state of deep immersion, mindfulness allows you to tap into a similar sense of presence and peace at any time, no matter what you’re doing.

In mindfulness, you don’t rely on external tasks to quiet your mind or fully engage your awareness. Instead, **much like the intense focus of the flow state, you simply observe the present moment with full attention**; whether it’s the rhythm of your breath, the sensations in your body, or the sounds around you. It’s as if you’re tapping into the clarity and calm of the flow state, but without needing a specific trigger, your mind itself becomes the focus.

This makes mindfulness incredibly versatile and powerful. **It can be practiced during everyday activities, like walking, eating, or even waiting in line**. Over time, it becomes a tool to find balance and focus even in the most chaotic or mundane situations, offering a sustainable way to stay centered without the need for external conditions to be perfect.

It was only after years of intensive guitar practice and heavy reading that I one day realized I could do this. The euphoria I felt was incredible, it feels like unlocking a hidden superpower. **From that moment on, I have never experienced a single night of difficulty falling asleep, no matter how bad the situation is, be it career struggles, financial issues, or personal hardships**.

Whenever I lie down, I naturally enter this state of mindfulness, and all my thoughts simply drift away. It feels like I become a feather floating in mid-air, gently swaying with the motion of a soft breeze, moving left and right in a soothing, lullaby-like rhythm. This calming sensation has allowed me to fall asleep within five minutes every single time. Unless I have had one too many cups of coffee, of course.

**Another incredible benefit of being able to enter mindfulness is that I never feel bored anymore**, even when working on mundane tasks like data entry during the early days of starting my first business. By simply shifting my focus to the present moment, the sound of the keyboard clicking, the rhythm of my fingers typing, or even the small details on the screen, I find myself fully engaged, almost as if the boring task itself transforms into something fun. Mindfulness turns even the most tedious chores into opportunities for calm and presence, making boredom a thing of the past.

The third benefit of this 'superpower' is the ability to channel negative thoughts into positive ones. **When negativity creeps in, whether it's anger, self-doubt, anxiety, frustration or depression, mindfulness provides a way to pause and redirect those thoughts**. Instead of fighting them, I observe them without judgment by entering mindfulness, almost like watching clouds pass in the sky. This simple act creates space between me and the negativity, allowing me to 'quarantine' it. By doing so, **a setback becomes a lesson, a failure turns into growth, and uncertainty becomes a chance for curiosity**.

But of course, the ability to channel these negative thoughts is its own craft, requiring years of practice and patience to master. **Much like using an instrument to create beautiful music, mindfulness is merely a tool to orchestrate this great symphony of peace of mind**. It takes time to learn how to harmonize conflicting thoughts and emotions, to turn noise into melody. Mindfulness provides the foundation, but it’s through intentional practice and reflection that one can truly conduct this inner symphony, transforming life's chaos into a steady rhythm of balance and clarity.

The final benefit of this state of mindfulness is that your senses become much sharper. Colors appear more vivid, sounds feel richer, and even the texture of simple things, like the fabric of your clothes or the coolness of a breeze, becomes more noticeable. Simply put, it’s a higher level of awareness. **When you reach this state, you realize how limited your senses used to be, almost like an animal confined to a very narrow range of perception**. The world now feels bigger, richer, and more vibrant, and you can fully immerse yourself in the present moment like never before. You start to experience the world with a heightened awareness, as if a fog has been lifted. This heightened perception allows you to fully engage with the present moment, appreciating life’s subtle details that often go unnoticed. It’s like switching from a blurry, dim lens to crystal-clear, high-definition vision, making even the simplest experiences feel meaningful.

**Meditation is the most common practice to learn mindfulness** because it provides a structured way to train your mind to focus on the present moment. By setting aside time for meditation, you create a dedicated space to observe your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations without judgment. This practice develops the mental clarity and awareness that are at the heart of mindfulness. Meditation isn’t the only way to practice mindfulness, but it’s one of the most effective. Over time, the skills developed in meditation naturally expand into other areas of your life, allowing you to experience mindfulness in everything you do.

My path to mindfulness was accidental. I did not know what mindfulness meant until I had reached it by comparing the things I could do to what it enables. So, it might offer some insightful knowledge to those still on the journey to achieving it. One way to begin is by reaching the flow state through practicing a challenging skill first, to get a taste of how mindfulness feels, and then working from there to apply the same level of focus to every aspect of daily life, no matter how trivial. Another thing I did right was that I read a lot history and philosophy classics, with the [*Tao Te Ching*](https://www.taooflife.org/post/tao-te-ching-translation) being one of them. This, I believe, helped me significantly, although I understand that it’s not for everyone. In short, there is no fixed route to mindfulness. **Everyone walks a different path, so don’t try to find the “best way” or a “shortcut.” Instead, work with whatever resonates with you**.

Now the final stage before achieving enlightenment, it is something I vaguely sense but am not 100% sure of its existence, and I might not be able to get there even if it is real. Currently mostly based on my speculation, It is **the full ability to control consciousness at will.**

# Our conscious and subconscious mind

Our mind is made of consciousness and subconsciousness. According to most psychological models, the conscious mind represents only a small portion of our overall awareness, while the subconscious mind encompasses a much larger domain. The subconscious holds memories, beliefs, and patterns that are not actively in focus yet significantly influence our behavior. In essence, the conscious mind is like the visible tip of an iceberg, while the subconscious forms the vast majority hidden below the surface.

Once we reach a level where we can enter mindfulness at will, it becomes possible to explore the next step: attempting to control our consciousness. **While the subconscious mind may seem uncontrollable, it can still be influenced through conscious effort**. The subconscious can be understood as an accumulation of thoughts, ideas, beliefs, experiences, and memories formed over the years. By adjusting our perspective, which is an inherent function of consciousness, we can begin to ""make sense"" of this vast reservoir and indirectly shape its influence on our behavior and perceptions.

# So what does it mean to control the consciousness?

The first level of control over consciousness is the ability to pause and unpause it at will. In Taoism, *Zuowang (坐忘)*, or 'sitting and forgetting', is an essential spiritual practice that embodies this concept. **Zuowang represents a level beyond the practice of mindfulness**, where the practitioner seeks to stop the consciousness entirely instead of entering a flow state, a state of channeling all consciousness into a singular point of focus.

So, what is it like to stop your consciousness? I've only been able to achieve this for less than a couple of years. From my experience, you can make your mind 'blank' at will. **When the mind goes blank, you shift into the role of a pure observer, fully present to both the internal and external worlds**. Although not exactly the same, this state aligns with the 19th-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer's theory of the 'will-less' state, where one transcends desires and personal drives, entering a realm of pure perception and detached awareness.

There are obvious benefits to the ability to stop consciousness.

**The first benefit is that you gain almost full control over your temper, mood, and thoughts.** When negativity creeps in, you don’t need to channel these feelings elsewhere by redirecting your focus to a task or a thought, whether that’s achieving a flow state or practicing mindfulness. **You simply put a stop to consciousness itself, allowing those negative feelings to dissipate.** Individuals who attain this level of mastery over their consciousness will notice their temper becomes moderated and they develop immunity to provocation. **They will act spontaneously in any situation, no longer hindered by feelings of nervousness, intimidation, or awkwardness, which often stem from self-consciousness.**

Moreover, **these individuals do not feel the need to rise above others, to triumph over them, or to express themselves for validation**. Such desires typically arise from a consciousness driven by bodily urges, leading to a state of perpetual uneasiness, anxiety, and frustration. By relinquishing these needs, they create a sense of inner calm that allows for deeper self-awareness and a more harmonious existence.

This ability fosters an environment in which external pressures and societal expectations lose their grip. **Those who can stop consciousness often find themselves free from the burden of competing with others, enabling them to pursue their passions and interests for their own sake rather than for external approval**. This shift in perspective cultivates a kind of contentment that is neither dependent on success nor disturbed by failure.

As a result, they become more resilient in the face of life’s challenges. Without the constant fluctuations brought on by mood and desire, they can navigate adversities with a peace of mind. This newfound resilience allows them to engage with their surroundings fully, appreciating experiences as they come rather than filtering them through a lens of comparison or striving.

**Another good thing about being able to pause the consciousness is to fill the mind with pure happiness.** By stopping the consciousness, the body and mind become one, and thus in perfect harmony with one another, **once this state is established, there are waves of joy spurt out from within the chest**. This state is much like an infant, whose consciousness is still undeveloped due to the absence of accumulated building blocks such as memory and experience. Like an infant, one returns to a state of pure being, untainted by mental clutter, judgments, or external pressures, experiencing life in its most natural and unfiltered form.

It is the pure form of happiness that requires no reason, no longer one needs the stimulation of earthly achievements such as money, power, and fame to be content. Especially when the latter often bring more suffering than happiness. Speaking of which, let's reach a little further on the topic since we are already here. Does this mean we should not seek earthly success? The answer is that it doesn't matter, but we do need money for our overall well-being, so it is not a bad idea to seek money. As for the other two, it depends on the lifestyle you choose, if your path is politics, yes, then seek power; if you are an actor, your main practice is through acting, then yes, seek fame. What we seek is not important, the important thing is that we walk the path not sacrificing the true happiness. [The way to pursue money, power, and fame without compromising this core value is what Wu Wei practice all about, you can read more about it in this other article.](https://www.taooflife.org/post/what-is-wu-wei-and-why-it-is-good-for-us)

# The next level of controlling the consciousness is reconstruct the consciousness at will.

**Since I have yet to achieve this level, much of what I share below is based on speculation**. Following the ability to pause consciousness, the next natural step would likely involve the capacity to reconstruct it at will.

# What does it mean to reconstruct consciousness?

**First of all, consciousness relies on the continuous stream of information provided by the senses to exist**. The normal process of its formation is as follows: sensory inputs from the external world are collected, processed, and integrated into a coherent experience. These inputs are then interpreted by the mind, giving rise to thoughts, emotions, and an awareness of the present moment, collectively known as consciousness.

Reconstructing consciousness, on the other hand, represents the opposite process. **It is an advanced ability to control the mind so powerfully that it can actively influence and ""backfeed"" the senses, shaping the sensory experience according to the consciousness it chooses to reconstruct**. In this state, the practitioner reverses the flow of influence, using the mind to redefine perception, creating a subjective reality shaped by intentional thought rather than raw sensory data.

Does this sound too sci-fi? It’s not. In fact, **there’s a very common and age-old method of reconstructing consciousness called art**. Art, in all its forms, is a deliberate act of shaping perception, allowing the artist to implant their consciousness into the mind of their audience, effectively reconstructing it. This is why, when we immerse ourselves in a masterpiece, be it a symphony, a novel, a painting, or even a film, we momentarily forget our own existence. We are transported to a different time and space, experiencing the world as the creator once did.

Any skilled artist possesses the ability to transform their consciousness into sensory media, whether through sound, visuals, or words. However, it is the 'quality' of the consciousness they project that determines whether their work becomes popular, resonates deeply with others, or attains the status of a classic. Therefore, an artist passively waits for 'inspiration' to strike before transforming their consciousness into a medium of the senses, and their audience relies on this medium to passively reconstruct a very specific sample of consciousness. This is how we know that **artistic ability is not the same concept as the reconstruction of consciousness we are discussing here, but merely a specific example of it**. It also explains why being a great artist alone is not enough to reconstruct consciousness at will.

# What is it like to be able to reconstruct consciousness?

**The ability to reconstruct consciousness is so profound that the possessor of this gift can perceive the world through the eyes of others, both literally and metaphorically**. They gain the capacity to see what others see, feel what others feel, and experience reality from perspectives entirely different from their own. Remarkably, this ""others"" is not confined to human beings. Instead, **it transcends the human experience, extending its reach to all entities in existence**. From the smallest atom vibrating with its inherent energy to the vast, incomprehensible expanse of the universe, everything carries its own form of ""consciousness,"" a unique fingerprint shaped by its state, function, and existence within the cosmos.

**When one attains such an ability, their understanding of reality shifts from the limited confines of individuality to the limitless interconnectedness of all things**. They are no longer bound by their personal senses or self-centered awareness. Instead, they can tap into the universal flow of information, aligning themselves with the ""consciousness"" of any being, object, or system they desire. Just like Zhuangzi's dream of becoming a butterfly, **the boundaries between self and other begin to blur**. In his dream, Zhuangzi did not know whether he was Zhuangzi dreaming of being a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming of being Zhuangzi. This profound parable speaks to a truth about the nature of consciousness, its fluid, shifting, and interconnected form.

This ability dissolves barriers, leaving the practitioner with an intimate understanding of the fabric of existence, as if they were simultaneously the observer and the observed, the creator and the creation.[ In](http://creation.in/) this state, the boundaries between ""self"" and ""other"" evaporate. A rock, seemingly inanimate, reveals its ancient story through its molecular vibrations. A tree shares its silent dialogue with the wind and the whispers of the earth beneath its roots. A distant star, light-years away, projects its own consciousness through its pulsating energy, carrying tales of its birth, life, and eventual death. **Even the universe itself, vast and eternal, breathes with a consciousness so immense it defies comprehension, yet one who reconstructs consciousness can feel its pulse, like a faint echo reverberating through eternity**.

The implications of such an ability are staggering. **Imagine understanding the struggles of another person intimately, not just through empathy or observation, but by actually becoming them in a sense, albeit temporarily**. Grasping their fears, their joy, their pain, not as an outsider but as if they were your own. It shifts the notion of communication from mere words to a profound unity of understanding, a complete dissolution of misunderstanding. Beyond the human plane, it allows one to sync with the rhythm of nature, to understand and harmonize with ecosystems, and perhaps even tap into the wisdom of the universe, Tao, itself.

Ultimately, to reconstruct consciousness is to engage in a sacred dance with existence. It is a journey that deepens one's relationship with the universe, revealing the truth that everything is connected, everything is alive in its own way, and everything has a story to tell, and through this ability, one can listen, understand, and even join that story, becoming a co-creator in the infinite tapestry of being.

# Beyond the ultimate control of consciousness

The flow state, mindfulness, and consciousness control are like Matryoshka dolls, where each subsequent layer contains the previous one. This means that the path to enlightenment is not linear. You reach the next level without leaving the previous one, which can be analogized to a pyramid structure, in which the previous level serves as the stepping stone, or foundation, for the next level.

**They serve as a toolkit for us to forge our path to enlightenment, the ultimate state of becoming one with Tao's manifestation in our universe — nature**. Once we have gathered all three tools, flow state, mindfulness, and consciousness control, we can apply them in our daily lives to uncover the profound meaning of the Tao.

To do this, **we begin by gathering building blocks: insights gleaned from reading, emotions stirred by appreciating art, music, and literature, reasoning developed through thinking, and feelings evoked by memories accessed during flow states**. Each of these components offers valuable perspectives and deepens our understanding of existence.

Using mindfulness, **we then organize these building blocks, cultivating an awareness that allows us to see how these elements interconnect**. Mindfulness encourages us to be present with our experiences, providing clarity and enhancing our ability to reflect on what we've gathered.

Finally, **we employ consciousness control to reconstruct our understanding of the universe's consciousness**. This transformative process enables us to weave together the insights and emotions we’ve collected, allowing us to perceive the richness of life through the lens of the Tao. By aligning ourselves with this universal consciousness, we not only gain deeper insights into our own existence but also foster a sense of unity with all that is.

In this way, our toolkit becomes a mean of exploration and connection, guiding us toward a more profound comprehension of Tao, the nature and our place within its vast manifestation. Only then can we say that we are enlightened.

In this article, we are going to explore the each stage before achieving the ultimate state of enlightenment.

Flow state, mindfulness, and consciousness control are tools for becoming one with our universe

**The path to enlightenment resides in every aspect of our life**. Contrary to what is most believed by the masses, one can walk the path to enlightenment by any activity of her choosing. And in most cases, **reaching a state of total awareness, or mindfulness is never a mystery that is far from the reach of those who do not 'devote' themselves into a school of religious or spiritual practice.**

I am a musician. I can say that **most of the musicians who reach a professional level of mastery at their selected instrument have reached a high level of mindfulness by simply honing their craft without trying to get into mindfulness**.

I started playing guitar at 17 in high school and decided that I wanted to become a professional player at 21 when I was in college studying chemical engineering. Starting at such an old age, I decided that I must practice guitar 6 hours a day to play catch-up, which basically took every second of my waking hours outside of studying, eating, showering, and laundry. The 6-hour daily routine was painful at first. The first couple of hours were fine; I was able to focus and perform the exercises, but then my mind devolved into this state of wandering where random thoughts that don't really matter just pop out of nowhere, such as 'What do others think of me suddenly wanting to pursue music as a career? Will they laugh at me?', 'What if I fail? Will I become a laughingstock for others?', or more trivial matters such as 'What should I eat for lunch today?' or 'Did I say something inappropriate the other day during class?' Needless to say, the remaining hours of the practice became an ordeal for me. As painful as it was, I managed to maintain the 6-hour practice routine for a few more weeks out of passion for music. After those very tormenting weeks, something amazing happened to me.

At first, I found it much easier for me to get into this state of focus, **what I noticed first is that I can learn the stuff much faster now**. What normally took me a few days to learn, give it a scale, a chord, or a lick, I could get them done in a day or two's worth of practices. Certainly, this might be contributed to my level of dexterity getting better, but it almost felt real for me that, **I became smarter by being more focused.**  No only that I became more focused, I was also able to sustain it longer. What was 30 minutes of intense focus got extended into 1 hours, 3 hours, and eventually the entire practice session. It was not for another months before I managed to sustain it through the entire session of course, but **once this thing started rolling, it became easier and easier for me.** Not only I was able to sustain the 6-hour practice daily routine, that routine was furthered into 10 hour practice daily routine after I graduated from college and devoted full time into the music career.

The amazing experience did not stop at getting better at guitar playing itself, I found myself to be able to concentrate my mind into a single point, in this case, the sound. **And when I was in that mode, things slows down in front of me, I can sense the tiniest details of the sound**, not just the sound from my own guitar playing, but the surrounding sound in the environment as well. **I also felt a warm flow of energy connecting my brain, my fingers, and my ears, cycling non-stop**. It was very soothing experience, to me, 6 hours of practice was no longer a chore, it became a getaway for me, if not paradise.

Not until a couple years later after reading quite some philosophy books including eastern schools such as Taoism itself and Zen Buddhism, and western schools such as Arthur Schopenhauer did I understand what was happening to me. Simply put, it was **the first stage of achievement towards enlightenment called flow state, or 'in the zone'.**

# 

# What is flow state?

**When a mind is concentrated at a high level, it forgets its own existence and becomes one with the object**.  This is often referred to as flow state, or 'in the zone',  a term used to describe a state of deep focus and effortless performance where everything seems to click. It's like **you're so immersed in what you're doing that you lose track of time, self-consciousness fades away, and every action flows naturally without much effort**. In this state, every action feels effortless, and everything seems to align perfectly. It’s a magical blend of intense focus, intrinsic motivation, and a sense of control over the task at hand.

# Characteristics of the Flow State

1. **Complete Concentration** In flow, your mind is wholly focused on the activity. Everything outside the task fades into the background, your thoughts, worries, and even the passage of time. For example, an artist painting might not realize they’ve been working for hours because they’re so absorbed in their work.
2. **Merging of Action and Awareness** You feel like there’s no separation between you and what you’re doing. A musician might become one with their instrument, or a runner might feel their body and the path beneath them moving in perfect harmony.
3. **Loss of Self-Consciousness** In flow, there’s no room for self-doubt or overthinking. You’re not worried about how you look or what others might think. You’re simply being in the moment.
4. **Distorted Sense of Time** Time either slows down at a moment or speeds up over a duration. Things around you might feel like they are in slow motion, and you might spend hours on a task but feel like only minutes have passed.
5. **Effortlessness and Ease** While the task itself might be demanding, it feels effortless in flow. Every movement and decision seems to arise naturally, without forcing anything.
6. **Intrinsic Reward** The activity itself becomes its own reward. You’re not driven by external validation or outcomes; instead, the joy of doing the task fuels your motivation.

# 

Simply put, **flow state happens when you're deeply focused on a challenging task, usually one that requires skill**. It's rewarding on its own because not only it helps you master that activity but also shields you from negative feelings like self-doubt, anxiety, and overthinking. It’s a way to both improve and find peace at the same time.

Interestingly, the concept of flow aligns closely with Taoist philosophy, particularly the practice of Wu Wei (无为), or ""effortless action."" Both emphasize aligning with the natural flow of life and achieving harmony by letting go of resistance and overthinking. Just as Taoism encourages living in harmony with the Tao, flow involves syncing your mind and body with the task, allowing everything to unfold naturally. So in Taoism, flow state is part of the Wu Wei practice where enlightenment is set as the ultimate goal.

Flow state is an incredible experience, but it has its limits, that it can only be triggered while performing a skill-intensive task. But what if someone could enter this state of deep focus and presence at will, like flipping a switch, without needing to engage in those activities? This is where the journey transitions to **the second stage of achievement towards enlightenment: mindfulness.**

# What is mindfulness?

Mindfulness is **the ability to enter a flow state-like mode without needing to engage in a skill-demanding task**. Unlike flow state, which requires intense focus on an activity to reach that state of deep immersion, mindfulness allows you to tap into a similar sense of presence and peace at any time, no matter what you’re doing.

In mindfulness, you don’t rely on external tasks to quiet your mind or fully engage your awareness. Instead, **much like the intense focus of the flow state, you simply observe the present moment with full attention**; whether it’s the rhythm of your breath, the sensations in your body, or the sounds around you. It’s as if you’re tapping into the clarity and calm of the flow state, but without needing a specific trigger, your mind itself becomes the focus.

This makes mindfulness incredibly versatile and powerful. **It can be practiced during everyday activities, like walking, eating, or even waiting in line**. Over time, it becomes a tool to find balance and focus even in the most chaotic or mundane situations, offering a sustainable way to stay centered without the need for external conditions to be perfect.

It was only after years of intensive guitar practice and heavy reading that I one day realized I could do this. The euphoria I felt was incredible, it feels like unlocking a hidden superpower. **From that moment on, I have never experienced a single night of difficulty falling asleep, no matter how bad the situation is, be it career struggles, financial issues, or personal hardships**.

Whenever I lie down, I naturally enter this state of mindfulness, and all my thoughts simply drift away. It feels like I become a feather floating in mid-air, gently swaying with the motion of a soft breeze, moving left and right in a soothing, lullaby-like rhythm. This calming sensation has allowed me to fall asleep within five minutes every single time. Unless I have had one too many cups of coffee, of course.

**Another incredible benefit of being able to enter mindfulness is that I never feel bored anymore**, even when working on mundane tasks like data entry during the early days of starting my first business. By simply shifting my focus to the present moment, the sound of the keyboard clicking, the rhythm of my fingers typing, or even the small details on the screen, I find myself fully engaged, almost as if the boring task itself transforms into something fun. Mindfulness turns even the most tedious chores into opportunities for calm and presence, making boredom a thing of the past.

The third benefit of this 'superpower' is the ability to channel negative thoughts into positive ones. **When negativity creeps in,  whether it's anger, self-doubt, anxiety, frustration or depression,  mindfulness provides a way to pause and redirect those thoughts**. Instead of fighting them, I observe them without judgment by entering mindfulness, almost like watching clouds pass in the sky. This simple act creates space between me and the negativity, allowing me to 'quarantine' it. By doing so, **a setback becomes a lesson, a failure turns into growth, and uncertainty becomes a chance for curiosity**.

But of course, the ability to channel these negative thoughts is its own craft, requiring years of practice and patience to master. **Much like using an instrument to create beautiful music, mindfulness is merely a tool to orchestrate this great symphony of peace of mind**. It takes time to learn how to harmonize conflicting thoughts and emotions, to turn noise into melody. Mindfulness provides the foundation, but it’s through intentional practice and reflection that one can truly conduct this inner symphony, transforming life's chaos into a steady rhythm of balance and clarity.

The final benefit of this state of mindfulness is that your senses become much sharper. Colors appear more vivid, sounds feel richer, and even the texture of simple things, like the fabric of your clothes or the coolness of a breeze, becomes more noticeable. Simply put, it’s a higher level of awareness. **When you reach this state, you realize how limited your senses used to be, almost like an animal confined to a very narrow range of perception**. The world now feels bigger, richer, and more vibrant, and you can fully immerse yourself in the present moment like never before. You start to experience the world with a heightened awareness, as if a fog has been lifted. This heightened perception allows you to fully engage with the present moment, appreciating life’s subtle details that often go unnoticed. It’s like switching from a blurry, dim lens to crystal-clear, high-definition vision, making even the simplest experiences feel meaningful.

**Meditation is the most common practice to learn mindfulness** because it provides a structured way to train your mind to focus on the present moment. By setting aside time for meditation, you create a dedicated space to observe your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations without judgment. This practice develops the mental clarity and awareness that are at the heart of mindfulness. Meditation isn’t the only way to practice mindfulness, but it’s one of the most effective. Over time, the skills developed in meditation naturally expand into other areas of your life, allowing you to experience mindfulness in everything you do.

My path to mindfulness was accidental. I did not know what mindfulness meant until I had reached it by comparing the things I could do to what it enables. So, it might offer some insightful knowledge to those still on the journey to achieving it. One way to begin is by reaching the flow state through practicing a challenging skill first, to get a taste of how mindfulness feels, and then working from there to apply the same level of focus to every aspect of daily life, no matter how trivial. Another thing I did right was that I read a lot history and philosophy classics, with the [*Tao Te Ching*](https://www.taooflife.org/post/tao-te-ching-translation) being one of them. This, I believe, helped me significantly, although I understand that it’s not for everyone. In short, there is no fixed route to mindfulness. **Everyone walks a different path, so don’t try to find the “best way” or a “shortcut.” Instead, work with whatever resonates with you**.

Now the final stage before achieving enlightenment, it is something I vaguely sense but am not 100% sure of its existence, and I might not be able to get there even if it is real. Currently mostly based on my speculation, It is **the full ability to control consciousness at will.**

# Our conscious and subconscious mind

Our mind is made of consciousness and subconsciousness. According to most psychological models, the conscious mind represents only a small portion of our overall awareness, while the subconscious mind encompasses a much larger domain. The subconscious holds memories, beliefs, and patterns that are not actively in focus yet significantly influence our behavior. In essence, the conscious mind is like the visible tip of an iceberg, while the subconscious forms the vast majority hidden below the surface.

Once we reach a level where we can enter mindfulness at will, it becomes possible to explore the next step: attempting to control our consciousness. **While the subconscious mind may seem uncontrollable, it can still be influenced through conscious effort**. The subconscious can be understood as an accumulation of thoughts, ideas, beliefs, experiences, and memories formed over the years. By adjusting our perspective, which is an inherent function of consciousness, we can begin to ""make sense"" of this vast reservoir and indirectly shape its influence on our behavior and perceptions.

# So what does it mean to control the consciousness?

The first level of control over consciousness is the ability to pause and unpause it at will. In Taoism, *Zuowang (坐忘)*, or 'sitting and forgetting', is an essential spiritual practice that embodies this concept. **Zuowang represents a level beyond the practice of mindfulness**, where the practitioner seeks to stop the consciousness entirely instead of entering a flow state, a state of channeling all consciousness into a singular point of focus.

So, what is it like to stop your consciousness? I've only been able to achieve this for less than a couple of years. From my experience, you can make your mind 'blank' at will. **When the mind goes blank, you shift into the role of a pure observer, fully present to both the internal and external worlds**. Although not exactly the same, this state aligns with the 19th-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer's theory of the 'will-less' state, where one transcends desires and personal drives, entering a realm of pure perception and detached awareness.

There are obvious benefits to the ability to stop consciousness.

**The first benefit is that you gain almost full control over your temper, mood, and thoughts.** When negativity creeps in, you don’t need to channel these feelings elsewhere by redirecting your focus to a task or a thought, whether that’s achieving a flow state or practicing mindfulness. **You simply put a stop to consciousness itself, allowing those negative feelings to dissipate.** Individuals who attain this level of mastery over their consciousness will notice their temper becomes moderated and they develop immunity to provocation. **They will act spontaneously in any situation, no longer hindered by feelings of nervousness, intimidation, or awkwardness, which often stem from self-consciousness.**

Moreover, **these individuals do not feel the need to rise above others, to triumph over them, or to express themselves for validation**. Such desires typically arise from a consciousness driven by bodily urges, leading to a state of perpetual uneasiness, anxiety, and frustration. By relinquishing these needs, they create a sense of inner calm that allows for deeper self-awareness and a more harmonious existence.

This ability fosters an environment in which external pressures and societal expectations lose their grip. **Those who can stop consciousness often find themselves free from the burden of competing with others, enabling them to pursue their passions and interests for their own sake rather than for external approval**. This shift in perspective cultivates a kind of contentment that is neither dependent on success nor disturbed by failure.

As a result, they become more resilient in the face of life’s challenges. Without the constant fluctuations brought on by mood and desire, they can navigate adversities with a peace of mind. This newfound resilience allows them to engage with their surroundings fully, appreciating experiences as they come rather than filtering them through a lens of comparison or striving.

**Another good thing about being able to pause the consciousness is to fill the mind with pure happiness.**  By stopping the consciousness, the body and mind become one, and thus in perfect harmony with one another, **once this state is established, there are waves of joy spurt out from within the chest**. This state is much like an infant, whose consciousness is still undeveloped due to the absence of accumulated building blocks such as memory and experience. Like an infant, one returns to a state of pure being, untainted by mental clutter, judgments, or external pressures, experiencing life in its most natural and unfiltered form.

It is the pure form of happiness that requires no reason, no longer one needs the stimulation of earthly achievements such as money, power, and fame to be content.  Especially when the latter often bring more suffering than happiness. Speaking of which, let's reach a little further on the topic since we are already here. Does this mean we should not seek earthly success? The answer is that it doesn't matter, but we do need money for our overall well-being, so it is not a bad idea to seek money. As for the other two, it depends on the lifestyle you choose, if your path is politics, yes, then seek power; if you are an actor, your main practice is through acting, then yes, seek fame. What we seek is not important, the important thing is that we walk the path not sacrificing the true happiness. [The way to pursue money, power, and fame without compromising this core value is what Wu Wei practice all about, you can read more about it in this other article.](https://www.taooflife.org/post/what-is-wu-wei-and-why-it-is-good-for-us)

# The next level of controlling the consciousness is reconstruct the consciousness at will.

**Since I have yet to achieve this level, much of what I share below is based on speculation**. Following the ability to pause consciousness, the next natural step would likely involve the capacity to reconstruct it at will.

# What does it mean to reconstruct consciousness?

**First of all, consciousness relies on the continuous stream of information provided by the senses to exist**. The normal process of its formation is as follows: sensory inputs from the external world are collected, processed, and integrated into a coherent experience. These inputs are then interpreted by the mind, giving rise to thoughts, emotions, and an awareness of the present moment, collectively known as consciousness.

Reconstructing consciousness, on the other hand, represents the opposite process. **It is an advanced ability to control the mind so powerfully that it can actively influence and ""backfeed"" the senses, shaping the sensory experience according to the consciousness it chooses to reconstruct**. In this state, the practitioner reverses the flow of influence, using the mind to redefine perception, creating a subjective reality shaped by intentional thought rather than raw sensory data.

Does this sound too sci-fi? It’s not. In fact, **there’s a very common and age-old method of reconstructing consciousness called art**. Art, in all its forms, is a deliberate act of shaping perception, allowing the artist to implant their consciousness into the mind of their audience, effectively reconstructing it. This is why, when we immerse ourselves in a masterpiece, be it a symphony, a novel, a painting, or even a film, we momentarily forget our own existence. We are transported to a different time and space, experiencing the world as the creator once did.

Any skilled artist possesses the ability to transform their consciousness into sensory media, whether through sound, visuals, or words. However, it is the 'quality' of the consciousness they project that determines whether their work becomes popular, resonates deeply with others, or attains the status of a classic. Therefore, an artist passively waits for 'inspiration' to strike before transforming their consciousness into a medium of the senses, and their audience relies on this medium to passively reconstruct a very specific sample of consciousness. This is how we know that **artistic ability is not the same concept as the reconstruction of consciousness we are discussing here, but merely a specific example of it**. It also explains why being a great artist alone is not enough to reconstruct consciousness at will.

# What is it like to be able to reconstruct consciousness?

**The ability to reconstruct consciousness is so profound that the possessor of this gift can perceive the world through the eyes of others, both literally and metaphorically**. They gain the capacity to see what others see, feel what others feel, and experience reality from perspectives entirely different from their own. Remarkably, this ""others"" is not confined to human beings. Instead, **it transcends the human experience, extending its reach to all entities in existence**. From the smallest atom vibrating with its inherent energy to the vast, incomprehensible expanse of the universe, everything carries its own form of ""consciousness,""  a unique fingerprint shaped by its state, function, and existence within the cosmos.

**When one attains such an ability, their understanding of reality shifts from the limited confines of individuality to the limitless interconnectedness of all things**. They are no longer bound by their personal senses or self-centered awareness. Instead, they can tap into the universal flow of information, aligning themselves with the ""consciousness"" of any being, object, or system they desire. Just like Zhuangzi's dream of becoming a butterfly, **the boundaries between self and other begin to blur**. In his dream, Zhuangzi did not know whether he was Zhuangzi dreaming of being a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming of being Zhuangzi. This profound parable speaks to a truth about the nature of consciousness, its fluid, shifting, and interconnected form.

This ability dissolves barriers, leaving the practitioner with an intimate understanding of the fabric of existence, as if they were simultaneously the observer and the observed, the creator and the creation.[ In](http://creation.in/) this state, the boundaries between ""self"" and ""other"" evaporate. A rock, seemingly inanimate, reveals its ancient story through its molecular vibrations. A tree shares its silent dialogue with the wind and the whispers of the earth beneath its roots. A distant star, light-years away, projects its own consciousness through its pulsating energy, carrying tales of its birth, life, and eventual death. **Even the universe itself, vast and eternal, breathes with a consciousness so immense it defies comprehension, yet one who reconstructs consciousness can feel its pulse, like a faint echo reverberating through eternity**.

The implications of such an ability are staggering. **Imagine understanding the struggles of another person intimately, not just through empathy or observation, but by actually becoming them in a sense, albeit temporarily**. Grasping their fears, their joy, their pain, not as an outsider but as if they were your own. It shifts the notion of communication from mere words to a profound unity of understanding, a complete dissolution of misunderstanding. Beyond the human plane, it allows one to sync with the rhythm of nature, to understand and harmonize with ecosystems, and perhaps even tap into the wisdom of the universe, Tao,  itself.

Ultimately, to reconstruct consciousness is to engage in a sacred dance with existence. It is a journey that deepens one's relationship with the universe, revealing the truth that everything is connected, everything is alive in its own way, and everything has a story to tell, and through this ability, one can listen, understand, and even join that story, becoming a co-creator in the infinite tapestry of being.

# Beyond the ultimate control of consciousness

The flow state, mindfulness, and consciousness control are like Matryoshka dolls, where each subsequent layer contains the previous one. This means that the path to enlightenment is not linear. You reach the next level without leaving the previous one, which can be analogized to a pyramid structure, in which the previous level serves as the stepping stone, or foundation, for the next level.

**They serve as a toolkit for us to forge our path to enlightenment, the ultimate state of becoming one with Tao's manifestation in our universe — nature**. Once we have gathered all three tools, flow state, mindfulness, and consciousness control, we can apply them in our daily lives to uncover the profound meaning of the Tao.

To do this, **we begin by gathering building blocks: insights gleaned from reading, emotions stirred by appreciating art, music, and literature, reasoning developed through thinking, and feelings evoked by memories accessed during flow states**. Each of these components offers valuable perspectives and deepens our understanding of existence.

Using mindfulness, **we then organize these building blocks, cultivating an awareness that allows us to see how these elements interconnect**. Mindfulness encourages us to be present with our experiences, providing clarity and enhancing our ability to reflect on what we've gathered.

Finally, **we employ consciousness control to reconstruct our understanding of the universe's consciousness**. This transformative process enables us to weave together the insights and emotions we’ve collected, allowing us to perceive the richness of life through the lens of the Tao. By aligning ourselves with this universal consciousness, we not only gain deeper insights into our own existence but also foster a sense of unity with all that is.

In this way, our toolkit becomes a mean of exploration and connection, guiding us toward a more profound comprehension of Tao, the nature and our place within its vast manifestation. Only then can we say that we are enlightened.",1,1738258741.0,taoism,1,1.0,False

I've been trying to live a normal life but this has been a major setback. Since September I have not felt the same in my own body. I feel weak, numb and in constant discomfort. I've been sober from alcohol for months and taken minimal caffeine but eliminated tea, coffee and energy drinks. 

During the heart palpitations I also experienced bladder issues, my bladder would come out weak and I would have trouble starting and would stop and start during my stream. This has also gotten better since January but whenever I'm out it still shrivels in public and seems very shy and it doesn't always empty when I'm outside. 

Even though the days have gone where I would experience sudden drops in my blood pressure, rapid heart rate, weak (I mean super weak) shaky, tired from my heart palpitations a month ago. I am still experiencing heart palpitations, I can feel them when I sit down and I can feel them when I try rest my head. 

Is there some underlying anxiety and stress going on in my body? On the surface I don't tense up in social situations and people see me on the outside as a very confident autistic adult who can conduct myself but on the inside I'm fighting a constant battle with demons. 

So far I've done a blood test through my GP and they found nothing, I tried to get my GP to do another examination and they just used my words against me and dismissed my questions. Fuck my GP they got 2 star rating and they never seem to care. 

I forked out money for a private urologist. He was a good individual. Fortunately my lifestyle changes finally kicked in and my bladder started working again, I just don't know why it is so shy when I'm out...my urologist gave me a quote to go hospital but it would of costed me 2k and there was uncertainty whether they'd find anything wrong. 

I'm going to hypnotherapy tomorrow and next week I have a consultation about erectile dysfunction because I can't get morning wood. I'm also thinking of getting a doctor who specialises in heart palpitations but I fear that if my heart rate is good which I tested it out on an app and it came back normal, I fear there will be no treatment for me because I can't prove anything and it seems like a waste of money. 

Before I end I have a few questions on mind. 

If I still have my heart palpitations is it making my bladder shy and my body weak? 

What treatment should I require? 

Could I suffer from underlying anxiety and stress? 

I'm sure I have more questions on my mind but those are all I can think of now...

There may be no better opening line than this: “If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.”

Pretty much. 

This is not my first time on Reddit, but I decided to start over again with a throwaway account. And it is so hard to come up with new ways to say that same stuff about me over and over.

About me: educated, intelligent successful professional. Having said that, still kind of nerdy. My hobbies include staring directly at the sun and collecting dust. 

Just kidding.

I have a bunch of hobbies, but it mostly comes down to sports, reading (Lately non-fiction like Malcolm Gladwell, or Mary Roach, but, as you can tell, I like J.D. Salinger a lot. I also like classic science fiction, and many other genres.) and watching re-runs of TV shows I missed the first time around. I’m usually about five or ten years behind on TV shows. Maybe more. I just always seem to miss it the first time around. 

Here is some minutiae: 

*I have a perpetual crush on Emma Peel, as played by Diana Rigg in “The Avengers” TV show. 

*Cats are vicious killers of small mammals but they also are quite good at keeping your lap warm when you turn down the heat at night. 

*My Myers-Briggs Personality Type is INTJ.

*I have some 80s-ish tube socks, but I only wear them under my jeans because, while I find them amusing, they kind of embarrass me. 

*I don’t drink coffee.

Then, all of us—me, jiju, didi, mum, and my younger sister—went to the mall. Normally, I’d be drained by this point, but somehow, I was still in the mood to keep going. Jiju ended up buying two sweatshirts for himself and one for me (instant serotonin boost). After that, we went to McDonald’s, and I had piri piri fries, a Mexican McAloo Tikki burger, and a Coke—absolute comfort food.

I'm also 19 with a baby face. So here I am, fresh out of my 10 hour work day, beat. 

My clothes were dirty blue jeans, a completely wasted grey shirt, riddled with holes, burns, glue, and just really dirty in general, with tools hanging from my belt, a bandanna on my head, and a dirty jacket to top it all off. All this to say, I look like I just crawled on my hands and knees out of the aftermath of a tornado

I was already pretty tired, and I just needed to grab some groceries for dinner, so I went to Publix. I was toting a cart with several items in it and not paying much attention. That was when I saw this older lady with a little kid, 3-5 years old maybe. She seemed irate but I wasn't paying her much mind until she asked an associate nearby for help. He said something too quiet for me to hear, and then said he'd send someone else over to help this old lady. Let's say her name is Karen.

Karen waited impatiently for like maybe 2 minutes before this black girl came over. This wouldn't have been an important detail to any sane, level headed person, but it definitely upset Karen. She just got this uncomfortable look on her face, like she'd put a live beetle in her mouth. She said like, ""uh, no, I'd like someone else."" Which, we all know what that means. At this point though, Karen was visibly frustrated, due to the fact that she was ""being made to wait"" longer. This poor employee with the Publix uniform on had a very ""what do I do now"" look on her face, because Karen was still clearly upset, but refused to say anything else.

Karen eventually spots me standing down the aisle and accusatoraly points her finger at me. Lightning strikes somewhere in the distance. My fate is sealed. It was my fault, really, by glancing in her general direction, though. Without saying another word to the girl, Karen marches up to me with her kid in tow. ""You,"" she says, like an obese guy picking out his food at the local Carls Jr, nay, like Jeffrey Dhamer picking out his next victim. I gulp. 

She continues. ""I'd like you to help me. I need to know where the Sunflower seeds are, and I'm also looking for a child. I need you to tell me where I can purchase a human child. Yes, a human child? Can you do that you fat fucking idiot?"" Of course, not exactly what she said, but with all the intensity and condensation, it might've as well been. Just very heavy makeup, standing so close I can smell that old coffee, old people smell, and like, some tobacco product. And those eyes. God those eyes. She is now officially in my bubble, I can smell her and see her in 4k HD, and I'm not much liking it.

Hilariously, we were standing directly in front of the Sunflower seeds, which I silently pointed to, mouth agape with wonder and appal.

Her kid's starting to kind of look uncomfortable, kind of trying to twist out of Karen's grasp, starting to cry. At this point I'm wondering if she did this at another store, and that's how she obtained this kid who looked too young to be hers.

I was still just more or less appalled and tired, so I just said, ""lady, I don't work here."" She scoffed and lifts up this struggling kid into the cart. ""Put me down mommy"" the kid protests, and now I'm just disappointed that she's not some deranged child snatcher and is, instead, just an entitled parent.

""Ma'am, look what I'm wearing. Do I look like I work at Publix?"" She just stared at me with a mix of confusion and self ritious rage. ""You do work here,"" she says.

1idsaq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1idsaq4/rf_factory_reset/,[RF] Factory Reset,"*Dear Senator Tooley,*

*This is a letter to inform you that your annual diagnostic test indicates that* ***your brain is almost full***. To protect against future performance loss, we urge you to free up storage space immediately at one of our six convenient locations.

*Sincerely,*

*WaveTech Technology*

Senator David Tooley had read the letter a dozen times. He still didn’t understand it. I mean, he wasn’t entirely surprised that his brain was running out of space. He was, after all, a U.S. Senator and many people regularly told him how intelligent he was.

“MELINDA!”

Melinda was David’s favorite aide, a curvy Puerto Rican he had plucked from obscurity at last year’s Girls Nation Conference.

“Find out if WaveTech is real and if my brain is really running out of space, and if it *is* really running out of space, find out how they could possibly know that.”

He handed her the letter and off she went.

One might think this was the strangest assignment he’d given Melinda in his first term as the junior senator from the commonwealth of Virginia. Far from it. After a recent meeting with an animal rights group, he asked her if she could track down “the sword part” of a swordfish so he could feel the tip and see if it was truly as sharp as an actual sword or if the seafood industry was using deceptive naming practices to boost sales.

(It turned out they are that sharp and the senator’s curiosity ended with a trip to the Capitol Urgent Care.)

Melinda returned before lunch with an answer to his questions.

“WaveTech is a real company. Your father was an A-round investor in the late 90s. As a thank you, WaveTech has been monitoring your brain with a small chip they implanted in your ear canal when you were eleven. And yes, according to their latest scan, your brain is critically low on storage.”

David stared back blankly. He wasn’t sure what he should do with this information. And the fact he didn’t know what to do only worried him more. Perhaps that indecision in itself was a sign of just how fragile he was.

“Make me an appointment,” he blurted out, his heart starting to flutter with his far too familiar anxiety. “And don’t tell Rochelle. Or *Erica*.”

Rochelle was the senator’s loyal wife and mother to his two middle schoolers. Erica was the senator’s twenty-seven-year-old girlfriend. The senator had been promising Erica for eight months that she was the *true* love of his life and that Rochelle’s days were numbered. But now he worried that it was *he* whose days were numbered. And if Erica knew he was unlikely to live long enough to become an entrenched DC incumbent with the financial means to bankroll her own aqua yoga studio, he might find out just how seriously she takes that “FAFO” tattoo on her right ankle.

David skipped his morning Budget Committee meeting and drove himself to WaveTech’s Maryland office for a 10am appointment. An armed security guard ushered him through an empty lobby lined with paintings of Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton and Marie Curie and into a warmly lit consultation room furnished with a pair of black, square, leather chairs and a perfect white orchid on a marble side table. “It’s a Beautiful Day” played from an unseen speaker.

“How nice to see you again.”

Senator Tooley turned to find a gentle woman in her 60s, sporting a lab coat and holding an iPad. “I’m Dr. Simons.”

David rose and shook her hand. She had just applied vanilla hand lotion and for a moment their right palms were congealed together in slippery symbiosis. “Have we… met before?” he asked.

“1998,” she said. “You thought you were getting your tonsils out. Instead… we were putting something in.”

David should have been disturbed to hear this but he wasn’t. Dr. Simons was so comforting, so maternal, and deep in that jam-packed brain of his he remembered her voice. “So I… still have my tonsils?” he wondered.

Dr. Simons laughed. “Indeed. But we gave you ice cream anyway.”

She sat knee to knee with David and looked deep into his soul. “Your father took no pleasure in lying to you. But you don’t get to be one of the richest men in America without taking risks. At the time of his investment, our technology was largely unproven. Now using microchips to tap into brain activity and maximize one’s potential is almost banal, as they say.”

“True,” David said.

In all honesty, David couldn’t remember what “banal” meant. And Dr. Simons’ implication that “they” were all saying it made him feel even more insecure about the state of his intellect.

“So how bad is it?” he asked. “My brain, that is.”

Dr. Simons pulled up a live shot of David’s gray matter on her iPad. It looked like a radar report over a thunderstorm. Oranges and reds and yellows pulsing with activity.

“This is you,” she said. “As you can see, there is a lot going on. In fact, you have the most active hippocampus I’ve ever recorded.”

“Oh no,” he said.

“That’s not a bad thing,” she said. “The hippocampus regulates emotions and stores memories, it helps with spatial awareness, problem solving... The issue is that, as you can probably tell from this scan, things in there are a little… *tight*.”

David couldn’t tell anything. What he could feel was the first twinges of a migraine. Or maybe it was something worse. Was this another sign? Was this meeting pushing his brain beyond its natural capacity? Would his skull split open right then and there and his hippocampus ooze onto Dr. Simons’ fancy leather chairs?

“But we can fix it,” she explained. “It’s simply a matter of offloading unnecessary data.”

She flipped away from the brain scan to a pie chart with dozens of colors to it. “There are a lot of unimportant things we can lose here,” she said. “See that small blue sliver?”

David looked closer at the pie chart.

“Those are stored Nintendo cheat codes from your childhood,” she explained.

“Oh sure,” David said. “Up up down down left right left right B A select.”

Dr. Simons smiled. “And see that medium green slice?”

David nodded.

“That is a detailed business plan for an oven-baked sandwich shop.”

“When I was younger I dreamed of opening one. I was going to call it--”

Dr. Simons already knew the answer: “Tooley’s Toasties.”

“Exactly.” David shook his head in amazement. “Okay, what’s that giant red wedge?”

“Pornographic images.”

“Oh.”

“The good news is we can delete them. In fact, I estimate when we’re done with our sweep we can easily free up forty-six percent more space in your brain.”

David was speechless.

“David, do you know all the knowledge you could absorb with forty-six percent more brain space?”

David shook his big full head.

“You could become the smartest man in the United States Congress.”

Senator David Tooley smiled as he stared past Dr. Simons. *The smartest man in Congress…*

He pondered what he could do with such an advantage. He’d never lose another argument. Which would open up committee chair positions. Which would allow him to push through any legislation he wanted. Which meant he could funnel millions of dollars from Washington D.C. to his home state. Which meant he could eventually funnel millions of dollars into his own pocket. Which meant Erica could finally have her aqua yoga studio.

“Let’s do it,” he said.

Dr. Simons pushed a green button on the wall and a blonde nurse entered with a glass of mint-infused water. She pulled a lever and David’s black leather chair flattened into a recliner.

“Oh. We’re doing this now?”

“Offloading only takes thirty minutes. And it’s painless. I just need a credit card and a release form.”

“Right. Um. How much money are we talking here?”

Dr. Simons, now standing, looked down at him in the recliner. “Normally we charge eight-five thousand dollars. But because your father was an early investor, I’ve been given permission to offer you a fourteen percent discount.”

David tried to figure out the math. He couldn’t. But so what, he thought. Once this was done, he could become great at math. He could become great at everything. Any money spent today would be made back tenfold on the other side of the offloading. *You don’t get rich without taking risks*, Dr. Simons had said.

“I’ll put it on my work card,” he said, handing her his Visa. If upgrading your noggin wasn’t a legitimate senatorial business expense, David didn’t know what was.

The nurse turned his head to the side, filled a small bulb syringe with mint water, and squeezed it into his ear.

“The water helps make an electric connection to the chip,” Dr. Simons explained.

David nodded. This all felt right. He couldn’t wait to tell Erica. She would be so proud of him. She always said how smart he was. She said he was the smartest man she’d ever done aqua yoga with, which was really saying something since Erica’s client list included two Supreme Court Justices. And if Erica thought he was that smart *before* the offloading, he could barely imagine what would she think of him after the--

“Oh darn.”

Dr. Simons said it quietly. But loud enough that David could hear it through his ear that wasn’t filled with mint water.

“Everything okay?”

“Darn darn.”

“Dr. Simons?”

She didn’t respond. David’s head was tilted so he could only see her Gucci sneakers shuffling nervously as she told the blonde nurse to run and find a charging cord.

Seconds later, the nurse was yelling from the next room. “USB-C or lightning?!”

“I DON’T KNOW!”

That was the last thing Senator Tooley remembered.

He woke up two hours later to see Dr. Simons looking down at him with a nervous smile. “How we feeling?”

David smiled back. “I feel… rad.”

Dr. Simons’ face fell. Not the answer she was hoping for. She pulled David’s chair back into the upright position and knelt down in front of him.

“Here’s the deal…” she began. “We had a bit of a power issue when we were doing your offloading.”

“Okay.”

“My iPad died.”

“Okay.”

“And when it rebooted, there was some data loss.”

“Okay.”

“In your brain.”

“Well like… how much?”

“It was a full factory reset.”

David didn’t know what that meant. And Dr. Simons struggled to find the proper words to explain it. But, in short, Senator David Tooley’s brain had been rebooted to its original 1998 settings.

“I reversed the charge on your Visa,” Dr. Simons added.

David sat in stunned silence.

“Would you like some ice cream?”

David took his two scoops to go and walked down the hall toward the exit. You might assume he felt angry. Or panicky. But David felt… surprisingly calm.

But really it wasn’t a surprise. Because David was never anxious as a child. He never worried about anything. That only came when his older brother got sick and his dad went to prison for the largest insider trading scandal in American history and people he had never met before put their hands on David’s shoulder and told him that only he could salvage the Tooley family name.

The expectation to be his own family’s savior was a heavy burden and gave birth to a variety of fears. Fear of failure. Fear of being exposed as “the dumb son” who only graduated college because Dad made a phone call. Fear of disappointing his mom and his wife and his kids. And from the fear flowed resentment and various addictions and, in time, the most dangerous side effect of all: success.

But all that baggage was lost in the factory reset. Like a boat that had been scraped clean of its barnacles, David Tooley sped home unencumbered, in possession of his memories but freed from a lifetime of dysfunction and deceptions. He was, in the most important of ways, a new man.

His wife Rochelle met him in the kitchen. “Who the bleep is *Erica*?”

“Oh.” As a trained politician, David would have typically met the accusation with a creative lie and then a counterattack, but the reset had erased all such skills. “Erica is my girlfriend,” he answered.

“Get out,” she said.

That was fair. He drove to his office on Capitol Hill where he tossed and turned on his couch until morning.

Melinda arrived at 8am to shuttle him to his Budget Committee meeting. She was armed with coffee and egg whites. David pushed them away. He requested Froot Loops.

For the next hour, David sat with the committee’s twenty-one other members, slowly stirring his technicolor milk, thoroughly bored as lawyers and staffers “buttoned up” a 2,000 page omnibus bill. He couldn’t track most of what was happening, and most of the other senators didn’t even try. Some scrolled their phones or played Wordle. One elderly senator stared at the floor as an aide stood at the ready, wiping his chin when needed.

Eventually, David nodded off, his hand tipping his Froot Loops bowl, sending a surge of blue and red and yellow milk onto the desk in front of him. He snapped to attention, using pages from the bill to mop up the mess before it reached his pants. Crisis averted, he found himself staring at page 743:

*83.c.IV - Allocates a sum of $5,000,000,000 (five billion) to the Amazonian Freedom Fund for immediate use.*

Could that be right. Five BILLION dollars? His purified brain knew that was a big number.

“What is this?” David asked.

The room quieted.

“83 dot… c dot… roman numeral 4?”

A lawyer piped in. “Yes, Senator, that line item funds an embedded group of freedom fighters in South America committed to… destabilizing hostile governments.”

“Isn’t that, like, a lot of money?”

“This is a vetted group, sir--”

“I’m just saying in Contra it only takes two guys to do that exactly same thing. And all they need are big guns and an unlimited supply of ammo.”

The group stared back, more or less matching the look of the drooling senator in the corner.

“You guys don’t remember Contra? From the original NES system? What was that cheat code…” He couldn’t remember it. He pressed on. “I’m just saying five billion dollars could be better spent somewhere else. Or… like… not at all?

David’s phone buzzed in his lap, breaking the silence. He looked down as a string of texts rolled in from Erica.

He escaped to the hall and started reading:

ru mad at me???

u dont understand. I HAD to text rochelle.

u gave me no choice!

I didn’t hear from you ALL afternoon. I thought you wre ghosting me.

Yr not right? 😂

But idk maybe this is a good thing. You keep saying you “wanted” to tell her. Now she knows. Now WE can move forward.

TOGETHER. XOXOX.

that is what u want, right?

if it isn’t I’ll die. You know that right?

fr

I will DIE.

but not b4 I post photos of us together on my aqua yoga IG account.

dont make me do that babe.

I don’t want 2.

All I just is YOUUUUU.

*Oh God,* David realized… *My girlfriend is a crazy person*.

He felt a sensation creep up from his heart and into his head.

David was too naive to know it was fear.

Which is when Ron Billums, the senior senator from Colorado, emerged from the committee room. His eyes were locked on David.

“Hi Ron…”

“We need your vote to get this thing out of committee,” he said bluntly.

“I don’t think I can do that.”

“David, this bill is vital to the well-being of millions of hardworking Americans.”

“But a lot of what’s in it just seems… stupid.”

“The only thing stupid right now is you.”

David’s chest tightened. “I don’t know…”

Senator Billums sighed. “David, what if I could promise you a fifty million dollar grant to the Tooley Center for Democracy.”

“The Tooley Center for Democracy? Is that a thing?”

“It can be.”

“What would the Tooley Center for Democracy do?”

“Whatever your board of directors wants it to do.”

“It sounds kinda sketchy.”

“It’s perfectly legal and it’s a wonderful way to honor your father.”

“He was kinda shady too.”

Senator Billums stepped closer and placed his hand on David’s shoulder. “Don’t act like a child, David. This is the kind of opportunity that not many people get -- the chance to restore your family to their former glory.”

David couldn’t ignore the pressure in his head now. He could feel his eyelids twitching. His throat was dry.

“Just say yes and all your problems go away,” the senior senator whispered.

But David knew that wasn’t true. He had said yes to all sorts of things he shouldn’t have said yes to. And because of it, his brain had been reset, his wife hated him, and his girlfriend was ready to out him as an adulterer on Instagram.

“I’m a definite no, Ron.”

David drove home that night. The front door was locked so he rang the bell.

Rochelle answered but said nothing.

“I screwed up. In a lot of ways. More than I probably even know. You’re right to be hurt. And mad. You can be mad for a year if you want. I’ll take it. But I’m not gonna leave. I’m gonna be different. I kinda hope I already am.”

He took a blanket and slept in the living room. The next day, David resigned from the Senate. By the time Erica tried to cancel him, he was already irrelevant.

\---

The following January, a new oven-baked sandwich shop opened in Virginia Beach. Tooley’s Toasties. There was no grand opening. On most days David worked the kitchen while Rochelle manned the register. After school their kids would do homework at the counter and drink soda till Rochelle cut them off.

Two months in and they still hadn’t turned a profit. It was hard. Business was slow, especially in the winter. The mail came in the late afternoon. David waved to the postal worker and leafed through a stack of bills he wasn’t sure he could pay. At the bottom of the pile was a letter with a familiar letterhead.

*Dear David,*

*During a recent audit, our team discovered an offshore server containing timed backups of various clients’ brains. We are happy to inform you that* ***your brain backup was among those found.***

*Please contact us at your earliest convenience and we will be happy to restore you to your pre-reset status at no charge.*

*Sincerely,*

*Dr. Simons*

David considered the offer. Then he looked around the shop. At his wife. And his kids. Then David Tooley threw the letter into the sandwich oven and watched it burn.",1,1738258104.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I’ve eaten an extremely clean and strict diet most of my life but even more so in recent years. No history of any GI issues save for an occasional stomach bug.

I’ve been on multiple antibiotics over the years and have never had any issues, I eat extra fermented foods/take probiotics a couple hours away from the antibiotics during the times I’m on them and, more recently, I started taking digestive enzymes.

About a week after the Azithromycin, I was put on Bactrim. I had yet another respiratory illness and had coughed up some bloody phlegm. I could not tolerate the Bactrim and it made me feel horrible so the doctor switched me to doxycycline and I felt better. 

However, one day I had noticed “thats weird I haven’t pooped in 24 hours…”  which had never happened to me before in my life. And about 12 hours later I had a brick like stool pass. I could quite literally see a line in the stool where it went from 27 years of healthy to completely compacted and constipated. It was also tan colored. 

Since that day my GI system has been altered. I’ve seen specialists, tried any and every supplement, dietary change, OTC constipation remedy, had a HIDA scan, stool sample, Colonoscopy, CT scan, ETC. there doesn’t seem to be any rhyme or reason to my change and getting any doctor to hear me or help me is nearly impossible.

I also have found that more recently the stools themselves might even be soft due to the supplements/prunes/miralax I take but it will sit in my gut for days. When I’ve had CT scans they always come back that my GI system is backed up. 


I should also mention that certain foods have become completely off limits: last year when this started I was unable to consume anything with nuts or seeds, any sort of chocolate or coffee and any sort of cheese. I mean that if I had a single chocolate chip, a single almond my system would shut down.  Not just that it would get slightly worse, that it would immediately shut down. At some point this past fall I started being able to have chocolate again for some reason without issue.

*******

This is an ongoing series designed to teach people about 
crypto safety using stories.

These stories have been changed to protect the identity of the victim but are very much based in real world scenarios and describe an instance where a crypto asset owner got their wallet drained due to hostile actors.

Underneath is what the user could have done to avoid the hack.

The goal is to learn from other people's mistakes.

If you have any ideas for future stories, let me know in the comments.

Let's continue.

Victim: 28 year old woman

Scenario:  Claire was a long term trencher.  She was there when $HUSTLE kicked out their developer after the incident with condensed milk, a coconut, and RatPoo coffee in an X space.  She was there when $COTTONTAIL went from a 90% dip to a 10% gain in 2 hours.

She was battle hardened and ready to take her crypto experience to the next level.  She wanted her Lotus and villas in Italy because fuck Lambos.

Claire also had a contrarian streak a mile wide.

Claire was thinking about the Prague incident while doing her Good Morning rounds on X and saw a post from Professor Fuckery, one of the best degens in the space.  

The Professor was creating a new Telegram channel and wanted only the best and brightest of the crypto space.

Claire sent him an application within minutes.

One of the Professor's assistants responded to her and began the interview and onboarding process.

A week, 2 interviews, providing her public wallet address, and a 5 paragraph essay later she was sitting in one of the most intense Telegram channels she had ever experienced.

The atmosphere was electric.  People were talking about new tokens coming out of pump fun and arguing over a ""Moon score"".  

Claire was sent a link to the FAQ and she found out that the Moon score was the Professor's secret sauce.

He had a feed that listed every pump fun coin that was issued.  His system took that feed and evaluated how likely it was for the token's price to Moon based on a variety of factors such as tokenomics, similar pre existing tokens, and so forth.

Claire looked up an asset that had a high Moon score and bought $500 worth of $TINJO, a fundraiser for some DJ.  

It got up to $1500 total value before she got a notification from the TG channel that she needed to sell due to a sudden Moon score deterioration.

She sold and the price immediately started tanking.  

When she asked she was informed that they monitored all of the members' wallets and when they saw that one of their tokens went below a certain Moon score, they were notified.

Claire was hooked.

One day she got a notification that everyone needed to be around tomorrow for a special announcement.

The Professor himself came on to tell everyone that he was going to organize a take over of $DUCKEDUP, an old attempt by a car company to promote their product using crypto.

They would then promote it, it would moon and they all would make millions.

Unfortunately to make millions you need money and the fee to get in on the CTO was $200k.  

The good news is that the Professor was willing to front the seed money as a loan as long as it was over collateralized by 10%.

Claire agreed and put $210k of her assets into a custom smart contract that would release her funds once she paid  back the loan.

She transferred her tokens, the result of years of work into the smart contract.

Three days later everyone in the channel was watching the relaunch with baited breath.

It worked!  $DUCKEDUP immediately started to rise and erase zeroes.  .00008, .0008, .008, .08, .15..

She could see her balance grow exponentially.

And then she felt a shift in the channel, a disturbance in the Force.  She decided to take some profits and was immediately asked to cycle back into $DUCKEDUP, a request she ignored.

It continued to go up.  .30, .35.   She thought about doing what she was told but..nah. She went ahead and transferred her profits, and everything else except her $210k that was locked away, into her CryptoFort account.

Things stated to go red when the price hit .42.  

The token dropped from .42 to .00000042 in seconds.

The Professor then banned everyone and deleted all of his social media.  

In the later episode about the matter by EspressoDog on YouWatch his analysis showed that Professor Fuckery made off with $15m total.

Claire turned off the video, her hands shaking from a panic attack.  She looked at her CoinFort account one more time.  

Her old assets were gone but because she took profits, she was up $1k.

And she had an undying hatred of Professor Fuckery.

How to avoid:  The main point of this story is to show just how elaborate some of these schemes can get.  

Everything about this is social engineering.

The super elaborate application process is designed to lock people in and disguise the ask for the public wallet.  The initial trades were a mix of creative purchases and actual analysis.  Announcing the CTO in channel was a way to generate pressure to buy in and make the ""loan"" seem fair.  Having everyone in the channel when the coin dropped was a way to exert pressure for people to hodl until it was too late.

The way to avoid this is to always be skeptical of anything that seems odd, like a custom smart contract loan when you can just go to a lending platform like AAVE for the same thing.

Stay vigilant.

1ids3aq,https://www.reddit.com/r/dtfprintings/comments/1ids3aq/customizing_more_than_just_tshirts_unique_ways_to/,Customizing More Than Just T-Shirts: Unique Ways to Use DTF Transfers,"DTF (Direct-to-Film) transfers have revolutionized the world of custom printing. While they’re often associated with t-shirts, their versatility goes far beyond just apparel. DTF transfers can adhere to a wide range of surfaces, opening up endless creative possibilities for businesses and DIY enthusiasts alike. If you’re looking for ways to expand your product line or personalize more than just shirts, here are some unique ways to use DTF transfers.

**1. Tote Bags: Stylish and Functional**

Tote bags are a staple in everyday life, whether for grocery shopping, carrying books, or running errands. Customizing tote bags with DTF transfers allows you to create trendy, eye-catching designs that stand out. Since DTF prints work on cotton, polyester, and blended fabrics, you can use them on a variety of bag materials without worrying about adhesion issues.

Ideas for DTF tote bags:

* Motivational quotes or aesthetic typography
* Personalized monograms or names
* Seasonal and holiday-themed designs
* Business branding for promotional giveaways

**2. Hats: Stand Out with Custom Headwear**

Hats are a great way to make a fashion statement or promote a brand. While embroidery is often the go-to for custom hats, DTF transfers offer a more detailed, colorful, and cost-effective alternative. Whether you’re working with snapbacks, dad hats, or beanies, DTF transfers allow for intricate graphics without the hassle of stitching.

Pro tip: Since hats have a curved surface, use a hat heat press to ensure proper adhesion when applying DTF transfers.

**3. Shoes: Step Up Your Customization Game**

Shoes might not be the first thing that comes to mind for DTF transfers, but they’re a fantastic canvas for unique designs. Sneakers, slip-ons, and even canvas boots can be customized with high-quality DTF prints. Whether you want to add logos, artwork, or patterns, DTF allows for vibrant and long-lasting prints.

Popular custom shoe ideas:

* Personalized name or initials on sneakers
* Floral or graffiti-style designs for a trendy look
* Matching shoes for couples, friends, or teams

**4. Denim Jackets: A Fashionable Canvas**

Denim jackets have always been a fashion staple, and custom designs make them even more special. With DTF transfers, you can create bold, artistic designs that showcase your personality or brand. Unlike embroidery or screen printing, DTF allows for highly detailed images, making it ideal for artistic and intricate designs.

DTF denim design ideas:

* Vintage-inspired patches and typography
* Custom band or music festival artwork
* Streetwear-style designs with bold graphics and quotes

**5. Home Decor: Customizing Pillowcases and Fabric Banners**

DTF printing isn’t just for wearable items—it can also be used to create custom home decor pieces. Pillowcases, table runners, and fabric banners can all be customized with unique DTF designs, making them perfect for home styling, holiday decor, or even gifts.

Creative home decor ideas:

* Custom pillowcases with family names or quotes
* Holiday banners featuring seasonal artwork
* Baby name banners for nurseries
* Wedding or event signage on fabric

**6. Laptop Cases and Tech Accessories**

For those who love personalized accessories, DTF transfers can be applied to fabric laptop sleeves, tablet cases, and even mousepads. These items make great personalized gifts or promotional products for businesses.

Popular DTF designs for tech accessories:

* Custom business logos for branding
* Personalized monograms or initials
* Inspirational quotes for work or school

**7. Custom Workwear and Aprons**

If you run a business or know someone who does, DTF transfers are perfect for creating custom uniforms, aprons, and workwear. Whether for coffee shops, salons, bakeries, or craft businesses, customized apparel enhances brand identity and professionalism.

Workwear ideas:

* Barista or chef aprons with business logos
* Salon smocks with professional branding
* Work jackets for tradespeople with custom name tags

DTF transfers are changing the game when it comes to customization. While t-shirts are the most common use, the potential for creativity goes far beyond apparel. Whether you’re customizing tote bags, shoes, denim jackets, or home decor, DTF printing provides vibrant, durable, and high-quality results that set your products apart.

1ids35n,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransIreland/comments/1ids35n/my_experience_with_dr_ahern/,My experience with Dr Ahern,"I was really hoping to be able to post my positive experience with this clinic on here someday but today is not that day lol.

I was referred to Dr Ahern's 'Gender Incongruence' clinic last year after I requested that my GP do so for me. After reading about other people's experiences, I was really hesitant about putting in the request but I was also extremely desperate. I'm on low income so accessing HRT privately really wasn't an option for me. I've been out as trans for many years now and the wait times for the NGS are only getting longer - so I said I would give seeing Ahern through the public system a shot.

I heard back a couple of weeks later with an appointment date for the following month - which was incredibly surprising to me. I was expecting to be waiting anywhere between months to years to see him. Obviously super stoked to finally be on my way to accessing the care I need, I attended my first (and last) appointment with the main man himself.

The appointment itself went fine. He read out questions and explained things in a way that made it seem like he had done this a thousand times before and that he was somewhat over it. While it was kind of hurtful, I ignored it because I figured it would be worth it in the end.

He explained that the way that he chooses to do things is by starting his patients off with some courses of Leuprorelin for a couple of months, then Testosterone via gel after that. I tried enquiring about the Leuprorelin (I'm 29 FTM, not really the typical candidate for blockers) and he just explained what they do - not really explaining why he saw it necessary. The appointment felt very rushed - may or may not have had anything to do with the fact that he arrived to his office half an hour after my appointment was due to start with coffee in hand.

He told me that I would need two things to start HRT through his clinic; a letter from a psychologist stating that I'm trans and some blood tests. I confided in him regarding my income situation and asked if he knew of some less expensive options in terms of psychs. He was kind enough to provide me with a general list that he seems to work off of and marked off one Dr in particular who he said charged €70 per session - said there should be no more that 3 - 4 sessions. He told me that my follow up appointment with him would be posted out to me and that I didn't need to do anything on that front. I had my blood tests done at the same hospital 2 weeks later.

I did some of my own research on Leuprorelin once I got home and the majority of people see it as an unnecessary step in the journey for someone like me, as all it would do is stop my periods and essentially initiate an early menopause, something Testosterone does on its own minus the menopause. It's not common practice. Another endo I spoke with said it was likely to do more harm than good, as devoiding someone of hormones completely can have effects on bone density. While this is the information that I have sourced, I encourage everyone to do their own research etc. should they find themselves in the same position as me. If you're able to get information out of Ahern as to why exactly he sees it as necessary, even better. And I would love to hear it!

I contacted the psych he recommended and she advised that her sessions are in fact NOT €70 per session, but €600 for two sessions - half upfront. While this might be reasonable for some, this is not a rate I can commit to paying. Unfortunately she was the one charging the least on the list that he provided me with.

Luckily (lol), I was seeing a psych regarding my mental health through the public system during this time. I had asked them for one before on my own accord but they had refused. After speaking with my GP, they agreed to provide the report to Ahern directly ONLY, and weren't willing to give it to me so I could pass it on to him - their reason and words were ""we don't want you to use this report to avail of unapproved forms of healthcare"". As it's impossible to get in touch with the gender clinic, I haven't exactly been able to tell them to contact them - so dead-end there basically.

With all that's happened so far, I decided to go with an online informed consent HRT provider last November. Since then, I have been trying to get a hold of the blood test results I had done in Drogheda so I could use them. I tried requesting them, my GP tried requesting them - nothing. My GP called me earlier today to say that he decided to give the hospital one last call before arranging for me to get a new set of blood tests done. They finally told him that the blood tests that I had done had not been processed properly - hence why it was proven impossible to get the results. No one had called to inform me - not the lab, not the clinic. Whenever I had been in touch with the lab, they told me that the results had been sent over already! Which they clearly hadn't been! Because they didn't exist!

I still haven't heard from Ahern's clinic in terms of a follow up appointment or anything. Tbh I highly doubt I'm even still on his list of patients.

I have my appointment for new blood tests via my GP next week. I hope to start hrt through Imago as soon as I get the results. I don't really have the funds but I would rather be on hrt and not have much of a social life than carry on this way for much longer. I wholeheartedly hope that current and future patients attending Ahern's clinic are able to access the care that they're looking for & that their experiences are easier and more pleasant. It's possible that I've just had terrible luck with my overall experience but it's been enough to make me not want to continue pushing to try and get treatment this way.

  
TLDR: First appointment with Ahern wasn't great. Impossible to contact the clinic. You probably won't get far without forking out a couple of hundred to get a report done by a psych. The hospital didn't process my blood tests properly and nobody let me know about it. I'm tired of having to fight for nothing so I'm going to try accessing healthcare somewhere else.",6,1738257587.0,TransIreland,0,1.0,False

I would love to have the ability to have another level under these.  Like under Restaurants, you could have Sit-Down, Fast Food, etc.  

Another example would be under Income->Paychecks, I'd like to create subcategories underneath that to be able to split up my paychecks from my wife's paychecks.  And my business income (I'm a photographer), instead of just all of it being 'Business Income', it would be nice to have subcategories of Wedding, Family, Senior etc.

I am gay, I haven’t really told anyone except for my mum. Me and my friends went on a trip (they don’t know about me) and I decided to download Grindr because we live in a very small town and I was always scared of meeting up there, for someone to see me etc. 
So I talked with a few guys, most conversations either started off really fast as in xxx pics without anything else said or they ended really quickly. The first guy I talked with and met with was also 18. We met at his dad’s store after hours and he was cute. We talked for some time, had a drink and started kissing, touching and I sucked my first dick for the first time. I liked the feeling and the taste though he wasn’t really experienced I think cause he was I bit rough and didn’t really touch me or anything so I didn’t cum.
  The next day I started talking with this other guy. He didn’t have a pic of himself or his age open but he was actually really sweet. He told me he is older than me, he is 42. we talked for hours. After that he asked if I wanted to meet up at his place, and that there was no pressure if I didn’t want to or that he wouldn’t pressure me to do anything, and to just meet since I had never hang with anyone who knew I was gay or was gay himself.
After a few hours of insistent high heart rates and headache for the indecisiveness I agreed to meet. 
  
  I went to his house around 5pm. I was really scared but also excited. We hang at the living room at first, had coffee, I drank a soda, and we really only talked at first. He asked me if I wanted to go cause I looked really nervous. I said no, and that I have never done this before. He told me I’m really cute and got a bit closer. He asked me if it is okay to touch me and started massaging my leg/thigh. I just nodded cause I couldn’t really speak, no one had ever touched me before. He stopped cause I think he realised I was nervous and we kept talking. 
  
At some point I relaxed and we started again, I couldn’t help but keep staring at his shorts(oh I forgot he only wore shorts) and the bulge on them. He took my hand and put it on it. It was huge, and the whole experience was so much more different than yesterday. I leaned closer and let him touch me and I was touching his bulge. 
  
He asked me if I wanted to take his shorts off and I did. He told me to touch it. He made incredible sounds just from jerking off and he started undressing me too. After jerking him off at some point he grabbed hold of my head and guided me down. I told him I didn’t know what to do and told me to just go for it and see how it feels and we can stop anytime and he would tell me what to do. I started sucking him. He was touching all of my body telling me how pretty I am and how well I am taking his cock and when to lick more, suck more etc basically teaching me how to suck cock and pushing my head up and down. At some point I got really into it cause he had stopped talking or even guiding my head and I realised I was doing everything alone and must have been doing sth good cause he was moaning and I was rock hard too. I took off my boxers and startled jerking off to it(who knew sucking dick was so hot). 
  
He told me to stop and I thought I might have done sth wrong but he told me to go to the bedroom cause we would be more comfortable there. Once we got there he started kissing me again, and guided me on the bed and got on top off me. He started kissing and licking me all over and it was really hot. He jerked me off for a little bit too but he told me he didn’t like sucking cock and I told him it’s okay. I asked him if I could suck his again. He told me to lie down and we got on 69 only he wasn’t really sucking my cock and only fucking my mouth. 
  
I won’t lie and say it wasn’t the greatest experience I had had just the smell of his cock and balls and him going ball deep.
  
Then he licked my hole. I was surprised but I couldn’t really say anything cause I had his dick in my mouth. He kept licking and started pushing a finger in and asked if it was okay. I couldn’t really answer but I didn’t want to risk stopping in case I said no. It felt weird to have a finger in my hole, I had never tried it before.
  We stopped 69 and he got me on all four and started eating my hole and it was amazing. He would switch between fingering me and eating my hole. 
  
He stopped again and I thought(hoped) he might want me to suck him off again but instead I felt the tip of his cock grazing my entrance. I got nervous and told him again I am a virgin but he told me he wasn’t going to enter me and just wanted to feel the ass and he would stop if I was uncomfortable. I nodded and said okay. He would graze it on my hole, slightly push it but not really put it in.
He would spit on my ass and push the tip on my hole and I guess I was also wiggling my ass on it to test how it feels. At some point he pushed in and the head popped in.

It felt weird. I froze and he apologised. I told him it was okay and he probably mistook me saying it was okay cause he pushed deeper and I don’t know why but I didn’t stop him. He asked if I wanted to put a condom on and again in my nervousness I said “I don’t know” and he said it is better without one and I just said okay. He got balls deep and laid on top of me and kissed me and it was nice. It hurt a little but it felt really nice being kissed and caressed and hugged. He kept asking me if I was okay and kept kissing me. When the pain subsided I told him and he started moving. First slow, then faster. It was a weird but also pleasant feeling. 

He asked me how my first cock feels and if I liked it. I didn’t answer him at first and he pulled out. He asked me if I liked it or if I wanted to stop. I told him i liked it. And he asked me if I was sure. I told him I did. He asked me “so you want me to fuck you?”. “Yes, I want you to fuck me.” “You sure?” “Yes. Please fuck me.”
 
He went feral and pushed all the way in in one go and after that he fucked me for a good 2 hours. We tried many different positions and i cummed two times. He didn’t cum. I got tired at some point and asked me if I wanted to stop cause I looked tired. I told him he hadn’t cummed yet, I felt really weird that he didn’t when he was very focused on me cumming while fucking me. So he told me to get on my knees and I did and he jerked off and told me to suck his balls and he cummed on my face and mouth and told me to shallow which I did.
Wow this was much longer than I thought. Anyway I got really nervous that night because of STI’d and I messaged him and he told me he is clean, he is in the military and keeps getting tested and that he could show me his last months test results. I went there and saw them and he was clean. Oh and he fucked me again. 

For the last 5 days I have been going to his place and we’ve been fucking. I feel really weird because 1) he is much older than me, he is my dad’s age. 2) we’ve been going full bareback and he actually cummed in me multiple times, which was hot but I can’t help but feel a little scared but I am also into it during the act and can’t say no to him, heel once when we did use a condom it broke and I just kept riding him, 3) I always thought I was a top but apparently not.
I don’t know what to do cause I really like when we meet. It is not just the sex, which is GREAT, he knows what he is doing, but he is also fun and caring and I have never felt that from anyone before. But I also understand there is an age difference which is unusual. I am going to be here for another week and don’t know what to do, somehow I always end up at his place(thankfully my friends haven’t realised anything cause they sleep till noon and I “visit museums”. The thing is He is actually from the city I am going to study at next month and he is transferring there so I don’t know how to deal with all this and he asked to take me to dinner tomorrow.",1,1738257193.0,askgaybros,0,0.67,False

My wife and I are on the hunt for some new living room furniture and would love some recommendations that fit our needs. We're working on creating a space that's cozy, functional, and works for both of us. We spend a lot of our weekends relaxing on the couch playing board games and watching movies, so it’s been our mission to find something comfortable for lounging and sleeping. 

We’re looking for a modular couch that’s no longer than 90 inches. We’ve looked at the [Ohmu Teddy](https://omhucph.com/products/teddy) and [Poufdic Teddy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1825939326/poufudic-corner-teddy-sofa-corner-teddy?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=poufidic&ref=sr_gallery-1-3&pro=1&frs=1&sts=1&content_source=3ded9cb27986961903e8e1aaa192631da06fe970%253A1825939326&search_preloaded_img=1&organic_search_click=1), but they’re a bit out of our budget. We want something similar in style and comfort that can be rearranged into a deep two-seat chaise, but also expanded into an L-shape or a 3-seat couch with an ottoman when we have guests. 

We’ve considered Lovesac for their customization options, but we’d love to hear any other suggestions!

We’re also looking for a coffee table, particularly something like a Japanese chabudai.

We’ve found we rarely use our dining table anymore, so we’re hoping for a coffee table that can serve as a spot for meals, board games, and working on a laptop. Here are a couple of options we've found:

* [Lift-top Coffee Table](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1722903998/lift-top-coffee-table-wood-coffee-table?ref=notif_psffl) – This one is close to what we’re looking for, but we’re unsure about the quality.
* [Low Desk with Floor Chair](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1774726975/low-desk-with-floor-chair-designed-for?ref=user_profile&frs=1&pro=1) – Beautiful design, but it's more expensive and lacks storage.

In today’s fast-paced world, sleep often takes a backseat to other priorities. But did you know that what you eat can significantly impact the quality of your sleep? Your diet not only influences how quickly you fall asleep but also determines how well-rested and rejuvenated you feel upon waking.

Here’s a deep dive into the relationship between diet and sleep, the causes of sleep disturbances, sleep quality linked to good eating habits, symptoms to watch out for, and actionable solutions to help you rest better.

# The Link Between Diet and Sleep

Sleep and nutrition are interconnected through a complex interplay of hormones, metabolic processes, and nutrient intake. The foods you consume can either promote restful sleep or disrupt it, depending on factors like meal timing, portion size, and the types of nutrients you prioritise.

# Key Nutritional Factors That Influence Sleep

* Tryptophan: An amino acid found in protein-rich foods that aids the production of serotonin and melatonin, hormones that regulate sleep.
* Magnesium and Potassium: Minerals that relax muscles and calm the nervous system.
* Caffeine and Sugar: Stimulants that can keep your brain alert and interfere with your ability to fall asleep.
* Meal Timing: Late-night heavy meals or snacks can disturb the body’s natural circadian rhythm.

# Common Causes of Sleep Issues Related to Diet

# 1. Overeating Before Bed

Consuming large, calorie-dense meals late at night can make digestion harder and increase the risk of acid reflux, making it difficult to fall asleep.

# 2. Excess Caffeine

Caffeine blocks adenosine, a chemical that promotes sleep. Even afternoon coffee or tea can delay sleep onset.

# 3. High-Sugar Diets

Sugary snacks or desserts spike blood sugar levels, leading to restless sleep as your body works to stabilize glucose.

# 4. Lack of Nutrients

Deficiencies in magnesium, calcium, or vitamin D can disrupt sleep patterns, as these nutrients are crucial for muscle relaxation and hormone regulation.

# 5. Alcohol Consumption

While alcohol might initially make you drowsy, it disrupts REM sleep, leaving you feeling groggy and fatigued.



# Symptoms of Diet-Related Sleep Problems

If you feel like you are not getting a good night’s rest, these are some of the symptoms to look out for.

* Difficulty Falling Asleep: May stem from caffeine or sugar consumption.
* Frequent Night Wakings: Can be caused by indigestion or a drop in blood sugar.
* Restlessness or Light Sleep: Often linked to poor nutrient intake, particularly magnesium or tryptophan.
* Morning Fatigue: Indicates disrupted REM sleep, possibly due to alcohol or a heavy late-night meal.



# Solutions: How to Align Your Diet for Better Sleep

# 1. Choose Sleep-Promoting Foods

Incorporate foods that naturally support relaxation and hormone production.

* Bananas: Rich in magnesium and potassium.
* Almonds: A source of magnesium and tryptophan. You can also choose nutrient-dense, Wild Date snacks, which are rich in dry fruit, including almonds. A small bite of the [Wild Date snack bar](https://wilddate.in/collections/snack-bars) as a dessert after meals can do the trick. Do keep ample time between your dinner and sleep time.
* Oats: Promote melatonin production.

# 2. Limit Sleep Disruptors

* Avoid caffeine after 3 PM, especially from coffee, tea, energy drinks, or chocolate.
* Cut down on sugary snacks, especially close to bedtime.
* Avoid alcohol or consume it sparingly and well before sleep.

# 3. Time Your Meals Wisely

* Dinner Timing: Finish your last meal at least 2–3 hours before bedtime to allow for digestion.
* Balanced Snacks: If you need a late-night snack, opt for light, protein-rich options like yogurt or nuts.

# 4. Stay Hydrated

Dehydration can cause nighttime leg cramps or restlessness. Drink water throughout the day but limit intake before bedtime to avoid frequent bathroom visits.

# 5. Supplement Thoughtfully

* Magnesium: Found in leafy greens, seeds, and supplements, magnesium helps relax muscles and calm the mind.
* Melatonin: A supplement for those who struggle with sleep cycles, though it’s best to consult a doctor before use.

# Sample Day of a Sleep-Friendly Diet

* Breakfast: Whole-grain toast with avocado and eggs, plus a banana.
* Lunch: Grilled salmon or tofu with quinoa and a side of spinach.
* Snack: A handful of almonds and a piece of dark chocolate (in moderation).
* Dinner: Paneer stir-fry with vegetables, served with brown rice.
* Evening Snack: A small bowl of unsweetened yogurt with honey and walnuts.

Sleep isn’t just about how long you rest; it’s about the quality of that rest. Your diet plays a pivotal role in determining whether you wake up feeling refreshed or drained. By making mindful choices about what and when you eat, you can create a ripple effect that improves not just your sleep but your overall well-being. So, as you plan your meals, remember: every bite can either support or sabotage your sleep.

Typically when I purchase beans, I will buy a few bags at a time. One to use immediately (stored in a fellow atmos canister) and the others I will freeze in airtight jars - usually to use in a couple weeks…up to two months max.

Recently, I have purchased/received so many beans that I no longer have room for them in my freezer and I am storing them in my cabinets.

My questions:
1) does freezer storage negatively impact the flavor/quality of the coffee?
2) how long will beans remain fresh if stored in the freezer vs at room temp - assuming beans are stored in airtight jars in both scenarios?

Markscan Enforcement Software (Markscan) has been taking down some of the channels with DMCA notices. It seems that they're deliberately opening multiple copyright infringement cases with YouTube (3+ per 'creator') rather than single cases as 3 cases within a 90 day period is an instant account ban from YouTube. This is an instant-ban just via the action of filing the DMCA - the account is closed even without a response from the account holder.

 

This is why Man Moth (and others) has suddenly disappeared. I don't see any of Man Moth's social medias/alt pages showing up anymore either so I'm guessing he's filed a copyright counter-notice and it's been rejected by YouTube and since he has deleted those other pages to avoid further legal involvement (theory). The only sites I can find left are his ""buy me a coffee"" link (https://buymeacoffee.com/manmoth) and merch site (https://www.man-moth.com/).

 

It's odd though as looking at Markscan's client list none of those seem to be any IP holders of any media to do with the radio shows except for Sony. Is it the songs that are causing the copyright claims? I thought Sony Music Entertainment dealt with audio IP's not Sony Picture Networks.

 

None of the channels that post exclusively the podcasts seem to have been taken down - again is this to do with the music?

 

Is this a case of free-agent copyright striking/copyright trolling or is there an entity deliberately pursuing taking this media down via Markscan?",5,1738256781.0,rickygervais,16,0.86,False

1idrprv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1idrprv,[Homemade] I Drank a $27 Cup of Speciality Coffee,"**The Story**

My wife and I recently visited Japan on our way to a destination wedding. As a budding coffee enthusiast, I had one Tokyo café high on my list—Glitch Coffee, a well-known specialty coffee roaster. Unfortunately, when we arrived, we were met with a long line. After waiting for about five minutes, it was clear we’d be standing there for the better part of an hour. With limited time in Tokyo, we decided to move on to our next planned stop. While I was disappointed, it didn’t take away from an incredible day in a city unlike any other I’ve experienced as a Westerner.

Due to our itinerary, we couldn’t fit in another visit to Glitch. A few days later, I flew out to meet up with the other groomsmen for the bachelor party in another country, while my wife stayed behind to join the bridesmaids in Japan for their bachelorette party. She spent an extra day in Tokyo before heading to Osaka with the group.

Then, to my surprise, the very next day I got a notification that our shared credit card had been used at Glitch!

My wonderful, loving wife had made the trip back, braved the line, and not only tried some of their coffee but also picked up two jars to bring home for me. One of them is what I brewed today.

 

**The Coffee**

This particular coffee, grown in Nicaragua, is of the Geisha variety, known for its tea-like profile. Geisha is a rare coffee that produces significantly lower yields compared to more common varieties. This specific batch was grown at Los Alpes Farm in the Nueva Segovia region of Nicaragua and even won the 2023 Cup of Excellence for the country.

Unlike most modern coffee, which is washed-processed, this one was naturally processed, meaning the beans were dried inside the coffee cherry rather than being de-pulped from the cherry before drying. Neither process is inherently better, but natural processing typically results in fruitier flavors, whereas washed beans highlight more of the coffee’s inherent characteristics.

Glitch roasted these beans to a light roast, with jasmine tea, grape, and floral as their tasting notes. And yes, my dear wife spent $53.87 for just 50g of these beans—which comes out to $26.94 per the 25g used in the cup I brewed.

 

**The Brew**

I brewed this coffee using a 1:16 ratio of beans to water (25g to 400g) with my OXO 8-cup coffee maker. As it was brewing, I was immediately hit with a sweet, tea-like aroma.

After letting it cool slightly, I took my first sip and was blown away. The jasmine tea notes were immediately present, followed by a slight tartness of grape in the middle, and ending with a floral aftertaste. Wow. I was genuinely impressed that every single note from the roaster’s tasting description was clearly distinguishable.

While I normally drink my coffee black, I have no doubt that even someone who typically adds cream and sugar would enjoy this one straight. It truly tasted like no other coffee I’ve had before.

 

**Was It Worth It?**

$27 for one cup? Maybe? If you factor in the unique experience and the sentimental value of my wife’s effort, then absolutely. But based on price alone? No.

Specialty coffee is a game of diminishing returns, and I’ll admit this crossed the point where you’re paying exponentially more for marginal improvements. In fact, the other jar my wife brought back was another Geisha variety, but from Colombia, which cost $7.56 per 25g—and I actually liked that one more. It had notes of grapefruit and ginger that resonated better with my palate.

Both were amazing, but in hindsight, there was no real need to splurge on ultra-expensive beans. That said, I loved the experience, and for that, I have no regrets.

If you’re ever in Tokyo, I highly recommend checking out Glitch Coffee. While pricey, they are true masters of their craft.

I have upgraded through several versions of Wi-Fi and never had an issue with backwards compatibility with older devices/clients.  From what I'm reading Wi-Fi 7 is backwards compatible with previous versions of Wi-Fi.  I also read though that due to the enhanced security of it Wi-Fi 5 devices and up work but Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n I believe) do not work.  Is this true?  It seems conflicting.

My main devices such as laptops, smartphones, streaming boxes, etc. all are either Wi-Fi 5 and up.  When going through my devices I saw a few device I have are just 802.11n.  These include a Vizio Smart TV, an Ecobee 3 Lite Smart Thermostat, a HomePod mini, Govee Christmas Lights, Govee Strip Lights, Nanoleaf Shapes, an Atomi Smart Coffee Maker which I have not found the specs but believe it may be 802.11n, Google Nest Protect Smoke/Co Alarms, Twinkly Lights that don't show in specs but may be 802.11n, plus a couple Meross smart lights that I suspect are 802.11n.  Also an Epson Wi-Fi Printer.  

I have a lot of smart devices but fortunately the others are mostly either connected via hubs directed to my switch with Ethernet cables or via Thread protocol which is what I'm trying to go towards.

Hi everyone,

My mother in law is now in a nursing home and wants to display this photo of her and her best friend, BUT, it was stuck to the glass frame which got broken in the move. So, I'm hoping someone way more talented than I am can retouch it to remove the lines from the glass, the flare from my camera on the upper left, and any distorted spots so I can reprint and give to her to display.

Happy to buy you coffee, Monster or whatever else in exchange!

1idrmmj,https://i.redd.it/xwly04jxw5ge1.jpeg,My experience going from swasticar to Air Pure,"I wasn’t sure if I was going to like the Lucid Air Pure coming from a model Y but my god the car is so much quieter and rides better.  It actually feels like a luxury car. I’m 6’ 4” and I fit in the back seat with room to spare. 

I have some gripes about the experience being in the car.  I’m tall so it can be difficult to see the speedometer because the steering wheel is in the way but it’s not critical.  I wish the driving mode I prefer, swift, would stay registered with my profile instead of me having to pick it every time I start the car.  The mobile key can be hit or miss. A few times I’ve had to open the app and wake up the car just to unlock the doors.  This feels like a software fix.  I think these things are very minor. 

On the plus side, my buying experience has been amazing.  Saw the car in studio and began talking  with associates.  I was interested in the Gravity, and still am, but not the Grand Touring model.  Everyone has been super responsive with texts and emails.  I forgot what basic customer service is like because Tesla had none!  The car I wanted (and got), a quantum grey stealth package, was at another studio and they were even helpful to get the car closer. Excellent service all around. 

I just got this car yesterday, and already had to bring it back to be serviced the very next day.  That is a sucky feeling.  The door handle broke. The door stayed locked but you couldn’t open it from the outside.  Lesson learned, don’t accidentally press down on the door handle. I feel like this handle shouldn’t be this fragile.  I’m going to chalk it up to minor bad luck. 

The service center I’m at is super nice and helpful. I arrived before they opened and they ushered me in and directed me to the comfy studio with coffee.  I’ve had no less than three people check on me and offer me things. Wow, basic hospitality too. 

Despite having to bring the car back I still feel like this is the best car and best driving experience you can have for a luxury electric sedan.

I work with my coworker who got hired after me and who always works morning. Well I recently learned that they have been sending rants to the scheduling manager and pushing to meet with the owner all because they dislike working with me. 

Background: this coworker has had multiple spats with other coworkers. The last person they worked with regularly was their “friend” but really the coworker just used them. This person has regularly called out at 4 and 5 am for their open shift causing strain on the owner and the other opener. 

I have worked here for a year or more, I have 4 years in coffee, and I love what I do. During my shifts, I make sure to open properly, make syrups (we make our own in house), restock, clean, and any other necessary things. 

My coworker chooses to make drinks and then sit. She’ll regularly go to the bathroom without notice for 5-7 minutes leaving me to manage customers, drinks, and food. When I happen to be sitting, I may have my iPad open, or scrolling my phone. My coworker will have one drink to make and one customer and will yell at me to “come take their order”. 

I am fine to help where I can but when I am able to manage a line of 3 people, 3 breakfast sandwiches, and drinks it seems a bit annoying that she can’t handle a third of that. 

I found out two days ago she ranted to the scheduling manager saying “I don’t want to be scheduled with her. I’ll work the other locations. Or I’ll quit. She doesn’t listen, she doesn’t talk. She ignores me.” This is very different from what my owner told me later. As he told me she stated that I ignore customers and am always on my iPad. 

Her complaints are interpersonal and could have been solved with chatting with me. Also I don’t talk to her because she typically has a book or during conversation  she makes everything about herself. I am there to work. Not be besties. 

Talking to the owner I explained what I manage to do. How my coworker is often in the bathroom. And they seemed to recognize that this coworker is more of a problem than I am. ",15,1738256416.0,barista,4,0.89,False

Palate : drinks hot for 117.2 proof. spiced fruits (cherries, figs, maybe some peach) deep oak, earthiness, hints of coffee

1idrgo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1idrgo6/aitah_for_going_nc_with_my_mom/,AITAH For going NC with my mom?,"Hi Reddit, I really don’t know how to handle this situation so any advice would be greatly appreciated.
So all of this started when I was a kid, my parents got divorced when I was 3yo and I stayed with my mom. Then my mother started telling me that my dad wouldn’t pay child support. That he doesn’t care if I eat or even live, mind I was 4yo. She started a lawsuit against him for child support. I’ve been taken out of school for a couple of hours many time to testify against my father, but at the same time my mom was very aggressive towards me. She used to hit me with belts, flip flops, her own hands, a bath brush, you name it. She used phrases like “you are no more than a problem in my life” or the classic phrases an abusive parent use with their kids. Not always she had a reason to hit me, sometimes could be my low grades but some others she was just pissed bc she has a rough day. I one of my visits to my dad at his house, I took a shower and while I was getting dressed, he got into the room thinking I was already dressed up. He saw my body full of bruises and scratches. He instantly told me to put on my underwear and then he will take a better look to those wounds. He was clearly mad at my mom and he cried (he always loved me, the most “hurtful” thing he did at me was raising his voice once bc I got to go to summer school, but that’s it) he took me to a doctor and started a lawsuit against my mom for child abuse. And there was me, testifying against each other every now and then, my father always telling me to tell the truth and my mother manipulating me saying If I don’t say that her hitting me is not truth, I would be taken with my dad and I wouldn’t be able to see again my family (for her side, grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins, etc…) which I didn’t want. By this time I was 8yo. My brother was born and by this time my mom started telling my dad that If he doesn’t pay, she wouldn’t let me see him. When she had any appointment or needed to see the jury I told her to told my dad I miss him, if he can call me or anything. Apparently she did, but he never wanted to call, she also told me my aunts, cousins, grandmother, every person in my father’s side hated me bc they think I don’t need the money, that my father doesn’t deserve to go to jail for just not paying child support and I was responsible for that (a 9yo girl). Time passed and when I was 15yo I called my father to ask about my school supplies, he got mad at me telling me my mother was behind me forcing me to ask for money, and my stepmom told me my dad was not my wallet. (I want to clarify, my stepmom was NEVER a bad person or the “Cinderella” type, she is the most lovely and pure person you could ever know, she is a fair person with so much understanding and empathy) so my mom took the opportunity and told me “you know what, we don’t need him, I’m gonna buy you everything as always”. He went NC with me and I wouldn’t stop crying for 2 years, I felt manipulated, gaslighted, not loved, idk I was really lost. I tried to un alive myself not only once, I went to the point I sat on the edge of a building testing myself if I was brave enough to jump. Spoiler alert, I wasn’t. So years later I am married with a great man, I love him more than anything but my mom wasn’t having it. She prohibited me living with him during my pregnancy, she told my husband she will “train” me to be a good wife and being pregnant she made me mop the floor, clean the house, the bathrooms, make breakfast, wash all the dishes… Her excuse was always “you are pregnant, not sick”. Even though I was not comfortable, I accepted it bc I always lived with fear of her and in a (stupid) way, I thought it was the correct thing to do. My husband saw all of this and the same day texted me saying “get your stuff ready, tomorrow I’ll go for you with bags” and he did, she was beyond surprised and mad at him, so she started telling him I was extremely lazy, that I don’t clean, wash, pick up my stuff, fold my clothes, nothing, so he was taking with him a burden. He answered “that’s my problem, I never looked for a maid, but for a wife” when she realized he won’t let me be there a single day more, she started crying telling me to at least hug her bc she would miss me. I hug her but it felt empty for both of us. Living with my husband was difficult at the beginning bc I was used to a different lifestyle, they shared the table, eating all together, we didn’t. They say I love you many times a day, we were lucky If we say that once a month. It was overwhelming for me when he was insisting on me merging with his family. I got some problems with them bc of my resting bitch face, which I don’t do on purpose, so explain how difficult it was for me seeing all of this love, unity and loyalty. They understood and helped me giving me my time. My BIL asked me for my father (he is a psychologist) and recommended me to get in contact with him bc of more time passes I will regret not clarifying things. So I did. A year ago I texted my cousin by my fathers side and told her I wanted to talk to my dad. She told me not to talk to her If what I wanted was money. I was shocked, I told her the least I care about is money which she responded telling me that I was moving documents and the lawyers to claim more and more money to my dad and the was so ill that he almost didn’t make it. I cried a lot. The only person who can do that was my mom, I told her to stop since he is hospitalized and with a deadly illness. She stopped for a few months, months when I convinced my cousin I didn’t wanted money, but to recover my relationship with my dad. She trusted me until my mother again asked for more money which my cousin told me it was a mistake trusting me, I asked why and when she told me about the request, I told her very firmly “Gaby (fake name), I HAVE A NEW BORN, I need to take care of my baby and my new family. I have my own money, the one doing that is my mother” and I sent her screenshots where I told my mother to stop, when I contacted a lawyer to ask him how I can finish this, etc. She believed me and gave me my stepmom’s phone number. I spoke with her and as I thought all of them used to think I was trying to contact for money. I told them the truth. I was never after the money and the one getting and spending the money was my mother, she forced me into giving her every single penny he used to pay. We discovered many things. When she used to tell me everyone hated me (I was 5 or 6yo) she was not telling them I wanted contact, she told my dad she won’t stop until taking all from him and swing him in jail, then she would come home and tell me she hug my dad and ask very kindly to call me by he declined. He showed me proof that he payed my school, my supplies, he told me he payed child support to her but he didn’t saved the receipts bc he never imagined she would be that mean. She told them that I didn’t want to see them bc they were poor ignorant people who don’t mean anything to me (complete bullshit) we clarify everything and now more things are coming up. Now I have a very good relationship with them, but I stopped talking to my mother, I didn’t confronted her, I just desapeared from her life. She texted me in the beginning even sent me a 25 minute audio trying to manipulate me saying I was the one betraying her, I am ungrateful and she always took good care of me, she cried and asked me to talk to her and ask her how many time she suffered alone bc of my dad. Many things I won’t put bc this is long enough. Now I want to be honest, I miss her but I think I only miss the wish of having a mother, of being able to say “hey mom, let’s go eat something, my treat” or “hi mom, let meet and drink some coffee” idk. I don’t k ow If it is the manipulated child inside me talking or what, but I really want a mom. I don’t want HER, I would never forgive what she did to my dad, all the lies, manipulation, gaslighting, how she was mean and racist with my husband (we are not white, but she behaves like a white rich lady), how she treated me since I was a little kid and how she victimizes her now saying I betrayed and abandoned her. My stepfather tells me she will always be my mother and one way or another I will speak with her one day, so it would be better for me to speak with her now. My brother is very neutral, he just don’t want to get involved. I feel if I speak with her (which I don’t want to) would be a betrayal to my husband who protected me so much, my dad and my in laws who supported me. As I mentioned, I don’t need HER, I just feel sad and depressed bc I don’t have a mom, even if I try to, she knows how to manipulate me and I know If I get back to her, I will believe her and fall into her lies. I have a very weak heart and mind. I want to keep NC with her, but I don’t know what to do, please help.",2,1738256054.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

(Recommendations Needed),"TL;DR: Looking for furniture recommendations for ADHD and ASD needs, including a modular couch under 90"" and a coffee table like a Japanese chabudai for floor sitting.

Hey everyone,

My wife (40F) and I (36M) are trying to create a comfortable and supportive space that accommodates both of our needs. I’ve had ADHD since I was 11, but it’s only been in the last couple of years that I’ve truly understood what that means. My wife, on the other hand, has struggled with sleep and eating for years and was recently diagnosed with ASD after years of managing anxiety and CPTSD.

Sleep has always been a challenge for her, and she’s always felt more comfortable on the couch. Growing up, she would experience night terrors in her bed, and after losing her mom at age 10, she spent a lot of time on the couch as a comfort and safe space. She’s also very sensitive to textures when sleeping—she loves knitted blankets and certain soft materials.

On weekends, we spend a lot of time on the couch watching movies and wrestling PPVs, often falling asleep there. So we’re looking for a new modular couch, preferably no longer than 90 inches. We’ve checked out the [Ohmu Teddy](https://omhucph.com/products/teddy) and the [Poufdic Teddy](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://www.etsy.com/listing/1825939326/poufudic-corner-teddy-sofa-corner-teddy%C2%A0ga_order=most_relevant%26ga_search_type=all%26ga_view_type=gallery%26ga_search_query=poufidic%26ref=sr_gallery-1-3%26pro=1%26frs=1%26sts=1%26content_source=3ded9cb27986961903e8e1aaa192631da06fe970%253A1825939326%26search_preloaded_img=1%26organic_search_click=1) because of the texture, fun colors, and modern style, but the price is a bit much. 

We want something with personality and flexibility—a couch that can be rearranged into a deep two-seat chaise for us but can also be expanded into an L-shape or 3-seat couch with an ottoman when we have guests.

We also looked at Lovesac, which has great customization and storage, but we’re hoping for more options. Any recommendations based on your experience would be super helpful!

Another thing we’re looking for is a coffee table, specifically something like a Japanese chabudai. 

We barely use our dining room table anymore because my wife has a lot of food anxiety, and eating dinner triggers her stress. Recently, she’s been floor-sitting to eat, and it has helped her experience less choking and chest pain. We found a couple of coffee tables that might work:

* [Lift-top coffee table](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1722903998/lift-top-coffee-table-wood-coffee-table?ref=notif_psffl) – This one’s similar to what we want, but I’m unsure about the quality.
* [Low desk with floor chair](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1774726975/low-desk-with-floor-chair-designed-for?ref=user_profile&frs=1&pro=1) – It looks great, but it’s pricier and doesn’t have storage.

Don’t crucify me for the next part: I saw a bag of coffee at tj maxx and bought it. The next day I bought an aeropress because it just seems like the best option for me. I’m on my third day of making coffee and I have to admit, it is in fact the best tasting coffee I’ve ever had, *however* there is still some very mild bitterness to it, which I don’t mind but the reviews for the aeropress overwhelmingly stated no bitterness. So here are my silly questions, 

**is coffee always at least a little bitter?**

**if not, what coffee is the least better?**

**does freshly grinding coffee reduce bitterness?**

**what bean/roast are the least bitter?**

**if fresh grinding is a huge factor in bitterness, what machine should I buy? I’m currently looking at 2: the breville smart grinder pro is my top choice, and the baratza virtuoso as my second choice. But $200-$250 is A LOT. The first one seems quieter and has more settings. My husband would also use it because he likes cold brew and lattes, but I’d also need a milk frother or steamer and so I’m waiting to purchase because I know nothing**

I already know you will all suggest freshly grinding lol, but I would like to know more personal experiences, or a more technical answer than “you NEED to grind your coffee fresh”

(Recommendations Needed),"TL;DR: Looking for furniture recommendations for ADHD and ASD needs, including a modular couch under 90"" and a coffee table like a Japanese chabudai for floor sitting.

Hey everyone,

My wife (40F) and I (36M) are trying to create a comfortable and supportive space that accommodates both of our needs. I’ve had ADHD since I was 11, but it’s only been in the last couple of years that I’ve truly understood what that means. My wife, on the other hand, has struggled with sleep and eating for years and was recently diagnosed with ASD after years of managing anxiety and CPTSD.

Sleep has always been a challenge for her, and she’s always felt more comfortable on the couch. Growing up, she would experience night terrors in her bed, and after losing her mom at age 10, she spent a lot of time on the couch as a comfort and safe space. She’s also very sensitive to textures when sleeping—she loves knitted blankets and certain soft materials.

On weekends, we spend a lot of time on the couch watching movies and wrestling PPVs, often falling asleep there. So we’re looking for a new modular couch, preferably no longer than 90 inches. We’ve checked out the [Ohmu Teddy](https://omhucph.com/products/teddy) and the [Poufdic Teddy](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://www.etsy.com/listing/1825939326/poufudic-corner-teddy-sofa-corner-teddy%C2%A0ga_order=most_relevant%26ga_search_type=all%26ga_view_type=gallery%26ga_search_query=poufidic%26ref=sr_gallery-1-3%26pro=1%26frs=1%26sts=1%26content_source=3ded9cb27986961903e8e1aaa192631da06fe970%253A1825939326%26search_preloaded_img=1%26organic_search_click=1) because of the texture, fun colors, and modern style, but the price is a bit much. 

We want something with personality and flexibility—a couch that can be rearranged into a deep two-seat chaise for us but can also be expanded into an L-shape or 3-seat couch with an ottoman when we have guests.

We also looked at Lovesac, which has great customization and storage, but we’re hoping for more options. Any recommendations based on your experience would be super helpful!

Another thing we’re looking for is a coffee table, specifically something like a Japanese chabudai. 

We barely use our dining room table anymore because my wife has a lot of food anxiety, and eating dinner triggers her stress. Recently, she’s been floor-sitting to eat, and it has helped her experience less choking and chest pain. We found a couple of coffee tables that might work:

* [Lift-top coffee table](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1722903998/lift-top-coffee-table-wood-coffee-table?ref=notif_psffl) – This one’s similar to what we want, but I’m unsure about the quality.
* [Low desk with floor chair](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1774726975/low-desk-with-floor-chair-designed-for?ref=user_profile&frs=1&pro=1) – It looks great, but it’s pricier and doesn’t have storage.

Any recommendations from others with similar sensory sensitivities or experiences with creating supportive home environments would be greatly appreciated! We’d love to hear how you’ve adapted your spaces.",1,1738255655.0,autism,1,1.0,False

1idr7x9,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1idr7x9/my_feelings_towards_you/,My Feelings Towards You,"Hey there,

  
Okay, so, I’m just going to dive right in because if I don’t, I’ll probably chicken out and this will never see the light of day. I’m Julia, and I’m 19, and I have a huge crush on you. Yeah, I said it. It’s out there now, and I’m kind of freaking out because what if you read this and think I’m totally weird? 

  
I’ve been wanting to tell you for, like, forever, but every time I try to talk to you, my brain decides to take a vacation to Mars or something. You make me so nervous, and I swear, I forget how to even string words together. Like, remember that time in the library when I saw you, and all I managed to say was ""hi"" in this squeaky voice? I wanted to ask you about the book you were reading because it looked so cool, but nope, my brain was like, ""Nope, we're shutting down.""

  
I guess what I’m trying to say is, I think you’re amazing. You have this laugh that kind of makes the world feel a bit less heavy, and your passion for whatever you’re into at the moment is just... inspiring. I love how you don’t care if people think you’re geeky for loving sci-fi or whatever; it’s just you, and that’s pretty awesome.

  
And okay, confession time - I’ve been going to the coffee shop near campus more often because I know you work there sometimes. I sit there, pretending to study, but really, I’m just trying to summon the courage to talk to you. I swear, I’ve probably read the same paragraph in my textbook like ten times without even absorbing a word because I was too busy trying to catch your eye or come up with something clever to say.

  
I’m not usually this awkward; I promise I can be pretty cool when I’m not totally crushing on someone. I mean, I love music - I play the guitar, not that I’m good or anything, but I love it. And I’m into photography; I capture moments, the kind that make you feel something deep inside. I’d love to show you some of my photos one day, or maybe we could go take some together if that’s not too far.

  
So, I guess what I’m asking, in my very roundabout, super awkward way, is if maybe you’d like to hang out sometime?. We could go for a walk, or grab a coffee (not at your work, unless you want to), or just chill and talk about anything. I’d really like to get to know you better, outside of my head where I’ve probably built you up into this perfect person (though, you might just be perfect, who knows?).

  
If this is too much, I totally get it. I mean, I’ll probably need to hide under my bed for a week if you say no, but I’ll survive. But if you feel like maybe, just maybe, you’d like to see what this could be, I’d be over the moon.

  
Thanks for reading this, even if it’s a bit all over the place. Here’s hoping I didn’t scare you off.

Lots of anxiety","After moving to a new city, I met a few girls last year that I clicked with. We did a lot of regular meals together and hangouts.. after about 8 months of this, I started to feel like the lifestyle was too much for me. I WFH and make my own schedule, and I was slacking at work. It was harming my finances.

They are freelancers so they sometimes go long stretches with out working. It was fun at first, but my life was being messed up from going out to eat 2x/week + coffee up to 4 days a week.

My life got busier this fall, and so I stopped seeing them as much. I made sure to let them know this was going to be the case beforehand. Then both of them got busier.. so now it's been maybe 3 or 4 months since we regularly hung out. I noticed myself putting more effort into other relationships in terms of communication, but it didn't bother me that much.

Let's call these friends Chelsea, and Sarah. My weird feelings started when Sarah was rude to 2 friends of mine, and I didn't like it, but didn't tell her.

All three of our lives went a little haywire in recent months. Chelsea has stopped getting work and has gone into major debt. She is crying almost daily, but she doesn't overly vent all over me or something. I just know shes going through a really hard time. Sarah decided to do something with work that caused her emotional harm. It was planned on her part, required going across the world, and got her a lot of recognition, but came at a huge cost emotionally. 

Chelsea has been pushing me to be there for Sarah since she returned from her trip, but I am only able to offer what I can, and I was very busy at the time and I skipped out on a couple of hang outs. Sarah was also a little rude to me during her first initial hang out after returning from her trip and so I wasn't keen on seeing her again soon.

Sarah also doesn't share her struggles without being asked. I have tried to be present for her. but I again got angry because I shared wanting to be pregnant, and both friends were rude to me (via text). This was early December, so I decided to pull back on the relationships and just focus on other things.. that's when some real trauma happened in my life \[TW domestic violence\]. My brother was arrested for domestic violence- >!attacking his home/wife with a mini sledge hammer (he and his wife were extremely important people to me. The fall out of this has been absolutely devastating for me.!< If that wasn't enough, 24hrs later my fiancé's brother decided it was time to call me up and let me know all the ways in which he hated me. It was an abusive, out of the blue phone call that utterly rocked me and my fiancé to the point of almost canceling our wedding. The fallout of that has also been devestating. Then my grandpa died. This was all in the span of a week.

I then finally saw Chelsea again for a coffee date this week, and she told me that Sarah thinks I dont want to be her friend anymore and that I am mad at her because I am being so distant. Hearing that made my stomach have instant and debilitating cramps. I thought I had done a good enough job at expressing that I was going through some serious family stuff (told them briefly about all 3 incidents). But it's true that I never told her I was upset that she was rude to another friend, and upset that she was rude about wanting to be pregnant.

Now I feel just so frustrated because I am worried that it is true. Do I want to keep being friends with Sarah? I dont want to split up our little trio. I dont know how to bring up my anger with either of my friends about the pregnancy thing.. and I dont know if it's even appropriate. My fiance thinks that they dump on me emotionally and dont give anything in return.. I dont really know what to do. They've become my core friend group since moving to my new city, but I am just so tired of carrying these things.

Side note, I dont drink, but they will often stay out after I leave until 4-6am drinking. Sarah chain smokes, and we have to sit outside in the cold every time we go out to eat.. I just really dont like this because my coats end up smelling like smoke and I can't exactly wash them. My fiance says they are kind of degenerates :/ but they have very fancy freelancing gigs, and so I am enamored by that aspect of their lives..

I realized 10ish years ago that Chick Fil a had good coffee.... great coffee actually. I prefered it over local spots, Starbucks, homemade, etc, and if I'm being honest, it carried a large portion of the reason that I would go there for breakfast. The food was great, but the coffee was a real treat. For as long as I went there, they would add the cream to the coffee (sometimes I would have to ask), which just seems like the obvious thing to do- I'm driving a vehicle, they're preparing the food, they're pouring the coffee... might as well throw the creamer in there before pouring the coffee right? Well they stopped doing that for some reason. At first they stopped on their own but would do it if I asked them to at the drive thru window. Then they told me they just wouldn't do it. Oh well, I get they're busy (not sure how much time it takes to pour in a single creamer but whatever...), so it was a minor inconvenience I dealt with (having to pull over and stir it in before getting back on the road).

Fast forward to sometime around 2020-2021 and they inexplicitly decided to stop selling the large cup of coffee. For any avid coffee drinkers out there, this was quite the faux pas, and the reasons given were... unconvincing. I read online it had to do with consolodating the menu, cut costs, etc etc.... So I would give them a pass if they were struggling or losing market share but... They're literally the highest grossing restaurant in the United States behind McDonalds. 

I recently went to a location and checked my bag before leaving and... no coffee stirrer. No big deal, people forget things, so I asked the guy at the window for one. He said ""sorry sir, we don't have stirrers, I can get you a spoon or straw?"". Not in the mood to debate, I said it was fine, I would use a spoon I had at my office. He was maybe 17 years old if I'm being generous and figured he didn't know where they were at, maybe they were out etc. No big deal.

Two more times I go by there and order coffee and both times they say they don't have stirrers so now I feel like I'm going crazy. They had stirrers, they had the great wood ones that didn't make you feel like you were mixing melting plastic cancer in your coffee, then they had the ones that stuck in the opening to prevent your coffee from spilling, and they were great! Alas, someone else confirmed that they just don't have them anymore.

Now they will only sell you one size cup, they won't pour the creamer in there, and now they have actually gotten rid of the tool to stir the cream yourself. It would be one thing if they were following trends in the restaurant world but they're literally the only restaurant phasing out this kind of stuff. Does anyone have any insight? What gives?",30,1738255125.0,ChickFilA,25,0.85,False

The office buzzed with the familiar chaos of deadline pressure, endless notifications, and the constant hum of fluorescent lights. It was just another Tuesday afternoon – or was it?

That's when she noticed the small, elegant pod on her colleague's desk. ""What's that?"" she asked, intrigued by its minimalist design and natural tones.

""This?"" Lisa smiled, reaching for the pod. ""This is my daily moment of zen. Want to share?""

https://preview.redd.it/fq75f4u4s5ge1.png?width=2025&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee1e3c88c8972152943e585b8f81919e4220566f

As Lisa opened the 11 Essentiel pod, a subtle but calming aroma filled the air. Inside, carefully arranged organic nuts and seeds glistened alongside natural botanicals. ""It's a sharing pod,"" Lisa explained, ""designed for moments exactly like this.""

The ritual was simple but transformative. They paused their work, shared the perfectly portioned snack, and for a few precious minutes, the office chaos seemed to melt away. The carefully selected ingredients – each chosen for both their nutritional value and calming properties – worked in perfect harmony.

""It's not just about the snack,"" Lisa said, noting Sarah's relaxed shoulders and calmer demeanor. ""It's about taking a moment to reset, to connect, to share a brief escape from our busy days.""

That afternoon marked the beginning of a new ritual in their office. What started as a simple shared moment between two colleagues grew into something more meaningful. The 11 Essentiel pod became a symbol of mindful breaks, of connection in a disconnected world, of finding peace in the midst of chaos.

Soon, other colleagues noticed the change. The 3 PM slump, once dominated by coffee runs and stress-eating, transformed into mindful moments of sharing and rejuvenation. The pods became a natural conversation starter, a way to build bridges between departments, and most importantly, a daily reminder to pause and breathe.

In a world where wellness often feels like another item on our endless to-do lists, 11 Essentiel offers something different: a simple, shareable moment of tranquility. It's not about complex routines or time-consuming practices. It's about finding small moments of peace and sharing them with others.

As Sarah now keeps a small collection of pods in her desk drawer, she often thinks back to that first shared moment. ""It's amazing how something so simple can change your entire day,"" she reflects, reaching for a pod to share with her team.

Razorfist says “you claim Michael Jackson took you to Euro Disney on a 'honeymoon' in 1988... when Euro Disney wasn't even opened until 1992

But James never said Eurodisney. Not once - It’s never mentioned. It’s Disney World which was open in 1988. Below is the statement from his lawsuit.

“22. In or about 1988, DECEDENT invited Plaintiff to meet him in Pensacola, Florida, where DECEDENT and his band were rehearsing. DECEDENT and MJJ PRODUCTIONS and/or MJJ VENTURES arranged for Plaintiff and his parents to travel to Florida, and stay in one of the houses that DECEDENT and MJJ PRODUCTIONS and/or MJJ VENTURES had rented there. Plaintiff stayed with DECEDENT in one house, and Plaintiffs parents stayed in one of the other houses. This was the first time that Plaintiff stayed with DECEDENT on a trip. DECEDENT also took Plaintiff and his parents for a side visit to Disney World”

Razorfist says “The 1993 case was a successful extortion attempt.”

This has been disproven and argued about for years but in a nutshell

Jackson’s former attorney agreed with Evan and Barry Rothman that the talks were legal negotiations, not an attempt to extort money.

“…. no charges of extortion were brought against Chandler, citing Jackson's lawyers' failure to file for extortion in a timely manner and Jackson's willingness to negotiate with Chandler for several weeks, which Montagna then goes on to explain that settlements were encouraged as it is what the law favored. Montagna also said the discussions between Jackson's representatives and Barry K. Rothman, Chandler's attorney at that time, appeared to be attempts to settle a possible civil case, not efforts to extort money.

""We’ve declined to file today criminal charges of attempted extortion. The evidence does not show that any crime has been committed.""

Razorfist says: The police only found one item which could be vaguely construed as pedophilic.

This isn’t true.

29 magazines the police found contained images of naked boys. These magazines are still currently in demand and collected by pedophiles because they are a safe, legal source of images of naked children. According to Bill Dworin, a 34-year veteran of the LAPD who has investigated more than 4,000 sexual exploitation cases,

“Pedophiles will frequently have this material available because they can obtain it legally, it’s not illegal to possess”.

This is what they found.

Evidence Item #505. Books with pictures of nude children.

Three books, containing ‘photographs of nude and partially clothed children’. The investigator noted that the books contained images of partially clothed or naked children, as well as images of nude adults with children’s faces morphed on top. This technique may be used to sexualize and lower the inhibitions of a victim, according to the report.

Evidence Item #303. Three books containing nude photographs, including those of teenagers and pre-teenagers.

Naked and semi-clothed images of women ‘in sexually explicit poses,’ as well as naked men as filmed by a gay photographer. One book contained semi-clothed or fully-nude teenagers or pre-teenagers, according to the report.

Evidence Item #509. Book with pictures of nude children.

The hard cover book is titled Cronos, by author Pere Formigeura, contains images of nude children of both sexes, as well as adults.

Book: ‘Boys Will be Boys,’ contains full frontal nudity of boys under the age of 14; personally inscribed by Michael Jackson.

Book: ‘In Search of Young Beauty,’ containing pictures of children, boys and girls, some nude.

Book: ‘The Boy, a Photographic Essay,’ containing images of boys, some nude.

Photograph: Noted in the document as ‘believed to be Jonathan Spence; fully nude.’

Photograph: young boy holding an umbrella, with bikini bottoms partially pulled down.

Evidence Item #364: ‘The Chop Suey Club’ = Photo book, young adult male models, some nude.

Evidence Item #365: Pornographic books, including images of naked children.

‘Robert Maxwell Photographs,’ various images, including those of children.

Evidence Item #366: Several books, containing images of nude men and children.

Nude images of a nude male couple, another contained nude images of men from the 1800s. Photos of teenage males nude, images of adults with childrens’ faces morphed on top, some nude photos of children.

4 ‘Barely Legal’ DVDs.

Powerbook which contained 10 searches for ""teenage sex"" and 21 graphic nude images from ""teen sex"" internet site.

Razorfist says “The prosecution never said Michael sleeps in the same bed as young boys, they said he sleeps in the same room as young boys.”

The prosecution always said that MJ slept in the same bed with young boys. Even witnesses for the defense...

MJ admitted himself to “sleeping in a bed with many children"".

On the stand Macaulay Culkin confirmed he shared a bed with MJ.

In 1993, Wade Robson and Brett Barnes, said they had also slept in the same bed (on different occasions) with MJ.

MJ's house manager - Jesus Salas, testified that boys often slept in MJ’s bed.

Joy Robson at the 2005 trial said in 1993 Jackson had chosen Jordan to stay in his Neverland bedroom, which left Wade excluded.

Brett’s sister Karlee confirmed that her brother shared MJ’s bed every single night during a particular period as well as all the times they stayed at Neverland when Jackson was there. It amounted to 465+ nights.

Bob Jones - MJ’s manager of 17 years said Jordy and MJ shared a bed for 30 consecutive nights.

in 2005 (before wades allegations) Joy Robson gave a court testimony admitting under oath that she delivered Wade late at night directly to MJ's room. —-

Razorfist says: The Chandlers, acting on advice from their lawyer Larry Feldman, deliberately waited to level charges for several months until Michael Jackson had begun his tour for the Dangerous album”

The Dangerous tour commenced on June 27th, 1992, 14 months before the Chandlers accused Jackson of molestation.

https://reddit.com/link/1idqz9z/video/cq2c45tgr5ge1/player

Razorfist says: “Michael Jackson would have had to cancel the second leg of the Dangerous tour to fight the charges in court, that’s part of why he settled.”

Michael Jackson commenced the third leg of the Dangerous tour on August 24th, 1993 and canceled the remaining few concerts on November the 14th, 1993, prior to settling with the Chandlers in January 1994.

I really liked going out to grab a coffee with a coworker and talking about random things, sometimes getting deeper, and forming friendships. There was something really special about having some good chats and support throughout the work day, even if I had other relationships/friendships in my life.

I've since moved jobs and while there are many improvements, I haven't found the same level of friendships, and the job can be quite isolating. It would be lovely to make a few, even virtually.

Friendships are really important in both good times and bad times, and I would be grateful for the opportunity to be able to support one another. Truth be told that today is not the best of days, but I think that is all the more reason to pursue more meaningful friendships.

The most important thing to me in the conversations would be honesty and consistency. It would be great to receive that, and I would be happy to do the same.

Chennai’s food scene is drowning in monotony. Every so-called “new” restaurant is just a recycled version of the last, serving the same South Indian staples, predictable North Indian fare, and an uninspired selection of biryanis. There’s no risk, no creativity just another place with dosa, butter chicken, and some half hearted continental menu thrown in for “variety.”

And don’t even get started on cafés. How many more overpriced “artisanal” coffee shops does this city need, all serving the same mediocre sandwiches, generic pasta, and factory made desserts repackaged as “gourmet”? Where’s the innovation? Where’s the boldness? Why does every menu look like it was copied from the next?

Street food has its charm, but even that has turned into an Instagram driven gimmick. Every stall selling the same overloaded sandwiches, shawarmas, and momo variants because god forbid someone actually experiment beyond the usual trends. Meanwhile, the real gems the small joints that actually cook with soul are overshadowed by the latest overhyped fusion nonsense that disappears in six months.

And then there’s the ridiculous food “recommendations.” LBB Chennai put up a post today on 15 spots serving the flakiest croissants, and I laughed my ass off. Only *one* place in that entire list serves a decent croissant, the rest? Absolute mediocrity. Dry, dense, flavourless layers that should be illegal to call “flaky.” It’s like these lists are compiled by people who’ve never actually eaten good food but just regurgitate whatever looks pretty on Instagram.

Chennai needs something *different*. Not another “authentic Chettinad” place, not another lifeless multi-cuisine menu, and definitely not another “rooftop dining experience” that serves the same damn paneer tikka. Where are the regional explorations, the bold flavours, the game changers? Right now, it's just a never-ending cycle of the same old, and it’s exhausting.",44,1738254687.0,Chennai,24,0.98,False

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I love the woven wall decor but idk if it would match with a beach portrait. And yes we're going to change the tv for a bigger one and lower it.  We're either going to add panels to the tv wall or frames.

I want it to taste rich and creamy without a weird aftertaste, but so far nothing I've bought has even come close to oatly barista milk. 

I was wondering if anyone knows which ingredient I could add to cashew or hazelnut milk that prevents it from curdling in coffee? I already used soy lecithin to make sure my cashew milk emulsifies with the added oil and the result was okay, but not as creamy as I hoped. I also ordered guar gum after I found a recipe for cashew milk and hope it will help with the consistency. 

But after reading a bit, I figured I also need some kind of acid regulator to keep the ph level stable so the acidity of the coffee won’t cause the milk to split. Is this correct? I was thinking about ordering some calcium carbonate, has anyone of you tried it? ",12,1738253988.0,vegan,0,1.0,False
