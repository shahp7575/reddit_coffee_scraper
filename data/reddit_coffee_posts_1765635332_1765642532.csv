well didnt like it etc etc eventually he reached out to me saying via a councelor so to speak before u see each other again (didnt happen yet due to me leaving 2 hours early now him also not always being there this was 3 weeks ago) that he did really like the contact we had there but that contact outside of the place is a bit much rn

which i understand fully and i said if the councler could say to him that i understand and if he ever wants to do something he can just send a message

and im fine with that bit of a bumer but im fine with that problem is idk if it actually was that reason or because of the joke but i cant do anything else than take his word

1plp1if,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenHFY/comments/1plp1if/the_colors_of_war_white_chapter_1/,"The Colors of War: White, chapter 1","""Admiral Hudson, with only two days remaining until our arrival at Optun, what is the projected timeline for initiating colony construction?"" inquired Governor Penn. Governor William Penn, a seasoned and imposing figure known for his direct and unyielding demeanor, a trait honed during his service as a captain in the Reunification Wars. ""Ah, Governor Penn, always a pleasure,"" Admiral Hudson responded, a hint of weariness in his voice. ""As per our most recent update, the SSAS Arizona is scheduled to arrive 20 hours prior to our vessel. Captain Gomez and her scout teams will then conduct a comprehensive planetary survey to identify an optimal settlement location."" Admiral Hudson stated, now directing his gaze at Governor Penn, who was seated at his desk. ""Admiral, I require a definitive timeline for my colonists; their eagerness to commence operations is palpable."" ""Governor Penn, I will furnish an updated schedule upon receipt of the scouting reports from Captain Gomez. In the interim, I kindly request your and the colonists' patience. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have pressing matters to attend to."" A subtle sigh of relief escaped the Admiral as the visibly irritated Governor departed his office.


The SSAS Arizona was one of three battleships assigned to this mission. Admiral Hudson dispatched them in advance not only to commence planetary reconnaissance but also to preempt any unforeseen threats. ""Wilson, Herrera, Reid wants you two in his office,"" a marine said. ""Thanks, Cpl,"" Wilson replied after putting his weights back. ""The LT has perfect timing, always needing us when we're busy,"" Herrera grumbled. ""Shut up, Herrera, let's go change, the sooner we talk to him, the sooner we eat."" ""Got it, SSG,"" Marvin replied as they walked to the locker room.


2LT Reid was a last-minute addition to his platoon after the previous leader got benched because of a training injury. Reid's door chimed, ""Come in."" Staff Sergeant Wilson and Sergeant Herrera walked into the office and sat down across from him. Reid's interactions with his unit were mostly just inspections, training, and giving out basic orders. He didn't have much in common with his guys, and even though he wouldn't admit it, he wasn't really all that keen on getting chummy with them.""You called for us, sir?"" Wilson asked. ""Captain Gomez wants more teams to go scout the planet,"" Reid paused briefly. ""Given your recent promotion, Staff Sergeant, I am assigning you and the Sergeant here to lead a team of Marines, accompanied by a geospatial expert, to map your designated sector,"" Reid stated professionally. ""Sir, why are we sending teams down? Don't we have scanners for that?"" Herrera asked. ""Sergeant Herrera, you are hereby to adhere to directives. Your role does not involve questioning command,"" Reid stated firmly. ""Staff Sergeant, prepare your team for deployment; you will be shipping out immediately following our FTL exit. I will expect both of you at the briefing tomorrow at 1430. Now, if you would both kindly exit my office."" Reid concluded, visibly annoyed.""Understood, sir,"" they both affirmed before promptly exiting the office. ""I have a feeling he doesn't like us; I mean, seriously, it was just a simple question,"" Herrera said as they walked down the corridor.""He's not here to like us, he's here to give out orders. I know he's not like our old LT but you also should know when not to ask stupid fucking questions Marvin. Now let's get our team together and get our gear situated, we don't have a lot of time."" Wilson replied. ""what about chow? Thought you were hungry."" Said Herrera. ""I'll make sure you'll have all the push-ups you want for dinner if you don't stop, now move."" Wilson said jokingly while racing to get ready. 


Captain Alex Gomez was deep in contemplation within the briefing room as the scout team leaders took their seats. ""In the academy, I never thought I'd be in this position,"" she thought, reminiscing about her time in the Navy. ""Admiral, I am not intimately familiar with Captain Gomez's capabilities; what is your assessment of her reliability?"" inquired Governor Penn, seated opposite the Admiral's desk. ""Even if her father had not served as my commander during the war, I would have personally selected her for this mission,"" Admiral Hudson responded before taking a sip of his coffee. ""Despite its brevity, her career has been exemplary. She graduated at the top of her class at the academy, demonstrates exceptional composure under duress, and was instrumental in saving lives when she assumed command of her vessel after three RED syndicate ships ambushed them, resulting in the loss of the Captain and Executive Officer in the initial assault. She is tactically astute, decisive, and fiercely dedicated to her crew,"" Hudson elaborated. ""I trust we will not require the full extent of her skills, Admiral, for if we succeed, we will establish the precedent for this initiative,"" the Governor stated as he rose to depart the office.


""The planet's gravitational pull is 1.5 times that of Earth, so please account for increased fatigue. Additionally, given our limited knowledge of the local wildlife, it is imperative to treat all indigenous species as potentially hostile until their disposition can be definitively ascertained. This concludes my briefing. Captain, would you care to add any further remarks?"" inquired the Commander. ""Yes, thank you, Commander,"" Gomez responded as she approached the podium. ""The nature of your task should be self-evident. In five hours, your teams will achieve a historic milestone as the first humans to set foot on a planet beyond the Sol System. Upon landing, I anticipate swift and efficient execution, Marines; do not disappoint the colony. Your assignments have been distributed; you are dismissed."" Gomez concluded before proceeding to the Commander as the briefing hall emptied.


Subsequent to the briefing, Staff Sergeant Wilson and Sergeant Herrera advanced into the corridor.""You nervous?"" Herrera asked Wilson. ""Why would I be nervous? It's a scouting mission."" Wilson replied. ""Its your first time leading mission and its on a planet no human has been on. Hell im nervous."" Herrera stated. ""Im not nervous, but I am curious. We were given a mission and im going to fulfil said mission. Lets get staged, I need to talk to this geospatial expert about developing a plan for our sector. After that we can grab chow before our next hit time."" Said Wilson as the two walk towards the staging area.


Wilson and Herrera entered the staging area with their equipment, where their team was already assembled.""Staff Sergeant Wilson, I'm Corporal Chen from Headquarters. I'll be serving as your communications specialist. These three individuals are Private First Class Shaw, Private Pena, and Private Brewer, all of whom have been reassigned from 3rd Platoon."" Corporal Chen introduced Wilson's team as they organized their equipment. ""Thank you for the introduction, Corporal,"" Wilson responded while reviewing his roster. ""Our geospatial expert, Chief Warrant Officer Alec, would you happen to have seen him? I'd like to review the mission with both of you."" Wilson inquired. ""Negative, Staff Sergeant, but he should arrive momentarily. His office is located slightly further than ours,"" Chen replied. Shortly thereafter, Chief Warrant Officer Alec entered the area. He was a tall individual, standing at six feet four inches, with a physique well-suited for the field. ""Staff Sergeant Wilson, Chief Warrant Officer Alec, I hope I'm not late,"" the Chief Warrant Officer stated as he greeted Wilson. ""No, sir, I've just arrived myself. I simply wanted to review our sector with you while you have a moment,"" Wilson responded. ""No problem at all, let me just set down my gear,"" the Chief said, while Wilson addressed the others, ""Herrera, Chen, please remain here. The rest of you are dismissed for chow and any remaining tasks; you have two hours."" ""Roger, Staff Sergeant,"" they replied.",1,1765642358.0,OpenHFY,0,1.0,False

The trip continues! Yesterday was a lot of fun, after I got my Mühle stick shave in. We found out the starter was finally installed on the car. It required 5 hours of labor, because the intake needed to be removed for access. On the way to picking up the car we dropped off some Amazon returns at Kohls, and my mom bought me a nice purple dress shirt, that goes well with the sport coat I got the night of the concert. 

We headed up to the BMW dealer and exchanged the loaner for Lili. Lili is a special little car: a 2006 Z4 M Coupe. She has the famous S54 engine from the e46 M3. It is arguably one of the best M cars for the driving experience it provides. They don’t make cars like this anymore. It provides an analog driving experience with enough modern conveniences. This one doesn’t have the optional folding navigation system that is outdated, an eyesore on the dashboard, and commonly squeaks. 

The engine it has is a work of art. It is naturally aspirated, has 6 individual throttle bodies, solid lifters, oil squirters, variable valve timing, cast iron block, forged connecting rods, and crank. This car doesn’t like to be short shifted, it begs to be rung out. The redline of this engine is 8000rpm. This all adds up to a power output in US spec of 333hp from just 3.2 liters of displacement. 

The Z4M Coupe was only available with a 6 speed manual transmission and it was a sales flop, Selling about 4581 units worldwide and 1815 to the United States. Something else interesting about this car is it was manufactured in the United States in Spartenburg South Carolina and is one of the last M vehicles to use hydraulic power steering.

 I convinced my mom to pick one up years ago with the idea it might appreciate in value due to its rarity. This didn’t pan out: I believe she would have made a profit if she sold it in the middle of covid, but the car at least held its value. This example only has only 21,000 miles.

After we got the car back we went to a restaurant called Jimmy P’s where I had my 3rd filet of the trip. 😊 We stopped at my Mom’s condo after eating to drop off her leftover ribs and regroup. I took my ADD medication to stay sharp on the road. People down here are pretty wild. I grabbed a jacket and phone charger and we were off to Marco Island.

We had a nice drive. It was pretty scenic and traffic wasn’t too bad. We got to see a lot of bodies of water. My phone said we were a few feet below sea level. Most of it was 2 lane roads and I got to overtake some vehicles driving under the speed limit. It is fun to wind out the engine, She really sings! 😁 I think it has a good amount of power for the street, much more and you are begging to lose your license. 

We got a little lost on the way back, but my phone helped guide us back home. The sun was setting as we drove home. We pulled in just as it was getting dark. I sat down and typed this to include in my SOTD as I talked on the phone with my wife. 

My mom and I didn’t have any definite plans for the rest of the day, we were both still full from the big lunch so we decided to stay in and have a snack. My mom went to bed and I took out the bimmer on a night drive by myself. 

I got it out on I75 North and took it to redline. The car is a blast to drive! I drove east to US41 south and to downtown Naples and saw some very rare vehicles, a Ferrari of some sort, 2 McLarens, a Porsche GT3 and a GT3RS. When I got home, I talked with my wife on the phone and went to bed, reflecting on my great day. 

Today I woke up 19 minutes before my alarm went off… wonder why? I took care of my call of nature, threw on some clothes and took Lili for a drive before traffic picked up. This car is very rewarding to drive. It reminds me of my Blackland Ti Blackbird, it is fairly lightweight for a modern car, has great handling and is somewhat unforgiving. Nailing a perfect heel-toe shift is like getting a perfect shave with no irritation. 😊

On the way back a Porsche 918 turned onto the same road I was going. I got to follow it for a while and politely pass it while getting a good gander at the fluorescent green example. The 918 originally started at $845,000. These days the cheapest 918 listing is for $2,100,000, lower milage examples are going for over $3 million, and here it was just casually driving down the road and stopping to get gas. 

Anyway I drove Lili until the gas light came on. I wanted to get it low to fill it with fresh fuel since this car sits most of the time. I made it back safely to my mom’s and started my routine. I set up my shave picture and had some coffee to wake up more while watching car videos on YouTube. That brings us to the actual SOTD:…

For today’s shave, I brought Speick Rasiercreme. I like the smell of it and the performance is good. I chose to use my Timeless Aluminum Slant, which was probably my favorite razor until I got my Konsul. It is really a nice little razor and not too expensive to travel with. 

I used the silicone collapsable bowl to lather in with my Mühle travel brush. I brought an Omega boar just in case I didn’t like the Mühle, but the Mühle brush has been great and is very compact. 

The shave went well. I detected a hint of feedback from the alum block. The shave was nice and close: DFS quality. I applied Thayers, Pinaud Lime Sec, aftershave, and Nivea sensitive after shave balm from a cute little 1oz bottle.

I believe the plan for today is to drive to Sarasota to look around. My mom is probably going to insist on buying me something, which is nice, but after she got me an iPad Pro I almost feel guilty accepting anything more. She does like to spoil me and I’m her only child so I guess it’s a win for both of us.

Anyway that is what I have been up to since my last post. I have been having a good time. Being a US citizen I don’t go on vacation often. I included some pictures of Lili in this post, and lunch from yesterday. Lili  is a good girl. 😁

Here is review of the car, if you are in the market I would highly recommend it:

(Low Flow / High Flow / Pullman 876),"Hey all — looking for a sanity check from the hive mind. (Flair 58+2, DF64 gen 2)

I’ve been dialing in shots without pre-infusion and getting consistently great results:

•	Ratio: \\\~1:2 to 1:2.5

•	Time: \\\~30 seconds-ish

•	Taste/texture: balanced, clean, not overly heavy. A bit too acidic but i like clarity.

•	Weirdly consistent detail: across different baskets (Low Flow / High Flow / Pullman 876) and coffee beans, I was landing on basically the same grind setting (15) to hit those numbers (unless using a wet paper filter with the 876, then it goes finer a click or two)

Then I started adding pre-infusion and everything got… confusing.

Current pre-infusion: 2 bar for 5–10 seconds

What I’m seeing now:

•	Shots are running faster

•	Texture/body feels heavier / muddier like a French press.

•	And now I’m needing more grind variance between baskets, which is I assumes good thing?

With a Pullman 876, and pre infusion with a wet paper filter — it’s simultaneously coming out too fast, and has a lot of oil/body. And this is with going all the way to a 12 grind.

So… what’s the most likely culprit here?

•	Is my pre-infusion causing puck damage/channeling and creating a fast path? It LOOKS perfect post pull, top and bottom.

•	Do I actually need to grind finer just to regain resistance / stabilize flow (even if it risks more body)?

•	Or should I be tweaking PI time/pressure instead (shorter PI? lower bar?). It’s currently 1:2.5 and 10 seconds of pre infusion and coming out in 15 seconds.

Would love to hear what you’d try first, especially from anyone who’s messed with these baskets and similar pre-infusion settings.",1,1765641876.0,FlairEspresso,0,1.0,False

1plos6g,https://i.redd.it/p0rs7ivavz6g1.jpeg,Best Reference book without being too complicated? Is that even possible?,"I've been knitting for about 15 years. Definitely a casual knitter, meaning if it's too complicated, I'm not interested. But that's relative. I've done lace work shawls and created my own sweater pattern, but it's all been very ""well I'll give it a try"". Hats and sweaters in the round? No problem, I've knit many many of those. But I've never successfully knit a sock. Might never try again. 

I knit how I cook: learn the basics and then make the rest up, and don't attempt anything so hard that my ignorance will hurt me. 

To me, I'm a casual knitter. I love it, but I don't deep dive on it. 

I'm posting this question in this sub for a reason.  

In reading other knitting subs on here, I'm realizing that the stuff I either didn't know, I need to know, or if I refused to learn it and now think I was being dumb and stubborn, well, they can matter. 

Comments in other subs like ""that happens when you knit with pure wool"" or "" the drape with X yarn will never be as great as Y yarn"" make me see that my obstinance can cost me time and patience when my project doesn't turn out because I didn't know what I didn't know. You know? 

But I don't want to be buried in excessive information. 

I got this book from the library in an attempt to learn what I don't know. And sure, it's great, has tons of info, some of which I need, other stuff is not at all relevant to me (I get how to cable, but patterns with cabling don't interest me). 

Is there a reference book you can suggest for the casual knitter? Specifically the effect of knitting with diff types of yarn (not their weight but their content), and tips for common issues (like holes in the underarm when you pick up sleeve sts). 

Yes, I can learn all this online, in videos and chats, but I look at a computer/my phone for work all day and I'm so tired of it. I want a book that I can make notes in and carry around with me. 

I have lots of pattern books (12 types of socks, or by various designers) and in all of them I'm betting I can find this info, a bit in each book. But I'd like it all in one. But not as involved as this Vogue reference book. 


And I can understand why such a book might not exist, or be very good, and I'm cool with that and ok to pivot. I'm equally happy to buy a similar reference type of book as this one, with too much info, but not this huge or this heavy. This is not a portable book, is a coffee table reference encyclopedia type of book. 

I recognize that having extra info is great if I decide to go deeper. I just don't want to have to parse through so much to find what I need right now. 


TL;DR: Do you have a go-to book for knitting tips and teaching that isn't a brick? Share the title please!

It's like a shadow that hides in certain corners of life, lurking in the nooks and crannies of our existence. As insidious as it is prevalent, alcoholism affects not only the individual struggling with it but also the ever-widening circle around them. 

There was this Tuesday last month, half-past eight in the evening; my coworker “Sam” excused himself from a late work-related meeting. Nothing unusual, he’d been on his third coffee for the day. But running into him later near a neighborhood bar, I recognized the red around his eyes. It wasn't fatigue, it wasn’t a long day. It was the glaze that shrouds a deeper problem, prowling beneath the surface. 

Such instances make me ponder; what is it that makes us reach for that one too many? Is it pain, stress, an escape from the mundane? Honestly, the reason often fades in comparison to the ripple effect it creates. 

So here's what I've been wondering, how does one start a conversation concerning alcoholism, without it becoming a confrontation? Any varying experiences or advice would be much appreciated.",1,1765641513.0,alcoholism,2,1.0,False

Nothing dramatic, no breakdowns or emergencies, just one of those moments that quietly teaches you what van life actually is.

I’d parked for the night on the edge of a public land area I found through a random tip from another traveler at a gas station. He said it was quiet, flat, and usually empty. He was right about the quiet part. By the time the sun went down, I was completely alone, surrounded by open land and a sky full of stars.

That evening felt perfect at first. I cooked a simple meal on my little stove, sat on the step of the van, and watched the light disappear. No noise, no people, no schedule. This was the kind of moment I imagined when I first decided to live on the road.

Around midnight, the temperature dropped way more than I expected. I was inside the van, half asleep, when I realized my bedding wasn’t enough. I didn’t panic, but I also didn’t sleep. I layered every piece of clothing I owned, wrapped myself in a spare towel, and still felt the cold creeping in.

Lying there in the dark, I started thinking about how van life is often described as carefree and spontaneous. The truth is, it’s constant decision-making. Did I park in the right spot? Did I check the weather properly? Do I have what I need if things change overnight?

I didn’t sleep much, but I learned something important. Van life isn’t about perfect Instagram sunsets. It’s about adapting without losing your cool. It’s about solving small problems quietly and accepting that discomfort is part of the deal.

By morning, the cold had lifted. I made coffee with stiff hands, watched the sun come up, and laughed at myself a little. I wasn’t miserable. I wasn’t scared. I just felt more aware.

That night changed how I approach the road. I started planning just enough to stay comfortable, but not so much that I lost the sense of freedom. I learned to respect the environment instead of assuming it would always cooperate.

-VAN - (gov pack) from parking ng buses, tawid ka. Tapat lang din siya ng partas, sa gilid ng mga kainan dun, may pila ng pa - la union sa gabi. Warning: umaabot ang pamasahe ng ₱200 sa van at ₱300 pag SUV (SUV ang sinakyan ko). Tamang tantsa sa oras kasi mahaba na ang pila, limited din ang oras nila.

2am ang first trip ng SAN FERNANDO LU - BATAAN TRANSIT (destination: Mariveles) - fare: ₱616
Kaya bumyahe ako ng around 8pm from Baguio, nakarating ng around 10:30pm, bumaba sa plaza, nagtrike papuntang 2nd home coffee shop kasi mejo malapit sila sa plaza na 24/7 na bukas, saka dun naghintay ng oras.

Naglakad ako pabalik ng plaza.
*Warning: walang tao sa gabi kaya mejo nakakatakot. Pero safe naman maglakad.

Sakay ulit trike papuntang Bataan Transit terminal
₱150 ata binayaran namin (2 kami).

Sakay ng bus at 2am. Destination: Mariveles
Pero ang sasabihin sa conductor ay Balanga.

*Bababa kayo sa Balanga, Bataan. Ang bababaan eh yung tapat ng jollibee. (Sa jollibee kami ngabreakfast. Around 9am kami nakarating)

From jollibee, tawid kayo sa sakayan ng trike, sakay papuntang sm bataan dahil doon ang Bataan Terminal Complex. Less than ₱100 ang binayaran sa trike.
*Kung open na ang SM, I highly encourage you to buy snacks and water first kasi dalawa lang ang resto sa loob ng las casas at ginto ang bilihin doon. 

Hanapin ang Modern jeepney papuntang Bagac, ₱70 ang pamasahe.
*Nakakaaliw kasi kelangan mong magsulat sa clip board ng name at kung san ka bababa.

Baba kayo sa Petron.

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a basketball spectacle where the Wichita State Shockers, armed with a 5-0 home record and a defense tighter than a drumhead, host the DePaul Blue Demons, who’ve turned road games into a tragicomic romp through a minefield of close losses and questionable three-point decisions. Let’s dissect this clash with the precision of a stat geek on a coffee high and the humor of a stand-up comedian who’s seen too many overtime losses.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Shockers Are the Favorite

The numbers scream “Wichita for the win” louder than a fan in the student section. The Shockers are a perfect 5-0 at home this season, where they allow a stingy 67.3 points per game. DePaul, meanwhile, is 1-7 against teams with a winning record this year—a stat that might as well be “1-7 in morality tests” given their current predicament.

The key stat? Wichita’s offense shoots 45.3% from the field, while DePaul’s defense allows 42.5% shooting to opponents. That 2.8% gap? It’s the difference between a team that *scores* and a team that *prays*. DePaul’s offense, meanwhile, relies on three-pointers (34.1% from deep, sixth in the Big East), but their 32.6% three-point accuracy (via CJ Gunn) is about as reliable as a weather forecast in Kansas.

The moneyline odds back this up: Wichita is a decimal favorite of \~1.31 (implied probability of 76.3%), while DePaul’s 3.55 odds (28.2% implied) suggest bookmakers think the Demons have about as much chance as a snowball in a sauna. The spread? Wichita -7.5. If you’re betting on DePaul to cover, you’re basically betting that a turtle will beat a hare in a race—*unless* the hare takes a nap mid-race.

### News Digest: Injuries, Home Struggles, and a Sprinkling of Absurdity

Wichita’s last game was an overtime thriller against Northern Iowa, where TJ Williams dropped 18 points and 9 rebounds. DePaul, meanwhile, just obliterated Morgan State 92-49, but that’s like saying a cheetah “wins” against a sloth—impressive, but not exactly a barometer of elite talent.

DePaul’s road struggles are legendary. They’re 1-1 in neutral-site games and 3-4 at home, but their true nemesis? Te

1plod8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Afrofuturism/comments/1plod8q/the_hero_is_a_nuclear_monster/,The hero is a nuclear monster.,"Chapter 1: The Roach

This gods-blasted place didn’t even have a name. It was just another part of the endless wastes. The - mostly irradiated - scars left from the great wars.

Beneath a sky of sickly yellow clouds, the air reeked of rotten eggs and other things, best left unmentioned. The ground was nothing but dirt and sand, peppered with the ruins of the old world—massive structures poking out of the earth like the fingers of decrepit corpses.

A moth-eaten tent flap, wedged between rusted metal and piled sandstone, was shoved aside. A boy emerged. He had no name. People simply knew him as the Roach.

Why?

Because that’s essentially what he was. He lived in trash, ate what he could scavenge, and he just WOULD NOT DIE.

Pustules and scabs covered most, if not all, of his coffee-colored skin. His curly hair was a matted, twisted nest, knotted where it hadn’t fallen out entirely. His right leg was gone, lost years ago, when it turned into a tasty morsel for the pack of mutated dogs that got the jump on a child too distracted by hunger to pay attention. 

That alone should have been the end of him.

His remaining leg couldn’t even straighten properly anymore. The legacy of countless beatings, of bones broken again… and again… and again…

One of the boy's eyes was permanently squinted. The other? The other was wide awake. It shone with an intelligence that was unnatural here, in a place where numbness was the only salvation. Staying alive was the goal;anything else was a luxury.

Something else could be seen in those light-brown, almost amber eyes. There was steel in there. A defiance that seemed to  challenge the world itself. A flat rejection of the very idea of death.

That very look was what always got him into trouble.

The grown-ups hated it.

Here they were, struggling to eke out an existence in this rotten place; what right did this runt have to look at them with those eyes?

The wastes had a hierarchy. 
Like animals, the weak did not look the strong in the eye.

The Roach however, refused to bend.

He’d been thrown off cliffs. His water had been stolen. He’d eaten poisonous bugs out of sheer hunger. But he just WOULD NOT DIE.

He’d learned his lesson, though. That’s why he lived alone. There were some scattered communities in the wastes, but he avoided them. The people there shunned him, beat him, then threw him out anyway. 

He didn't have a mother. None that he knew of anyway. The old woman who’d raised him along with a dozen other children, had said that his mother died in childbirth. Even then, they’d barely fed him. He was ignored. But he survived. Because he was a roach.

No time for those memories.

Today was the day to check the white ship.

The wastes had plenty for those who knew how to look. The Roach had learned much from corrupted data banks and flickering holographic avatars. The Marauder,  also paid well for working Old World tech, and he’d become one of their favorite… trading partners.

The white ship was the most intact ruin he’d ever come across. A structure as large as a small mountain, or at least the part he could see above the rusty brown-red sand.

You’d think a prize like that would have been picked clean decades ago. However, he was confident that it hadn't. For one good reason.

The sand around it was not dry. Rivulets of what looked like pristine, clear water ran through the dust.

A lie.

A death sentence for fools.

That water was radioactive. It burned any flesh it touched, like acid. 

But for the creatures that lived here, it was life. A corrupted, almost demonic spring of life.

Bushes the color of charcoal dotted the large field. Not to forget the patches of equally black and oily moss that grew alongside the streams. Between them moved creatures that made even the marauders puke.

Sandworms longer than an entire caravan. Wolves that looked more like walking cancer. And then there were the ‘fish’. 

He’d heard of  creatures called fish in the archives. Some of the creatures looked like them, if you squinted, really, really hard. Their bodies had far too many legs, like scorpions, but they DID have the tails of fish—of that he was certain. He'd never seen any other creatures with tails like those.

The other predators gave the ‘fish’ a wide berth. The things moved slowly, mostly lying motionless. Anything that got too close discovered their sluggishness was nothing but a facade.

Mouths wide enough to swallow entire boulders whole, would unfurl from their grotesque bodies, swallowing prey whole before they could even blink. Nothing ever fought back once inside that tent-like mouth; the Roach had seen outlines of creatures simply standing inside there stoically… for hours… until they slowly dissolved into nothing.

He did NOT want to know how or why. BUT, it had given him his opportunity.

He’d learned to sneak up on the ‘fish’ as they ate. Only the weaker ones on the outskirts. They were like snakes while eating, blind to the world.

As they concentrated on their meal, he would scavenge the thick mucus that dripped from the pink, cloth-like lining of their mouths. He covered himself with it.

The potent aroma kept the larger predators at bay. The weaker ones he could simply hide from.






The prosthetic leg he’d built for himself clanked and groaned in protest, as he jumped from his boulder perch. 

The thing was a monstrosity of scrap—an ankle joint from some old vehicle, a foot slapped together from half rusted leaf springs. It creaked, cut his skin, and made his hips ache. None of that mattered though. 

The piece of junk was the only reason he could still move. Still survive. There was no one to save him here. This place was every rat—every roach—for himself.

Slathered from head to toe—the toes he still had—in slime and filth, he began his slow, painful shuffle across the open field toward the white ship.

He smelled like an “aroma’ -an unholy stench-, rich enough to make even sandworms lose their meals. How he could still breathe was a miracle in and of itself.

After an hour of sneaking past stragglers that somehow ignored the… aroma…of the ‘fish’ he finally reached the hull. 

It was unbelievable. 

It looked less like metal and more like bleached white bone. Unlike everything else in the wastes, it wasn’t covered in rust. It had holes in it… but otherwise… nothing. Nothing was bent, no cracks… nothing. It was almost as if the holes were always there.

It reminded the Roach of the camouflage that some nomads used. They made their camps look weak and destitute on purpose. Anyone who tried to raid them found the dirty tents hid more steel than an armory. Then quickly turn from predators to prey.

Mesmerized by the - almost- clean white frame of the thing, he hobbled on his now painful leg to the nearest isolated hole. 

Just to be sure, he took the time to pile pieces of sandstone  inside the entrance, sealing himself in. Finally, he was inside.

Darkness, broken by shafts of sickly light from other holes. And deeper inside, a single pinprick of blue light.

TREASURE!

It had to be. 
Only LED light was that blue. LED meant working tech.

The Roach limped and hobbled, shuffling towards the light. A dull, hollow echo marking his steps.

So close…

When he reached it, he almost couldn’t believe his eyes. 

It was a hologram projector. It looked almost new—sleek, no exposed wires. He bent down, his prosthesis scraping his knee, and snatched it up after a few choice curses.

He held it close to his face, admiring the intricate lines of text on its smooth surface, the—


The ground opened up and swallowed him.

Darkness followed. He was weightless as it sped upwards, marked only by small lights that twinkled as they rushed past.

Something sharp stabbed into his shoulder, snagging him trying to stop his downwards fall 

It failed 

He kept falling.

His head banged against the walls of the narrow space. Again. And again. And again.

It felt like that time he’d been caught sneaking into that gang’s food store. 

The groaning of his metal joint had alerted the guards. They had not hesitated in treating him to some  ‘tender love and care’. 

One of them had given particular care to his head and face.

That was when he’d earned the ‘gift’, that was his permanently squinted eye. 

That guy had hit the roach's head more times than he could remember with that metal pipe. The rust from it had painted his hair and mixed with his blood. 

The pipe played a stuttering beat on his skull until the world started to sing.

Just like it did now.

The ringing melodies switched sides in his head with every new blow. 

His nose seemed to clear, before smelling of that oh so rare taste of leaves.

The taste of rust once again filled his mouth.

Then came the butterflies, his stomach felt like it had come alive.

Finally, when he could no longer even remember how he'd ended up here, it stopped.

He crashed into something soft. Like a sand dune, but softer. Wetter.


Was that water? But how could there be so much, just lying around? Did the Old World truly have such miracles?

Despite the pain, the Roach smiled.

The thought of being INSIDE water was exhilarating.

The darkness took him as he fantasized of ruling the wastes as the water king.

Yung tipong although at a very young age, I’d like to chime into adult conversations, I’d always be told off na “wag makisabay sa usapang pangmatanda,” now I grew up not talking unless I’m spoken to, kasi yun yung nakasanayan ko even though I beat myself everytime someone tells me na “napapanis ba yung laway mo” and they don’t know how much I want to talk to them so badly but I just enjoy listening and push myself to think of something to say.

Yung tipong, I left my greatest love right away in HS because my parents told me not to have a boyfriend while in school, and I, heartbreakingly, followed. And I’ve been crying in agony since then because I got hurt na nahurt ko siya because of that.

Yung tipong, I never really went out of the house as a child except for school stuff, because my parents never allowed me to. I followed. And get sad everytime I get invited out because I know it’ll be one hell of a BIG task to simply ask my parents if I could go, just for them to decline in the end. Sometimes, I would decline right away because I know they’ll just never allow me to.

I never really gave any type of luxury for myself, makeup man o anything that I dont think is necessary na mahal (makeup, bags, clothes). Di ko iniisip o inaabala kasi di naman nagpapabuhay sakin. Kaya ko naman mabuhay ng wala yan, basta may komportableng damit at maayos na katawan lang. Mas lalaanan ko pa ng oras yung pag-aaral ko.

I’ve also always been the overachiever in my whole life. Nag-aaral ng libre sa top school in the country na di delayed. Madaming pangarap sa buhay.

But for my younger sister, who is, let’s say… the “rebellious” one. Na “paborito” daw ng family namin because she’s the “talkative” one. But admittedly, is the more disrespectful one. Who won’t introduce her visitors in the house to my parents (who would always tell her that it’s courtesy to introduce visitors and even initiate “mano”). Who has a “manliligaw” (but really is her boyfriend) that they would allow to come to the house for them to hangout,, and even allowed them to have a “closure” na hindi naman closure kasi naghhangout pa rin sila eventually for yearss. Who would not say thank you when I bring her coffee or do her favors. Who would always be the one to delay our family outings kasi “nagmamakeup pa” etc. Who would buy a lot of lavish stuff, makeup na pagkamahal mahal, etc. Who would always lash out at me (medyo bipolar tbh) when she’s “stressed”. Whenever she’s bastos, my parents would always say na “ganyan lang talaga siya, bastos talaga, pabayaan mo nalang” whenever, as an ate, would point out her disrespectfulness because not only me, but people outside my family who lived with us tell me about it.

Ewan ko ba bakit ang unfair ng world. I mean gets naman na siguro, my parents had their first experience parenting me as the older one and maybe got lenient with the younger one (who is just 1 year youunger than me), pero… ganito nalang kaya buong buhay ko? Totolerate nyo siya kasi ganyan talaga ugali nya??? Ewan ko nalang.

Ang hirap na maging masunurin pero di pa rin ikaw ang paborito. Ang hirap malabellan ng “masyado kang mabait” ng mga kaibigan mo (even if you just genuinely like helping other people). Ang hirap na maging tahimik sa lahat pero maingay sa mga taong comfortable ka, na parang ikinakahiya mo yung sarili mong kulo na nagpapasaya sayo. ANG SAKIT MAGING GOOD KID (I would never put my future kid in that box, ever!)

To me future family, I’ll do better for you. Ayaw kong maramdaman ‘to ng mga magiging anak ko, o ng sinuman. We’ll be the goofiest family ever, full of good vibes and love.

1ploaxn,https://i.redd.it/a8mc0mkqrz6g1.jpeg,Amy’s Diary – Saturday (Mom’s Birthday),"Dear Diary,

Today was Saturday, and it felt different the moment I woke up. The house was quiet in that something special is about to happen way. No rushing. No school bell in my head. Just soft morning light, the smell of coffee drifting down the hallway, and my belly gently reminding me that birthdays usually involve food.

But before I write about the surprises, I want to write about Mom. Because today was about her.


---

About Mom (Christina)

My mom, Christina, is the kind of person who notices everything.

She notices when one of us is quieter than usual.
She notices when the house feels messy because we’re tired, not because we’re careless.
She notices when I’m pretending I’m fine but my belly and my face say otherwise.

She’s warm in a way that isn’t loud. When she hugs you, she doesn’t rush. When she listens, she really listens. When we mess up, she sighs first… then laughs later… then fixes things with us instead of for us.

She always smells like clean laundry, soap, and something comforting—like home itself decided to become a person.

And even though she has nine daughters (which already makes her a superhero), she somehow makes each of us feel seen.

Including me.
Including my belly.
Especially on days when it causes trouble.


---

Morning – Operation Wake-Up (Success!)

We all woke up early without Mom noticing. This alone felt like a miracle.

Jennifer and Linda handled breakfast.
Melissa brewed coffee exactly how Mom likes it.
Heather arranged the living room cushions.
Nina hid the memory board behind the tree.
Gillian… supervised from the couch with a blanket.
Shelley stayed with me, making sure I didn’t get in the way.

I carried the tray with fruit.

Very carefully.

My belly stuck out just enough that I had to lean back slightly while walking.

“Slow,” Shelley whispered. “You’ve got this.”

“I’m walking like a penguin,” I whispered back.

My belly gave a small, confident blorp.

We lined up outside Mom’s bedroom.

“One… two… three—”

“Happy Birthday to you—”

The door opened mid-song.

Mom stood there, surprised, hair a little messy, eyes still sleepy.

And then she smiled.

The kind of smile that makes everything feel right.

“Oh my goodness…” she said softly.

We finished singing (mostly in tune), and then surrounded her in a giant hug.

My belly ended up right against her side.

She laughed and hugged me tighter.
“Good morning, my little sunshine.”


---

The Memory Board Reveal

After breakfast, Linda guided Mom to the living room.

“Sit,” she said mysteriously.

Nina stepped forward and revealed the memory board.

Photos from years ago.
Christmas mornings.
Silly faces.
Baby pictures.
Handwritten notes from each of us.

Mom covered her mouth.

She read slowly. Carefully.
Her eyes grew shiny.

Then she found my note.

She laughed when she read the part about Christmas lights… and my belly.

She looked up at me.

“Amy,” she said gently, “you make our lives brighter just by being you.”

My belly chose that exact moment to make a soft plorp sound.

She laughed again and kissed the top of my head.


---

Afternoon – School Break Bliss

Since it was my school break, I didn’t have to worry about homework or packing a bag. We went out for lunch, just like planned, and Mom kept holding my hand like I was still very little.

At the restaurant, I sat next to her.

My belly pressed lightly against the table edge, round and relaxed.

“You look very happy today,” she said.

“That’s because you’re happy,” I replied.

She smiled. “That’s a good reason.”


---

Evening – Cake Time (The Belly Was Ready)

At night, we gathered again in the living room.

The cake came out.

Candles lit.
Lights dimmed.

Mom closed her eyes to make a wish.

I watched her face glow in the candlelight and thought:
Please let her always feel this loved.

When we sang again, my belly tried to hum along.

“Behave,” I whispered.

It answered with a very quiet blorp this time, like it understood.

Mom cut the cake and gave me a slice.

“A big one,” she said knowingly.

“I raised you.”


---

The Quiet End of the Day

Later, when the house finally settled down, Mom sat beside me on the couch.

She rested her hand on my belly absentmindedly, the way she always does.

“Thank you for today,” she said. “All of you.”

I leaned into her.

“I’m glad you’re my mom.”

She kissed my hair.
“And I’m glad you’re my Amy.”


---

Now I’m in bed, writing this with my belly gently rising and falling under my pajamas.

Today was full of love.
No disasters.
No big accidents.

Just warmth, laughter, and a birthday that felt like home.

Goodnight, Diary.
And happy birthday, Mom.

Love,
Amy 💖🎂✨",1,1765640509.0,u_FunRestaurant3384,0,1.0,False

I don't know of a suitable TLDR, but I'll try to structure the text a bit.


**Personal introduction to the topic**

I am a very rational person. That's why it's important for me to know what's going on in my body. I'm also very curious, even though I've never had anything to do with medicine before. An odyssey of mistreatment and misdiagnosis that lasted over 10 years, in addition to my recent experiences, has made me doubt doctors. During a difficult phase of my illness, I vowed to do everything in my power until my deadline to understand what was happening and find ways to deal with it and perhaps even recover.
I spent many months researching, asking around, reading studies, watching videos and consulting doctors. I looked into every topic that was even remotely related to it. I wrote everything down, cited my sources, showed it to my doctor and did tests. I know my clinical picture and it helps me a lot.


But it didn't stop there. Anyone who knows me and who has already recognised me (including on Reddit) knows that I want to help. It's that people-pleasing thing I'll talk about later. My comments are sometimes cynical and direct, which has landed me on a few block lists (sorry not sorry). But basically, I want to share my knowledge in the hope that more people, not just those affected, can better understand the disease. I firmly believe that many sufferers could feel better if certain processes in the body were understood.


**The path to my website**

For this reason, I decided to create a website to gather my knowledge, especially because, to my knowledge, there are hardly any places where different body systems are explained in relation to each other. In addition to the mechanisms (mitochondria, nervous system, intestines, etc.), the website also contains testing options and explanations of nutrients and supplements. Structuring the texts alone took months. Learning how to create a website took time, not to mention obtaining image rights and translations into English. I am moderately affected, and at the beginning I was able to work on texts for 5 minutes a day. This has improved to 2 hours a day in recent weeks. Anyone affected by this condition can imagine how much energy and time went into it when you can only look at a screen for a maximum of 5 minutes at a time. But I had a goal, and writing has always helped me to distract myself. Together with the desire to help others affected by this condition, that was enough to tackle and complete this project.


I finished the website last month, which made me very happy. It gave me the feeling once again that I had achieved something despite my illness. Of course, I posted the website on Reddit, among other places, as it was created specifically for the purpose of helping others affected by the condition. I received feedback on it and took it on board.


**The straw that broke the camel's back**

I also posted it in r/cfs. Within minutes, the post was deleted and I was informed that spam and self-promotion would be removed. I contacted the mods because I don't consider my website to be self-promotion. What would there be to promote? The website contains about 4 hours of reading time on scientifically based processes in ME/CFS and PASC. It also has a ""buy me a coffee"" button where people can voluntarily donate to me as a thank you or to show their support. I think it's fair to include such a button for a website like this and the work that goes into it. In my opinion, this has nothing to do with self-promotion.


However, this was apparently enough to classify the post as self-promotion. I was also informed that donation traps are not tolerated. Classifying a Buy Me a Coffee button as a donation trap and self-promotion is an absolute joke, especially in this community, where there are grifters, scams and programmes costing thousands of pounds. A website that is clearly structured to help those affected, answering questions that can be read daily in the sub, which took an enormous amount of time to create, is declared spam and self-promotion because it has a voluntary donation button. It's a joke.
In another reply, I was then told that I could post the topics in text form on Reddit, so I wouldn't have to refer to an external source. So I'm expected to pack 4 hours of reading material into a Reddit post.


**Stop people-pleasing**

Well, while creating the website, I picked up on a few topics that I wanted to explore in more detail. I could imagine a kind of blog or even an Instagram page. For example, B12 and folate in the methylation cycle, chronic fatigue vs ME/CFS, or deep dives into vitamin D, calcium, the TCA cycle and their role in the disease.
However, I have to say that experiences like this make it clear to me that people-pleasing is harmful to me. I want to do all this to share knowledge, only to be deviled over and over again. This has been the case earlier in my life, and I know that many of you are familiar with it too. Putting a lot of effort into something, only to see it dismissed as a matter of course or defamed.


I need to work on that, and this incident has only made that clearer to me. I have therefore decided to take better care of myself. Fewer answers, less helping. It goes against my nature, but I have to learn to do it because I am not in a position to cope with it physically and mentally as I used to.


**The problem with linear forums**

Another user once said to me, ""It's difficult to help this community. You try, but the hurdles are extremely high."" And I find myself forced to agree with him.


A few days ago, someone asked why men post so little about their chronic illnesses on social media. I don't speak for everyone, and especially not just for men, but for me, it's experiences like this. A lot of work, little appreciation and a lot of gatekeeping and harassment. Why bother when people are always looking for the fly in the ointment? I can save myself the energy and take care of myself instead.


Events like this are demoralising. I have met many people who are very knowledgeable but have withdrawn from such forums. The effort of answering the same questions over and over again for other affected people is tiring. Especially when they are questions that have already been answered thousands of times (has anyone tried LDN? is a classic example). This is a shame because it means that many questions are no longer answered in a well-informed manner. Those affected want answers to their questions, but the people who could provide really well-informed answers are few. Precisely for these reasons. This leads to a loss of quality for the entire forum.
On the other hand, it is also because questions such as ""what is the role of histamine in LC/ME?"" cannot be answered adequately because the topic is very complex and multi-layered. There are so many processes that take place in the body with this disease that such questions cannot possibly be answered in a Reddit post. 


To understand such processes, it is necessary to read well-researched texts, and that takes energy and time. Please don't get me wrong here, I am well aware that our energy and cognitive capacity are severely limited. But you can't expect such complex mechanisms to be explained in 10 lines on Reddit. Yet that seems to be the expectation of some people: ""if it doesn't fit into a short Reddit answer tailored to me, I'm not interested or it's not worth reading"". The mechanisms of the disease don't become easier to understand just because we don't have the energy to understand them.
That was one of the reasons for my website. Instead of copying and pasting the same text over and over again as a response, I wanted to create a collection that I could refer to. We simply don't have the capacity to explain the role of histamine in LC/ME (as an example) every week.


The fact that this is then punished by being marked as spam is also a form of gatekeeping. I am aware that external sources must always be checked carefully. But I can also expect that helpful tools can be distinguished from scams or other dubious offers, especially when you are in direct contact with mods.


**Conclusion**

I have often had problems dealing with LC/ME in these forums in the past. They often exhausted and dragged me down. I took many breaks. With my improved personal condition, I thought I could take it up again. Also, to be able to interact socially. I was actually looking forward to creating a foundation with the website and then continuing. Be it as a blog or social media.
But experiences like this have shown me once again that my enthusiasm is not justified and that I ultimately suffer as a result. And I know that some other people feel the same way, people who have accumulated a lot of knowledge and would actually like to pass it on.
It's a shame that such people feel driven away.


Sorry for the long post. It's not only the post removal, it's just the whole people-pleasing and forum situation that dragged me down. As I said, writing is also an important element for me to see things more clearly and, for once, to post something to let off steam.

I grew up walking on eggshells.



My dad was a heavy gambler with a huge short fuse. As a kid, I learned to read Dads moods the second that he walked in.



One afternoon when I was about six, I accidentally put my favourite toy through the glass door of our lounge room cabinet. It  reated a large crack.



I froze. I was thinking in my mind. Dad comes home from the races, sees the cracked glass, and goes absolutely ballistic.  I was terrified.



But that day particular day had won big at the race track.



He walked in, sat next to the cracked glass. He saw it and looked at me and just laughed it off and made a joke of me looking so stiff. He literally didn't care about the cabinet. He was floating on a dopamine high, and suddenly, the ""disaster"" of the broken door meant nothing to him even though i knew he loved that cabinet. 



That moment stuck with me forever.



It forced me to realize something that I still struggle to apply in my own adult life: The event is neutral.



The glass was just glass. It had no emotion attached to it. The reaction depended entirely on the filter. If my dad had lost money that day, the glass would have been a tragedy. Because he won, it was a joke. The glass didn't change—his internal state did.



Now that I work as a counselor/coach, I try to teach this to clients, but I mostly have to teach it to myself.



Real  maturatiy isn't just paying bills; it's having the discipline to catchbyourself when things go wrong—a rude email, a flat tire, a spilled coffee—and asking:



""Am I actually mad at this situation? Or did I just 'lose at the track' earlier today?""



We can't always stop the glass from breaking. But the hardest part of self discipline is realizing we don't have to explode just because our parents did. Thanks for reading hope it helps somewhere.",8,1765640186.0,getdisciplined,0,1.0,False

I’m an age 40s woman from the Northeast US getting ready for a solo birthday trip for about 10 days in the first half of February. I have two possible itineraries, but I'm torn between them, and the more research I do, the more torn I become!

I’ve traveled extensively in the US, but only a little bit in Europe. For this trip, I want to focus on hiking, some history/art/culture, and taking it easy. For a sense of the style of travel I like: When my goddaughter and I traveled to Ireland we stayed on the coast not far from Kenmare. We’d wake up in the morning, get in the car, and meander down the Beara Peninsula, stopping for interesting hiking trails, old ruins, botanic gardens, megalithic stone sites, old cemeteries, or anything else that piqued our interest. All of it was amazing, and we never even made it down to the end of the peninsula because we didn’t want to rush and had too much fun just following our noses. We also took a kayak tour in one of the bays, and wandered around some towns, ducked into a pub here and there. I love grocery store tourism -- looking at all the options and picking things up to make a meal, and I like getting some kind of a sense of normal life. I don't worry too much about the big famous sights. When I got home, my aunt was scandalized I hadn’t seen the Cliffs of Moher, but I really didn’t feel deprived!

I’d like a similar vibe for this trip. I plan to stay mostly at chill hostels or small guesthouses. Since I’ll be alone it sounds nice to meet other travelers, but I’m certainly not looking for a party scene, and I like my alone time too. I’ll take hikes, poke around small towns or small cities, and enjoy the relative warmth and sunniness (compared to the Northeast US — I know it’s not going to be WARM exactly). I enjoy food, but I’m not looking for fine dining this time — more like good groceries, and casual places with delicious examples of local dishes. 

Here’s my thinking of the pros/cons of each so far:

Azores:

* I'd probably stay just on Sao Miguel Island -- seems like plenty to see and do for hiking etc., but open to other suggestions.
* I’ve read that it’s green all year, which would be an amazing in February.
* Hot springs. I adore hot springs, and this is a big draw for me. 
* I worry about over tourism, and really don’t want to contribute to the problem. I’ve read that tourism to the Azores has skyrocketed since Covid, and communities are getting strained. On the other hand, February seems like off-off-season, so perhaps I wouldn’t be contributing to as much of a problem then? 
* Relatedly, maybe there's not enough ""real life"" here for me? Does the whole island feel like it is just geared toward tourists? Are there coffee shops, music spots, bars where travelers are welcome, but don't make up the primary customer base? 

Alentejo:

* Hiking trails along the coast sound amazing. I wouldn’t be doing the whole Fisherman’s Trail end-to-end, but would do parts of it, along with some of the circle routes that go more interior. 
* I’d enjoy experiencing the cork forests and the dry interior landscapes. 
* Evora looks really interesting for wandering around and checking out history. I'm interested in the nearby megalithic sites too. 
* Seems like the weather would be a little cooler than Azores? What about rain?
* Although the majority of my trip would be a road trip in the Alentejo, I would probably spend a night or two in Lisbon to try food and visit the Museum of Liberty and Resistance and poke around. 

So: I’d love to hear your thoughts about what would be the better match for me. Thoughts on food in the two places? The potential for serendipitous finds in small towns? The weather? People's patience for and friendliness to tourists? Anything else I should consider? Thank you!!",2,1765640078.0,TravelPortugal,1,1.0,False

TL;DR: Mid-50s male, lost 82 lbs since mid-April. Strong cardio base (running + rowing). Now starting a muscle definition / strength-building phase. Recently added whey + creatine, weight up ~1 lb (probably water). Not asking about overall volume. Looking specifically for feedback on my 4 light resistance days.

---

Mid-50s male here. Since mid-April of this year I’ve lost 82 lbs, which still feels a little surreal. I’m now shifting out of pure fat loss mode and into a muscle definition / strength-building phase, with an emphasis on staying healthy and functional.

I wrapped up weight loss with solid bone density, an okay lean-mass ratio for my age, and a couple stubborn pounds of visceral fat still hanging around. My health went through the roof. No longer have high blood pressure, no longer need a cpap. My labs went from sludge to holy crap this guy is gonna live forever.

I don’t think I’m eating at a true caloric surplus yet, but figuring out calories and burn rate is a work in progress. Recently I’ve added whey protein post-workout, started creatine, and seen my weight bump up about 1 or 2 lbs, which I’m assuming is mostly water unless I discovered a cheat code. I will add some casein in the evening as I change from some weight loss era eating habits that are no longer serving me as well as they did.

Cardio is my happy place. It’s a big part of what I enjoy and what got me here.

Cardio

Running (3x/week): 4–5 miles; easy runs, stride repeats, progression runs

Rowing (3x/week, Concept2): Modified Pete’s Plan. Hard interval day, medium steady (~6k), long Zone 2/3 (~10k)

I run 2 or 3 other times a week. Just a couple of quick miles to hit my coffee spot and a mile back. I don't really consider that part of my excersize routine. 

I’m not asking about volume overall. I feel really good about my time balance, the volume works well for me so far, and recovery feels good. I’d like feedback on my 4 light resistance training days: exercise selection, balance/coverage, and any obvious gaps or swaps.

Worth noting that I’m currently stronger in my lower body than upper (not intentional emphasis, I just ran my way skinny), I’m missing a meniscus in my left knee so knee-friendly strength matters, I train at home with dumbbells and bodyweight only, and these are light-to-moderate very beginner loads. Goal is strength, some muscle definition, durability, and longevity, not necessarily max lifts.

You might see some odd excersize names for common things. I'm using Garmin to load and track workouts and some of their names are annoying AF and some don't exist. I've made workarounds.

That's my 4 light days. I wfh so I'm doing these either over lunch or if a mtg cancels. Occasional after work if I get slammmed. So can't really make them much longer.

Not looking to cut volume or lose my fun cardio. My VO2 max is rockin! Mainly looking for a check on exercise choice and balance, any knee-friendly improvements given the missing meniscus, and whether this makes sense as a long-term light lifting structure alongside endurance work. 

Ok that was a lot. I'm obsessing a little about getting this right and I'm only a few weeks in to the weights really. Still tweaking this. I excersize 7 days a week. With 3 running, 3 rowing, a 4 resistance theres some double days. This is working well so far. I've cut down on some runs to accommodate adding resistance and I think I've found the right schedule and balance.

I want to be moving forward. I feel great and I don't want to lose momentum and focus now that I'm done losing weight. I can't go backwards. I was fn huge, lazy, and unhealthy. I love the new me and am looking forward to an even newer me in the future.

So far I can feel the improvement each time I hit the weights. I want to make sure I'm being as effective as I can without upending my other priorities. I have a busy job, family/kids, other social and faith obligations, etc. So maximizing my efficiency is really helpful. Only so much time in the day.

1plo31w,https://www.reddit.com/r/fearofflying/comments/1plo31w/strategies_that_worked_for_me/,Strategies that worked for me,"Hello fellow scaredy cats. I just completed two of the longest flights I’ve ever been on from the US to Europe, first time traveling internationally and first time flying over the ocean. The flight there was about 8.5 hours and the flight back was about 9.5 hours. I was absolutely terrified in the days leading up to the flight to the point where I was ready to risk my job (it was a work trip) by bailing out the night before. However, I went in with a laundry list of strategies and overall had a really fantastic experience on both planes - even to the point where I could completely relax and just enjoy my time in flight.

I want to share what worked very well for me. This is a combination of things I found from this sub, talking to friends, and researching online:

1.	⁠⁠⁠No coffee / caffeine before either flight. I am a big coffee drinker, however coffee also makes me jittery and in turn amplifies my anxiety. I tried my best to have as little caffeine as possible and told myself that if I boarded a little sleepy, I might actually get some sleep on the plane.
2.	⁠⁠⁠I texted a link to track my flight to my family. This wasn’t because I thought anything bad was going to happen, but it’s comforting knowing that people you care about can check in on where you’re at. It almost felt like they were there with me, and I loved getting texts from my family saying that they just saw that I landed or that I was halfway there. It made me feel less alone.
3.	⁠⁠⁠Noise canceling headphones and a comfy neck pillow. As soon as I boarded, I got very comfortable in my seat, put on a big cushy neck pillow, and my noise canceling headphones with some relaxing music that I really enjoy. This was probably the MOST effective thing that I could have done. For me, the noises inside the cabin really freak me out (even though they are ALL perfectly normal sounds), so eliminating that with the noise canceling headphones really brought my anxiety down. With the big neck pillow, it really felt like I was in a pillow fortress.
4.	⁠⁠⁠With the noise canceling headphones and neck pillow, completely closing my eyes and focusing solely on the music (singing in my head) as soon as we began the taxi to the runway. I really liked doing this because it’s almost like I didn’t know when we were going to takeoff. I couldn’t hear anything, couldn’t see anything, it was just me and my music. There was no impending doom feeling from the gate to the runway. I really enjoyed not knowing anything going on around me.
5.	⁠⁠⁠When I could feel that we were on the runway and speeding up to takeoff, I lifted both feet just a little bit off the floor and really engaged my core. This helped me focus on myself and my body instead of whatever was going on around me. My eyes were still closed, headphones still on. All I was focusing on was my physical body and my music. I honestly barely felt the actual liftoff because my attention was elsewhere, and this has historically been the worst part for me. Also, remember that planes have different speeds for different purposes. I always freaked myself out after takeoff because the engines get quieter, but I think about it like a car going from first gear to second, third, fourth, etc. The pilots need all that engine power to get off the ground, so it only makes sense that once you’re off the ground and climbing, they reduce the power incrementally until you’re at cruising altitude - just like a car going up a hill!
6.	⁠⁠⁠If I found myself still getting nervous after all of this during the ascent, I simply started counting. I think on my first flight, I was still a little antsy so I started counting at takeoff and got to about 450 in my head before I felt comfortable enough to finally open my eyes - and when I did, we were pretty much already at cruising altitude and everything felt very calm.
7.	⁠⁠⁠Mantras. Every time I started to feel a little nervous throughout the entire flight, I told myself that I am safe, flying is the safest mode of transportation in the world, I fully trust the pilots and crew who are much more knowledgeable than me when it comes to flying and that I should not be making judgment calls on if a feeling or sound means safety or danger because I simply am not a pilot. I also repeated to myself that discomfort does not equal danger and that it’s okay to have a weird feeling and dismiss any negative thoughts about those feelings. Once we were at cruising altitude and the crew started serving food and drinks, I kept telling myself that this was “me time” and that this is relaxing - really helped me reframe my perspective on flying.
8.	⁠⁠⁠Distractions. I brought loads of stuff to keep me fully occupied onboard so that I could listen to music, watch movies, read, play games on my phone, etc. Honestly, I got to a point where I was feeling so relaxed that I just sat in my chair and enjoyed the peacefulness of getting to sit with absolutely NOTHING else to do.
9.	⁠⁠⁠Comforting movies. Really makes the time go by fast and there’s nothing better than getting to watch one of your favorite movies growing up or something that just makes you feel really good (I rewatched Ratatouille)
10.	⁠⁠⁠Turbulence. Watch everything you can on the properties of lift and the representation of turbulence as the airline sitting in a bowl of Jell-O. Turbulence means that planes are functioning exactly as designed, every pilot is well equipped to handle turbulence (and expects turbulence), and reframe it as though you’re driving your car down a dirt road. It’s just a dirt road! Honestly the turbulence became very comforting to me after thinking of it this way and started rocking me to sleep mid flight.
11.	⁠⁠⁠When we began descending for landing, I just repeated all of the above (put my noise canceling headphones back on, playlist, got comfortable, closed my eyes, and waited for the plan to land).

I hope this helps. Much of this has already been said but I can’t believe how effective all of this was for me. I truly feel like I could fly again no problem, which is really awesome.

Remember that you have to get out of your own mind when these anxious thoughts start happening. You don’t HAVE to know everything that is going on, every noise, every feeling. You think that knowing everything going on around you will make you feel better because that’s what anxiety tells you, but in reality it only fuels your thoughts. You begin thinking that you’re seeing “signs” or your brain latches onto a little bump or a little noise and starts exploding with all these crazy ideas that make you feel like you’re in immediate danger. Try your best to tune all of that out, even if it means putting yourself in a quasi sensory deprivation tank in your airplane chair

Some of these strategies will require you to force yourself out of your own mind, but I promise it’s worth it. There were many moments during takeoff where I wanted to open my eyes to look around or take my headphones off to listen, but I knew that if I did that, I was only fueling the anxiety fire in my head. If I felt something weird, my mind immediately wanted to start spiraling into all these different theories, and I had to force myself to remember that I am not a pilot, I have no idea how these aircrafts work, and I trust that they know what they’re doing better than me.

Put your trust in the highly qualified pilots in the cockpit that know what they are doing and the billion dollar aircraft you’re in that was built from the ground up with nothing but safety and comfort for you in mind. Listen to some good music, get cozy, maybe have some glasses of wine onboard if that’s your thing, and ENJOY the ride!

Edit: one more thing I remembered, before the flight I went on one of those flight tracker websites and just observed how many planes were in the sky. Chances are that your flight is one of hundreds or thousands, and all of those people on all of those different aircrafts and all of those different airlines, pilots, crew, etc. will land safely - so you will too! I think we forget just how many planes fly every single day. This was very comforting to me.",7,1765639940.0,fearofflying,1,1.0,False

I am a new coffee shop owner. The sale came with a store manager and full staff. I want to do everything I can to help my store manager train the employees properly,  streamline processes like closing procedures, and implement real accountability when things don't get done.  
The issue is that the store manager acts like a martry-running around town for supplies, working shifts to cover for inept employees, and posting general instructions on the group chat rather than addressing the employees when they mess up-then acting sooo exhausted, but still coming in on her days off even when we've told her not to. 
I am trying my best to be patient and give grace as this has been a big transition for everyone, so I would like to know what your strategies are to make your store manager feel empowered enough to just do the job and see how simplifying things (like ordering multiple days worth of supplies rather than running to the grocery store 5 times in one day when milk runs out-true story) can make her life so much easier.

But she kept completing surgeries.,"She looked like Gwyneth Paltrow or Marie Claire, maybe Katherine Heigl. I’m an L.P.N, a licensed practical nurse and I’ve been following around Dr. Lurra Collodi, the hospital's Head of Neuro Surgery lately. She was 6 '2, her skin as reflective as a doll's with enough elasticity, viscosity, and density to fit the void between memory foam and latex. Silky hair that's so fine, when I close my eyes it’s like wind passing me by. She has a butterfly tattoo on her left hip, right under where the Pelvis shows. And when I open my eyes again I see those, blue eyes.

In the summer before med school, I got restless and fearful of losing the education that I’d one day trade in for a more valuable reputation. Giving up my idle hands for the summer, I wait for the bus trying not to be too concise of the BO, standing across from an old lady. Getting to the hospital I change out of my pajamas for a quick shower, and get ready to finally see Lurra. It’s a long and tedious, not to mention restless process to fix someone's brain stem, and it should be. Grab a BA to get required prerecs, then take the MCAT and hope, if you haven't done enough already, to get accepted into Med school. After that it’s still a decade before I get any recognition for my long standing rejection of rest. I dodge the doctors in charge of giving me tasks, check the new pounds of flesh on clipboards and do my rounds. All day I stress over my own shortcomings while trying to make a lasting impression on the doctor who’s capable of giving me everything I want. I could rest lying on a lazy boy sitting in my den under my millennial gray mansion. When I first saw Lurra I knew that ideal wasn’t far off.

After a clever diversion triggered by an accomplishing coffee machine, I search for cases with a certain desirable staff member. Like an addict that only remembers the high, I pull the chart, avoiding eyes, slipping away and reconvening at the room, not even processing the time spent. Today I’m warming up with the failing respiratory system of a little kid, noticing Dr. Collodi walking by, I patiently wait for her to eventually find me. In the meantime I prepare for overbearing, worried parents bound to the girl whose pain is reason enough to rip anything apart. Keeping these dogs caged is some of the most rewarding work of the day. Silence before and as the door swings open, I come into sight and this time I hear nothing. 

Light dances within silicon tubes, working to assist the girl who’d been rendered an automaton with the most impressive function one could have. Clicks propelled and wholly dependent on the heart beats they’re mixed with, for they would surely cease in tandem. Painful series of sinuous strings, attempting to play something they’re incapable of remembering with every artificial breath. I hear pitiful drops brewing with a pungent odor in sharp contrast with the sterile hospital room. The clothes of the little girl are on a singular padded chair. Letting the door go, light catches the bedazzled pants and, for the benefit of us both, relieves me from the sight for a moment. I come back to find an encircling floral pattern of different colors, like members of an invisible college waiting to feast upon her remnants of life, they wait. I take my place beside them.

Reading the chart I remind myself, this girl had a stroke at just thirteen years old. She had, Has a heart complication that limits the oxygen she’s able to receive to her brain. A mistake made by an attendee with the dosage led to a spike in her blood pressure which created the right conditions for the stroke to take place. Poor pathetic thing, Dr.Collodi planned to fix this diversion which may not change anything, but it’ll help things from getting worse. And she’s going to let me watch. As kids we’re these things of almost infinite potential wasted on our own needs and the never ending quest to end them, and by virtue we rise above it all. After being born into this paradoxical existence, we owe it to ourselves to continue to fall while spinning towards a better landing. I really do have pity for this girl, whose spiral has landed her in our halls. Dr. Collodi walked in with one of the patient's parents.  

“Good morning Dr. Cole.” I say maybe too fast.

Noticing me with a glance, she stops mid sentence to reply. “Good morning, This is Emily’s mother. I was just going over the plan for this afternoon again. She's understandably hesitant but we’re ready, right?”

The parent lifts her chin up not quite meeting my stare. “I uhm. Yeah you know, what else would we be doing here. You know?”

“We’re going to do everything we can.” Words roll forth and out before I can make them sound nice. “I-I’m in the process of becoming a doctor myself, I’ll be assisting Dr.Collodi with Emily’s procedure.” putting everything together as I speak.

Their eyes meet and Collodi clarifies. “He’s just going to be assisting with sterilization and post op procedures.""

“Oh, well thank you for your help then”. 

“Alright, just give us some time to prepare and check up on some of our other patients.”

Dr.Collodi quickly wraps up while I’m already making my way out, Lurra follows. We move down the hall towards an elevator hub.  

NURSE AND LURRA WALK AND TALK, REFERENCE A DATE AND EMOTIONAL STUFF FOR HER. LURRA HAS A WEIRD SOUNDING GURGLY COUGH:).
“If you're going to be a doctor, you’re going to need to learn how to keep patients comfortable”. Dropping all warmth reserved for the patient.

“Well I needed a moment to process.” 

“Still your responsibility. I might have you sit with her during the surgery to learn something.”

“I’m sorry ma’am” Feeling the words escape my lungs, as if the silence sustained a vacuum. “I’ll make sure to- add it to my approach in the future.”

For the first time I let the business of the hospital seep into my consciousness. Different shades of beige punctuating slides of blue lined with white, following more lines of blue, beige, all lined with white. A frantic scramble of bees in a perpetual state of panic. These people are supposed to mend yet for our entire lives, or at least the decade it takes to get here keeps us under exponential stress. You'd think she’d be more caring.

She places her hand on her face. “I finished a five hour surgery, I’m gonna take a nap before the surgery.” It’s like she could say anything she wants. She pulls us to the side and calls the elevator. “Later I’ll need you to take over my rounds when I get off later tonight.” Hand falling to her side, her eyes snap up to catch me with a look. 

“Hey, I can count on you today, right.”

“Yeah of course-”

We're cutting people up and calling it progress. Even still, obvious results are obvious. But with the need to get consent for our work from any man made system, we have to take on all the unfortunate responsibilities that the system can’t handle. All this to say, there are some things nature can’t filter out.

I’ve lost out on so many out of circuit patients. Full families refusing treatment based on the out-of-pocket charges. 

“It’s hectic around here. It’s hard to just be sometimes. I’ve been trying meditation, sound bathing, connecting with nature, and all that bullshit. It doesn't work. The only thing I know is that when I’m carving a tumor out of a brain, or doing a retro-sigmoid craniotomy is when I can think without forcing it.” 

Tilted head and mouth just ajar, I catch her glance from the side. Falling in the depths of those eyes, they’re enough to demand warmth from me. Like solar flares going off in her irises, light dances. The enveloping cornea that pulls me in like the oppressive damp air of a morgue. How does she look so helpless after demonstrating again and again how much I rely on her. Looking at me like I’m just as far along as she is, every leap of faith with the watching expectation of a parent waiting for the first steps. Every step, she expects me to answer before her.

“I don’t know.” I say cliching my shirt.

“I didn’t ask anything.”

“Weren’t you?” 

“Yeah. So I got this thing tonight and it’s really important that my patients are in good hands. My friend and her partner are bringing their roommate over. Kinda an unofficial blind date.”

“Oh I didn’t know you were.” My hand moves up the brail painted across my back.”-Off. Tonight.”

“I told you” 

“Oh yeah, I uhh. Sorry the coffee is taking a minute.”

“I need you to focus. Get the rounds done and come wake me up in two hours, wake me up if any families come in or if a patient gets too loud.”

“Alright, Have a good nap- I guess.”

The elevator opens up, demanding Lurra away. She blazes through her instructions one more time before asking a question as the doors close. Finally waking up I ground myself in the context of the here and now. 

A rhythmic click accompanies me as I make my way down the hall.

Tub dub, tub dub.

I met Dr. Collodi and decided to pivot my practice to focus more on neuro. Specifically the brain stem, weird bird shaped thing, it’s pretty common knowledge that people can live a few seconds after it’s severed. I say knowledge, I actually know nothing about the moment when someone becomes brain dead, they're kinda just dead. We care about the general time people die, and if they stay dead, that’s kinda where the “care” for detail ends. I thought that choosing something out of her area of competition would give me the chance to better assist her, allow me to keep her as a fixture in my life. I’m constantly disappointed by the immaturity I found in my friend groups, but there’s not a moment where she doesn't shatter that illusion. It’s not like I care what I do surgery on anyway but the brain stem, It turns out to be one of my favorite parts. It goes down the whole spine, it’s like the Airport communications tower for the mind.

Making my way down the list of patients to check off,  I check on all the high maintenance cases first then leave the rest for the nurses they know. Leaving, I turn into an open floor plan that spans the length of the building. Tall windows with a ravine-like split joining the five floors, separating the sixth, used as a kind of rudimentary lobby for the helipad. No one actually expects to get service, it’s just for processing, still didn’t stop the architect from making it function like that. To make up for the unused space we filled it with bunks and called it extra sleeping space. Food courts line the first floor, making a V shaped island on the second we use to separate the families just getting in and the ones waiting for patients who are being seen. The rest are a mix of supply closets and rooms, the main storage is a sideways warehouse used to get supplies to all floors from the back wall. This is navigated by a freight elevator next to the only staircase, no one expects me to use it, still I use it to meet Lurra on the sixth floor. 

The elevator doors open and I walk out on to the sixth floor, I’m blinded by the sickening fluorescent lights. Stepping into a shell of a lobby lit only by the glow of white shades keeping light on a border. I find a lone coffee machine, set up against a pillar near the center of the room. I started the second pot of coffee for today. The second the machine starts I hear a harmonization behind me, not an echo or reverberation, or whatever. An independent, loud click followed by air escaping, something. Turning, attempting to meet the sound I find myself disorientated. Gaining my balance the sound is violently interrupted by a door slamming.

There’s doctors sleeping, using the bathroom on this floor. Still trying to quell this internal stew, and convincing myself it’s just the coffee I take a seat closer to the pot. The sound picks up again, it almost plays a tune as its rhythm speeds up. Coffee starts filling the pot and my head is spinning, at the same time gurgling rises betwixt the clicks and violent explosion of air. Anxiety, a lump in my chest perpetuated by the sound of death, I sit and covet my hands in each other. The coffee stops purring and the sound remains, then I finally become aware of eyes watching me.

Now aware of how still I’d become, I found it that much harder to maintain as such. The noise disappears once again with a hiss, after a beat of patient listening I stand up. Crossing from the center of the room to a distant wall I pull my resolve together remembering the surgery, and the reality that this is an un-used portation of an otherwise occupied hospital. Ignoring oddly organic sounds I look for Lurra, stepping behind the desk I walk along it into a back room where we keep the bunks. I find it to be empty, light spilling out from under a side door leading to the bathroom. 

“Lurra?” I push out.

After a long moment I hear “Hello?”

Dr. Lurra Collodi who had a date tonight, who sounds deflated .

“Hello?” I replied. “Dr.Collodi, are you in there?”

“Yeah, I’m just brushing my teeth.”

I take a seat on a nearby bed. I lay on my back and catch my breath. 

“This is some stressful work isn't it.”

“... -I don’t know.”

“This is good work, it’s double the pay I’m used to so there’s no issues there but-... When I get home from work I don’t really do anything, other than work and school there’s not a lot to do but personal work.” Just being here changes your perceptions. Everyday I see the exact results of carelessness, that being said anything not immediately life threatening seems so distant. “I want to keep doing this, I will.” stability without end, this job provides an extreme amount of stability for what. “I just also wonder if this is worth it in the long run. What's the incentive, you know?” A drowning echo fills the room, gurgling, sticky and crackling sounds erupt from the bathroom. Violent implosions followed by relieved exhales, labored all the way through, it’s almost impossible to tell when the vomiting started. I hear wet slaps before what must have been full cups of water being emptied on the linoleum. This takes place in the span of a few seconds before just as abruptly stopping. 

After a moment from the bathroom I hear.“Hey, could I ask you for something” 

I respond by standing up and confusingly saying. “Of course.""

“Could you go out into the supply closet, call a service ticket for the hospital custodians and bring back an out of order sign.”

“Why”

Being left with no response I just stand there, I wait for this hurried odder. Something rotten and wet. In silence I leave towards a separate back room where supplies are kept, is she okay? Coming back with an out of order sign and wet wipes, I’m met with Lurra sitting in a new pair of scrubs. 

“Oh, there you are. Are you ready for the surgery?”

“Yeah, are you?”

“Yeah of course.”

I furrow my brow. “Okay… I mean, are you okay? What just happened in there?”

She looks at me expectantly, shade shrouding the details of her face. “Getting ready for the surgery. You know.” Breaking our gaze she looks towards the bathroom. “Can you put that sign up please.”

Stepping up to the door I see it’s not quite closed but not enough so I could see inside. I look back to find Lurra’s gone, at the same time I hear a door close. She stood up and left without disturbing me, I debated investigating the bathroom. Pushing the sign against the door I open it just ajar, it’s dark but light reflects off a liquid on the ground. Accompanied by a truly horrid smell, spoiled food and perfume. I pull the door shut as I finish with the sign. 

I step out and immediately get scooped up by Lurra, asking me to follow and quicking making her way to the elevator. She’s already waiting in the car before I could stop, we’re moving down and like that we’re off. 

Doors close and we start moving down to the first floor, the lights are soft fluorescents, probably about to go out. No music, no particularly ear catching sounds, just the elevator. Lurra stands facing head on, trying to keep my eyes to myself. I go over the little girls chart again. After surgery it won’t be long till Lurra has that date, a blind date, is there really no one else she’d rather see? Letting my arms fall I catch a glance of Lurra before turning away.

“Hey Lurra?” I turn to meet her gaze immediately.

“Yes?” Her blue eyes, like a diagram of what I remember, I fall deep again. Superficial depth, like all focus had disappeared, for a moment I question if she’s sterling through me. Glossy, like light, resisted it. 

“That blind date. Is there-”

“I’m not going out anymore.”

“Wha- why?”

“I’ll be too busy, I have surgeries to do.”

“Well if your schedule is open again it would be cool to hang out.”

“I’ll need to check, I have surgeries to do.”

The abrupt nature of the statement, and her turn away put an unpleasant end to our conversation. Sitting in the silence I noticed a smell creep into the car, the morgue sits right beside the elevator in the basement so the smell of death wasn’t uncommon on the first or basement level. I look up and see we’re just on the third, the noise from a bit ago reenter my mind. The dry start, getting wetter, more labored, almost breathing noise.

I turn to look at Lurra again. “What happened in the bathroom up there”

She stands ignoring the statement, if it wasn’t for the lingering silence I’d question if she’d heard me at all. She just stood there, the doors open a few minutes of silence later. Without acknowledging me she steps out and towards the O.R. 


Trailing her we step into the pre-op room where we get ready to enter the O.R. Entering we find the girl laying on her side. Already put under and with sterile surgical drapes all around her, a post-op nurse is finishing on a square just behind the girl's right ear. They shaved then wiped away any stray hairs before sterilizing the spot, then they step away to make room for Lurra. Like a conductor taking a seat upon their perch, I’m instructed to hand Dr.Collodi a scalpel. She makes a door the size of the bald spot, then demands a drill before opening it up and removing a portion of the skull. Saving the fragment I hand her over special tools meant to remove the part of the brain that had seized up, hopefully over time this cavity will be filled. At which point the girl can start to learn what she forgot. 

Lurra looks upon the patch of exposed brain for a moment before inserting the tools. Confidently maneuvering them with a camera we start the process of finding the problem area. This typically takes an hour, Lurra was able to find it in fifteen minutes. This isn’t unheard of, of course, we’re looking for something, luckily we found it right out the gates. Still Lurra had an almost knowing confidence. Finding it with the camera, she grounds that then goes in with two long metallic chopsticks. Bony instruments with praying mantis like fillangies meant to slice and grab. She gently cuts around the problemed mass while lightly pulling at it with the other tool, pulling it inside the tube. For thirty quick minutes I watch as Collodi carves at the purpeling mass, in this time things had become pretty somber in preparation for the next big hurdle. While others are preparing I watch as things become unsettling still. The mass is still moving on the camera which is only able to capture a very obstructed view, but the mass seems almost out of sync with Lurra's movements to me. 

I watch closer and see that Dr.Collodie has stuck the instrument a full inch deeper than it should be, drastically uneven with the paring tool. I raise my eyes to Lurras to find hers already sterling into mine. 

“Excuse me, could you go get the parent. We’re almost done here, you're no longer needed, the other nurses will help with the post-op.”

“I- are-”

“Nurse, please go get this patient's parents.” 

Feeling the weight of the room's focus I move. Leaving towards the lobby being left with an unnerving feeling that I was being watched. Arriving at the front desk I’m informed that the mother had a personal emergency involving her other child and the grandmother. Details quickly fleeting from my attention I head back to pass on the information. Once I began to scrub in I realized that there’s no need, the O.R. was empty. Leaving confused, Lurra meets me. 

“Hey, where’s Emily”

Without letting her expression fall she says. “The girl passed.” eyes on the ground with a plastic expression. 

“Wh-How?”

“Soon after you left and during post-op she passed. They're going to do the autopsy in the morning but we don’t exactly know how.”

“Oh so what now?”

“Where’s the mother”

“She’s not here, she had to help her mother.” 

“I’ll need to inform the front desk” She starts heading off where I’d just come from.

“Dr.Collodi.” I announce. 

She stops and turns to face me.

“Do you think I could be a doctor, one day?”

All along she’d carried this plastered look on her face, but finally looking to her for real reassurance, I realized how unusual it was. She kept up this poker face, seeming to think about the question. But when she opened her mouth all I heard was that mucus filled gurgle, that inverted gasp for air, a twirling of saliva with every breath, like the most disturbing bird she sings this involuntary song. Like a siren's song decreasing the space between us, I freeze as her legs laboriously carry her ever closer. 

The uncanny behavior and the intensifying urgency of the situation, without thinking for a moment more, I turn and run. I run down the hall, hearing Lurra quickly behind me. Through the farthest door into the stairwell, I slam my body against the door Lurra pushes from the other side. Without too long to think I plan on finding an exit from the basement level, Lurra incrouches a few inches. I jump from the door and down the stairs, landing on the first landing before the basement floor I look up. The door has swung open and slammed an echo throughout the chamber, She stands in the doorway watching me. Not wanting to see what happens next, I quickly make my way down the stairs and into the basement hall. 

Adjusting to the cool air I collect myself. Debating whether or not I can leave I find that I don’t care, if anyone asks me about it I’ll refer them to security for verification. The closest exit is through the morgue right across from me, hospital morgues need to have some kinda public access so the families can retrieve their other family members. I step into the morgue, damp cool air, bodies awaiting autopsies line the freezer wall. A singular path of light leads to the middle of the room and past that I see the exit sign up a flight of stairs. Each step taken makes it tougher to ignore the void left by the obvious company unable to keep it. 

Arriving then eventually passing the last light I began to hear and try to rationalize the noise I know too well at this point. Behind me I hear the late death rattle of a body along the left wall, at first muffled before the rising and falling of sheets freed it. Turning my head to look over my left shoulder, in the corner of my eye I see the little girl looking at me. Mouth agape, foul echos resonating from her. We stand locked in each other's gaze as her breath picks up and drops again, with every cycle a single word becomes clearer. 

“no. no No. No No No, NOo NOo Noo.”

I leap from my frozen position, across the unlit floor, kicking plastic containers. Up the staircase and through the door before a foot could catch the last step, I slammed the door. 

Embraced by the evening air, looking across the parking lot the sun rests just under the city's skyline. Walking briskly to the bus stop looking over my shoulder, a question pierces through every thought I could manage.

The coffee in the picture smells absolutely amazing. The first cup I brewed was incredible; bright, fruity, little tart, and overall delicious. It was just a hair weak for my liking, so I've tried to get it a bit stronger. However, I can't seem to get there. I've tried just going back to the original approach and I can't seem to repeat that first cup anymore, despite logging the parameters I used (grind size, mass, water temp). I feel like there's some other variable at play that I'm not accounting for, because I try to keep everything fixed and yet I get different results. 

I've tried grinding finer, coarser, more coffee:water, less coffee:water, just tried both finer grind and more water, and it's still so flat.

TIME. I don't know how to describe it but I'll do my best. I am constantly fatigued, sometimes headachy, zero energy, with a general queasiness but not nauseated. 

I struggle getting through workdays. The one good thing about the pandemic was remote work. That really helped me get through a day. I then took a new job requiring me to go into the office once a week (a 100 mile round trip commute), and we just received notice that starting mid-January we will be required to be in office Tues-Thurs. I'm sure full return will follow down the road. As it is, I get out of bed close to 2 hours early just so I can sit with coffee, the news, and scrolling the website to prepare myself to get in the shower and start moving. 

Regardless of whether or not I have to wake up for work or can sleep in on a weekend, I have to sit for hours before I can work up the energy to move. Doesn't matter if it's 6 hours, 8, 10, or 12 hours. I just don't feel well ever. 

I push myself to get done what needs to be done, housecleaning, cooking, laundry, pet care, working, showering, etc. I shop almost solely online including grocery delivery. My husband and I usually go out on Friday nights for a few drinks to see friends at our local American Legion. And I do look forward to that, but I am completely wiped out for the remainder of the weekend. 

My mind wants to do things, I miss my old hobbies, I miss having the energy to do things, anything. I miss feeling well and normal. I hate feeling sick all the time. I used to be active, I exercised daily, I was always doing something, I felt good.

This has been going on for around 13 years. It started with fatigue and has grown into feeling sick all the time about 6 or so years ago. 

I've talked with my doctor to no avail. My blood tests come back normal and she can find nothing wrong in my normal physicals.

History:

White female turning 62 in February. 

Height - 5'5""

Weight - 150 lbs (peri and post-menopausal weight gain of about 20-25 lbs) Never had a regular cycle and often skipped months with no period. 

Depression since childhood, began treatment in 2004. Started on 30mg Cymbalta 3x day. Bumped up to 60mg time release generic (Duloxetine) 1x day when complaining to a previous physician about constant fatigue around 2016.

High blood pressure: Losartan HCTZ 100/25 1x day, Amlodipine Besylate 5mg 1x day, Spironolactone 25mg 1x day. 

My blood pressure is hereditary, started on meds at age 37 at the height of physical peak. Ate healthy, regular exercise, felt great overall. My mom and maternal grandmother also had HBP and treated with meds.

I have a few beers one night a week (when we go out). No recreational drug use. 

I have had pre-cancerous polyps removed during my first colonoscopy 3 years ago. Went for 2nd colonoscopy 6 months ago and am scheduled for another in Feb. I do have loose stools regularly but that could be due to medications. Those issues started approximately 10 years ago. 

Could I have an autoimmune disease or something? What can I do from here? I can't live the rest of my life feeling like crap all the time. 

Thank you for any advice/direction given.

1plnp92,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1plnp92/aitah_for_sex_shaming_the_guy_i_was_seeing/,AITAH for sex shaming the guy I was seeing?,"So, yesterday a friend (28F) came to me (32NB) and told me that something had been bothering her for years, and that she needed to hold me accountable for my behaviour. Essentially, she’s upset because she feels like five years ago I broke up with a guy because of his body count. And because of that, ever since then, she’s felt like she can’t trust me or be honest with me. So she’s bringing this up now because she wants to clear the air and have a better friendship. She wants me to apologize to both her and the guy, but the problem is that I don’t really feel like anyone is owed an apology? And I feel like “breaking up with him because of his body count” is kind of a misunderstanding of what happened.

Basically, I matched with a guy (now 35M, then 30M) on Tinder in October 2019. He told me upfront that he was taking dating very seriously that year and was looking for his life partner. On our first date he basically laid everything on the table (what he was looking for, whether he wanted children, his career goals, his thoughts on managing finances, his medical information, etc. etc.) and said he only wanted to go on a second date if we were compatible. (It sounds very clinical typing it out now, but it felt normal in the moment). He also discussed his dating history, and noted that he had broken up with someone in late March, and had gone on a number of first dates (doing the same thing as he did with me) and that most of the didn’t lead to second dates.

Based on what we talked about, we seemed like a good match, so I agreed to go on a second date with him. But I told him that even though I was also looking for a long term partner, I wasn’t willing to jump into a serious relationship just based on our compatibility on paper, and that I needed time to get to know him. I also told him I wasn’t willing to be intimate with a partner until we were exclusive and both had STI testing. He was very amenable to both of these things, and told me that it was “refreshing to meet someone with the same outlook on dating and sex.” We both stopped dating other people after that first date, but we didn’t agree to be exclusive until about a month and a half later.

(Idk if this is actually needed information. But I feel like I should mention that I worked as a receptionist at a sexual health clinic for several years, so getting STI testing is a hard boundary for me. And one of things we talked about on the first date is how he wants to be child free because he raised his siblings, and how he got a vasectomy at 25.)

In February, we were chatting and he asked me what my “body count” was. This generally isn’t something I bring up with partners because I don’t feel like it’s any of my business. But I was honest and told him 4, I spent most of 20s in committed relationships. He then told me his was somewhere in the 40s. For me, that sounded pretty reasonable given that he was like 30. So I was like, “That’s about 2-4 a year since you were 18, so that seems pretty safe.” (And when I mean safe, I mean like it terms of STIs. We talked on our first date about how I won’t sleep with someone until it’s been three months since their last partner and they’ve been tested because anything less than that could lead to a false-negative test result.)

He got all squirmy and weird, so I asked him what was up. And then he told me the year prior between April and September, he went on over well 100 first dates and had slept with 32 of those people. And ngl, at first I was just confused about the logistics of that and he explained how sometimes he would go on 2-3 dates in one day (usually like one for coffee/lunch, one for dinner, and then meeting one at the pub in the evening.) But ultimately the thing that bothered me was how unsafe that felt. Like you can’t have 32 sexual partners in six months and be 100% sure that you’re not passing infections around. And he knew literally from our first date how important sexual health was to me. I kind of sat on it for a few days, but ultimately I broke up with him. I just felt like I couldn’t trust someone who was that reckless and irresponsible with other people’s health. Especially at 30, I feel like you should definitely know how dangerous STIs are. And tbh I also felt a little deceived because he went on and on during the first date about how “refreshing” it was to meet someone who wanted to take things slow.

But yeah, now my friend wants me to take accountability for my actions, work on not sex-shaming people, and apologize to both him and her for my actions. I did ask her if she felt like anything else I say/do is sex-shamey and she couldn’t think of another example, just the body count thing. But she says she can’t be 100% honest with me about things because of this situation. It also feels weird to reach out to someone after five years to apologize for something, especially when we only dated for a few months? My partner says they don’t have an issue with me reaching out to him, but they’re more concerned I’m being guilted into doing something I don’t want to do.

1plnnb8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1plnnb8,Is there hope for me?,"I’m 27. I unfortunately had braces as a young teenager while my mom was heavily battling opioid addiction issues. I essentially neglected my teeth. In addition, when I was 10-11 years old, I got into a scooter accident and chipped my two front teeth, requiring two root canals on my central incisors.

When I was 22 I got composite veneers put on my front top ten teeth. They were honestly great but I noticed the margins between my central and lateral incisors were growing wider and I could see my teeth underneath the void. I decided to get them redone since it was evidently removable. Well, my dentist removed them on Monday and I had these two large brown spots on my laterals. I panicked, well, I’m still panicking. My dentist is passionate that they are sclerotic dentin and told me he checked before replacing with my current bondings thoroughly. The surface was hard. He believes we should leave them alone and just cover the staining with bonding.

I got two more opinions and both dentists thought they were cavities, one even recommended a root canal and crown… granted both of these dentist were going off of x-rays since I had the bonding back on my teeth.

I’ve had a lot of fillings in my life. Probably half of my teeth have some sort of filing, most are inter-proximal unfortunately. In the last 5 years I think I’ve had 1/2 fillings and I believe a lot of that had to do with acid reflux from two pregnancies.

My dentist tells me often how much better my gums look and that my bone structure is great and my oral health is much improved. But now I have these brown spots and am so unsure of them.

I’ve never had a crown (my root canals were bonded and sealed really well and my dentist always advised against a crown unless we absolutely need to). He’s very conservative.

I brush with sonicare morning and night, floss throughout the day if needed but very though only at night. I’ve switched to just drinking water, no more sugary coffee.

Will my teeth make it to old age like this? What more can I do to ensure this doesn’t progress? All the dentists I see always look at me like they’ve seen way worse and I’m overreacting but I genuinely feel like my teeth are awful.

Currently I have light bonding on the top front 4  and I’m trying to go back to no veneers (composite included) so I can thoroughly see what’s going on with my own teeth.

Photos are of my teeth with most of the old bonding removed. A before photo of what my teeth looks like without anything. And then two recent x-rays of the central and laterals. Last photo I took right now so you can see my natural teeth and the 4 bonded front teeth.

I can’t sleep at night and I’m trembling while writing this. Praying for a miracle and hoping it’s not too late to save my teeth.",1,1765638812.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

Some duplicates to last year (purchased at the tail end of 2024). But nothing duplicated within the calendar year.

Every bean was used to pull a straight black double shot. Usually one shot per day. I can’t recall a specific milk drink, but it’s possible I did a few as a test.

Lots of dialing in, though I am pretty good at it after so many years of switching bean to bean. With the PP300, I’ve found longer (time) doubles work best. I start with an 18g dose, adjust based on headspace + or - 2g, yield at 36. Based on taste I adjust the final ratio and then mess with the time a little.

I usually randomly buy bags from a running list of roasters I like or want to try, buying multiple bags at a time, and sometimes following sale (looking at Perc here).

I press the steam button to continue steaming and it completes the cycle, flashing the same lights again after the automatic purge, so I manually purge the wand again. I keep to a regular cleaning and descaling schedule, doing it before the clean/descale notice pops up. Things I've tried:

1. Removing and cleaning the wand tip. It's spotless, and running the steam cycle with water in the pitcher and the wand tip removed has the same result, anyway. Same when I manually steam, so it's not the tip or the temp sensor. 

2. Soaking the wand with pitcher full of very hot water for a long time, and steaming hot water.

3. Same as 2 but with vinegar (not steaming, just soaking)

4. Extra descale cycle

5. Running just hot water mode for a couple cups, including with descaling solution.

6. Removed the back, removed the line from the sensor to flush with water, cleaned out a bit of gunk in the line (there was very little, not affecting any water flow). The hose looks brand new now.

7. Purging the wand before running the coffee, and before steaming

I contacted Breville but don't expect much because it's two years old. I'm at a loss of what to try now. Water comes out of the steam wand just fine, no sputtering. It's hot. Has anyone tried anything else that worked?",1,1765638313.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

We met when I was 30. I was in the middle of a divorce. Very troubled passionate high and low 6 years relationship. Had slept around plenty before that. Sex was never an issue to me and I was pretty free spirited, and of no jealous nature at all.

She was 27 and only had one serious 2 year relationship when she was 18. Only hookups since then. 12 guys.

She mentioned the threesome straight away. We told everything to each other as neither of us thought we'd be serious at first, eventhough we ""got"" each others from the get go. And eventually we did.

Threesome was with a manager she had for a time and his wife, on the libertine side. They hanged out a lot and one night it happened. She didn't go into details but said it was fun. It didn't bother me.

Then we got more serious, and I realized she was still friend with the couple. And now that did bother me. She got it but kept them on facebook. She said they were friends before anything and hanged out dozens of time without anything happening, only this one time. And I thought/think its the truth cause there was honestly no reason to lie about it when we told each other's our life stories when we met thinking we'd just be a short fling.

I realized she had kind of a people pleaser personality and that completely cutting off people just wasn't in her nature, and I decided it would be harsh of me to force her into it. I still made it clear FB was ok but meeting was not an option.

Then she got pregnant. It wasn't planned, but we strangely both felt ok with it. It changed my perception of her, of me, of everything.

One day I noticed she wished the guy a happy birthday on FB. It awoke something in me. I checked her old mails and chats and realized she'd been talking a lot with the guy at the very beginning of our relationship. Lots of flirty stuff. One in particular definitely cybersex with cams on. It broke something in me. I wanted to end it immediately. But she was pregnant. I grew up without a dad and just couldnt bear the idea of not being there for my own kids. So I confronted her about it. She said it was a one time thing. That she mentioned to him how much she was into me and that it was kind of a farewell thing.

Admittedly we weren't proper dating at the point the cam sex took place, mostly because of me who was still in a divorce at the time. I told her I'd get over it only if she would never be in touch with the guy again, and she said she would.

From that point on sadly, I developed a paranoid obsession. One year later 14 years ago while checking her emails, I saw in her sent messages that she had written to him while visiting her home town. She had deleted the main convo. Convo was really short and simply mentioning coffee but also making a joking reference to their threesome.

Confronted her and after defensive shit about going through her mails she admitted and said she always felt bad about cutting contact with them out of the blue without explaining and that was an attempt to make up for it. Also said they never ended up actually meeting. I believe that one 90% due to analyzing the timeline and the fact the guy's answers were really evasive like he didnt care one bit.

That was 14 years ago.

So much happened in between. 2 kids, a beautiful home, a wedding ... We were blessed in so many ways. But unfortunately the thoughts never left me and even accentuated at times.

I went through obsessive phases of checking her computer, picturing the threesome, picturing her cheating even. This one really hurts to admit but the threesome even became such an obsession that I even ended up developing a weird unhealthy fantasy about it. 20s me would be so ashamed of me. This is not the person I was. I was once a confident, attractive, assertive young guy. I don't know how things turned out that way.

I get periods of peace, but inevitably the creeping thoughts return. Usually when we're at our best. I look at her, a loving mother with our 2 kids, and get sudden flashes of her having wild sex with a married couple.

I got one of those today and checked her computer for the first time in months. Checking her google history, I realized she checks on the guy roughly once a year. The last time was a year ago. Nothing extensive. Just a google search. But imagining what thoughts went through her mind triggered this search is what truly bothers me.

I wish she would help me, but she's not someone who talks about things much, feelings especially. She apologized once and thinks it's enough. When the topic (rarely) creeps up, she says I'm overbuilding things in my head. That it was nothing special. That she never knew truly good sex until we met. That she should be more jealous of my years with my ex-wife.

When she says it, I believe it. But then the thoughts creep in. She lied to you before. They probably did it many times. They had a whole thing going. What with the cam sex with him etc ...

I have clear points to counter all of those. Her account of the event was always consistent from the very first day we met. I checked her whole conversation history with him 14 years ago and it was really just that instance. But still ...

I guess you could ask, what about the other guys she slept with ? Well, the lying linked to the 3some first of all of course. But also ... I don't know there is just something so messed up about thinking about the mother of my children as the unicorn of a libertine couple ... All in all though, I think if things didnt overlap with us I would have been able to get over it. I have a lot of anger about this. I feel like she screwed things between us forever to make this guy feel better. Instead of me.

She's a great mom and spouse otherwise. We have lots in common and are a great parenting team. Our kids are happy.

I know I'll be better tomorrow. But I also know I'll be feeling like this again sooner or later in the future ... I'm so tired of having to fight these demons in my otherwise happy life.

I blame myself for accepting something I couldn't deal with in the end. But I also wouldnt give up all those years with my kids for the world.

So I tell myself we all suffer in life from one thing or another ...",1,1765638278.0,retroactivejealousy,0,1.0,False

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around some tables and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Each week we typically get a mix of regulars, people who drop by occasionally and a few newbies.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

I’m looking for recommendations for barista courses in Boston, preferably short-term and hands-on. I’ll be living in the city in 2026, and this is more of a hobby/personal interest than a professional career move.

I previously took a coffee sommelier course while living in Denver, so I already have some “theoretical” background. This time, I’m mainly interested in something more practical and hands-on, espresso dialing in, milk steaming, workflow, etc.

I’m open to courses offered by coffee schools, specialty cafés, or training labs, as long as they’re welcoming to enthusiasts and not just full professional certifications.

Any suggestions or experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! ",3,1765638157.0,boston,1,0.8,False

Right along with them was a special decaf.  
   
Yes, decaf. Once treated largely as a disappointingly-flavored substitute for regular coffee, it is now gaining a place among the limited hand-drip lineup at cafes — a space usually reserved for carefully-sourced, flavor-driven beans. That's because many decaf coffees are now selected and brewed with the same care and attention as any specialty bean.

“Hand-drip decaf orders come in just as often as our other hand-drip specialties,” a barista said, while finishing the final drip for a decaf brew full of bright acidity.  
   
Decaf is moving into the mainstream in Korea's highly-competitive coffee market. Starbucks Korea reported last month that sales of decaffeinated beverages through October this year reached 36.5 million orders, up 35 percent from the same period last year. One in every eight Americanos sold there was decaf. Even low-cost cafe chain Mega MGC Coffee said it poured 7.5 million cups of decaf during the first half of this year, a roughly 70-percent jump from a year earlier.

The growing demand for decaffeinated coffee in Korea reflects a global shift toward health-conscious consumption, but the pace of growth here is particularly notable. Korea's decaf market is projected to expand at an average annual rate of 8.2 percent between 2024 and 2032, outpacing the global average of 7.1 percent during the same period, according to market tracker Inkwood Research.  
   
And the shift is easy to spot. What was once a quiet request at the counter is now easy to find in cafes of all kinds — with more options for beans with distinctive flavor profiles available, as well as inventive products emerging in step with the broader wellness culture.   
   
   
**Decaf takes the stage**  
   
At this year's Seoul International Cafe Show, where 3,903 brands from 631 companies across 35 countries participated, decaf quietly claimed the spotlight.  
   
“Decaffeinated blend is the second most popular blend from our store,” said Chae Soo-min, a staffer at Hitch Coffee booth, as he handed out samples of its Colombia and Brazilian decaf blends during the exhibition.

Wandering between booths, specialty decaf appeared in every shade of flavor — a roast with citrus, caramel and cocoa; another vivid with orange notes; while another one had nutty and smooth tones. Saroksu Coffee poured an Ethiopian decaf with acacia honey, citron and roasted chestnut.  
   
Many cafe owners — and aspiring ones — attended the event in search of distinctive decaf beans to serve in their cafes, a shift from the days when decaf meant just one or two generic options.  
   
“The supply of specialty decaf is limited,” said a staffer at one booth selling decaf beans. “Specialty coffee beans with their own distinctive profiles are decaffeinated in small batches. Even after the process, those subtle original flavors still remain.”

Some exhibitors focused exclusively on decaf. Beanspacecoffee, which manufactures and distributes only decaffeinated beans, showcased newly released single-pack ground decaf. The packets, CEO Cho Min-ki said at the booth, were created to help small cafes avoid buying an extra grinder just for decaf beans.  
   
“For a regular coffee shop to sell decaffeinated coffee, it needs a grinder just for decaf, because you cannot put decaf beans in, take them all out and then put caffeinated beans back in,” said Cho. “But buying a grinder that costs one or two million won is burdensome. So I came up with packet-style decaf that shops can use without a grinder.”  
   
Cho has also been selling regular decaf beans for three years, and demand, Cho said, has been ballooning. “Our import volume has grown eightfold from three years ago,” Cho said. Mega Coffee is among its largest buyers. “Many companies are currently reaching out to us.”  
   
Coffee beans typically undergo either the Swiss Water Process or the Sugarcane Process to become decaffeinated, but rising demand for decaf has led to the emergence of some creative approaches, such as lowering caffeine levels in the beans through a germination process.  
   


Decaf Coffee Lab's coffee \[DECAF COFFEE LAB\]

   
There is even a roastery dedicated exclusively to decaf beans. “Depending on the coffee bean variety, the origin and how it is roasted, the nuances can vary greatly,” said Im Do-gil, CEO of the decaf-only roastery Deca Coffee Lab. He added market base has expanded over the years from cafes to obstetrics and gynecology clinics, as well as aesthetic facilities.  
   
New techniques are appearing, too. Some producers add aromatic ingredients — spices like cinnamon or cardamom, or vanilla extract — during roasting to create more flavored coffee, called flavored or infused decaf. “For people who enjoy flavored coffee, that’s good,” Im said. “But for coffee enthusiasts, it tends not to be preferred because it masks the original qualities of the coffee.”  
   
The rapid growth of the decaffeinated coffee market is closely tied to changing consumer lifestyles that prioritize well-being. That emphasis in Korea has even led to the emergence of a new product category that sits between coffee and health supplements.  
   


SleePresso \[SLEEPING BOTTLE\]

One example is Sleeping Bottle, which recently launched a product called SleePresso, marketed as “sleep coffee.” It combines decaffeinated cold brew with plant-based ingredients, including barley malt, which is believed to help induce sleep.  
   
“Many people can't drink coffee at night,” said an official from Sleeping Bottle. “So we invented the product for people who want to drink coffee late at night and people sensitive to caffeine can enjoy it comfortably.”  
   
   
**0.1% mandates**   
   
Yet growth has brought scrutiny. Korea's criteria for labeling decaf have been called too loose, prompting the government to tighten them. Currently, coffee with more than 90 percent of its caffeine removed can be labeled decaf, but remaining caffeine levels vary widely.   
   
For example, per 500 milliliters, Mammoth Coffee’s decaf contains 1.9 milligrams of residual caffeine, Mega Coffee’s has 7.6 milligrams, Compose Coffee’s has 10.2 milligrams and Starbucks has 14.1 milligrams. These varying levels aroused some complaints from consumers, including reports of heart palpitations, sleep disturbances and other side effects.  
   


An official from the Busan Consumer Organizations Council explains the test results and consumer perception survey regarding the safety, labeling and caffeine content of 15 decaffeinated capsule coffee products sold on the market on March 6. \[NEWS1\]

In November, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety announced it would establish clearer standards. Beginning next March, only coffee with less than 0.1 percent residual caffeine after removal may be labeled decaffeinated.  
   
Many companies, however, said they already meet that threshold. Bean Space said, “Ours contains only 0.014 percent,” while a Sleeping Bottle official said based on beans alone, “99.9 percent of caffeine is already removed, and for the finished product — which includes water — the level is even lower.”  
   
Deca Coffee Lab — whose products already have 99.9 percent of their caffeine removed — welcomed the change.  
   
“The current European standard required that more than 99 percent of caffeine be removed to classify a product as decaf, but Korea's standards were looser at 90 percent,” said Deca Coffee Lab's Im. “People who drink decaf usually do so because they are very sensitive to caffeine and want to avoid it, but under Korea's previous rules, it was difficult to avoid caffeine completely even when ordering decaf. So I think it's a good thing that the standard has been raised to match international norms.”

I’ve never had one before, I’ve always woken up, made coffee, paired it with a cigarette and gotten out of the door running on pure spite and an aderoll prescription for my ADHD. 

My whole life fell apart…again, lol. I’m in a completely new job with a completely different schedule. I’m so tired and way too old for this shit, I’m *trying* to be a better person and better to myself this time. 

I’ve recently quit smoking and getting out of bed in the morning has been hard without my go to wake up routing for 17 years. Recently, I’ve been leaving chocolate out by my bedside like I’m the Easter Bunny and it’s been working🤓


I drag myself out of bed to make breakfast. I’ve told myself I want to start eating more ‘whole foods’ and not processed microwaved sandwiches. So I make eggs, with spinach, tomatoes, onions, and cheese on the top. I made that everyday doze coffee instead of having real coffee. I’ve tried to work this as a substitute so I’m not triggered to smoke a cigarette.

I pack my snacks and lunch for my new monotonous job, brush my teeth and I make myself floss now too. (I literally can’t afford to pay for another root canal lol) I try to wash my face but sometimes I worry about if I’ll have enough time and if my pores will still be open by the time I go outside in the cold. Sometimes I skip washing my face sometimes I make time for it. I feel bad when I skip it but I take the bus now, I think I’d be more mad if I missed the bus in this winter weather and had to walk. It all depends on if I can get out of bed when I first set my alarm or not. 

Then I make my bed. I’ve never made my bed before but it’s supposed to be good for you and it is nice seeing it all neat when I get home from work. 

I’ve started morning yoga! I always imagined myself waking up and doing yoga in the morning. It’s only 10mins but the practice is effective I like it. My back feels so much more open!

I wanted to make time for ‘the daily practice’ that’s in the book ‘reregulated’ by Anna Runkle, has anyone read that book? I never have enough time for it. This is the first time I’ve woken up so early in my life aside from elementary school. (Even in middle and highschool I would put my study halls in the morning so I could go to school later in the day) sometimes if I have energy I can squeeze it in, most days I don’t. 

I throw on my clothes I picked out the night before for work and head to the bus stop. Tada morning routine done.

It takes me two hours to complete this simple process and then I get mad at myself when I miss the face washing and the daily practice but I’m hoping it will get better with practice. 

What’s your morning routine like? I’m curious to know others and what works for them!",6,1765637796.0,CPTSD,2,1.0,False

this one goes back to 2023 where we wanted to implement Coffee Chats in an organization to better connect people with each other. The obvious choice back then was to just use a solution inside of Slack as everyone was already on there.   
So we tried a bunch of apps.

They technically worked, but always felt overcomplicated and often not fitting our use case. Hard to opt out, too many settings, kinda forced. Especially the opt-out was a hell as people who didn't want to get matched, typically did end up in matches, ruining the experience for everyone.

So I hacked together a super simple Slack bot for our own workspace instead.

It just let people react to a bot-message in a defined channel with an emoji the bot also used on the message and the paired upon second invoking.

It sat as an internal tool for a while, and I recently made it production-ready-ish so other teams can try it. It’s called Coffee Pot and it’s totally free.

**What it does:**

* Matches teammates into small groups
* Lets people opt in via emoji, button-click or auto-include of a whole channel
* Ensures different pairings each round
* Creates a private Slack chat for the Groups with optionally a suggested icebreaker

**It's completely free to use,** honestly I would love to see if it really works for other teams as well as it did for ours.  
You can try it from here: [https://flowifyapps.com/slack-coffee-pot](https://flowifyapps.com/slack-coffee-pot)



Even if you don't try it, I would love to know:

* Does this problem resonate with you?
* How to integrate such internal tools so that they don't feel forced?
* What do you think such a tool needs to fit in your organization/team?

Or  
Parker's Ladder  

## Chapter One

The unforgiving Alabama sun beamed down on Highway 12, making the asphalt hot enough to fry bacon.

Pine thickets stretched through the Piedmont and lined on either side of the road. The humidity was suffocating like a steamed towel to the face making every breath more difficult than the last. For thirteen year old Parker Ellis, the new kid from Indiana, this summer felt like an exile in the desert, torturous compared to the milder Midwestern weather.

The yellow house on County Road 8, his new home with his mom, April, was a musty smelling husk of slumped support beams and peeling floral wallpaper. The porch, windows and attic all creaked at night as if the place was haunted.

Parker's mom referred to the move as a ""fresh start"" after his father left. Parker didn't see it that way. His friends he'd known since first grade were nearly 500 miles away, because his parents couldn't fix their problems, or perhaps because Parker's detention antics had pushed them over the edge.

His father got to stay in Terre Haute, in a nice condo apartment, while his mother ""escaped"" to Anniston, Alabama, dragging Parker along with little more than a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles suitcase. He spent his first week exploring a half-acre vacant lot, swatting mosquitos and pulling dandelions. School didn't start for several weeks, so the days dragged on, lonely and boring. His mom worked 12-16 hour shifts at Anniston Memorial and would leave pizza pockets and popcorn for him on the way out the door to work. A huge empty house filled with loneliness. In desperation, he reached out to his friends back home but gave up after several unanswered AIM messages.

On the eighth day of isolation, Isaac showed up.

Parker sat on his front porch, whittling down a discarded stick into a spear. He theorized that it would be easier to eat marshmallows, but he was curious if his mom would mind a fire in the backyard. He was lost in his thoughts when a bicycle stopped at the end of the driveway. A boy who appeared to be around his age leaned on the handlebars, thin and tanned by the sun, his long black hair falling into his eyes.

His face held a playful smirk like he was hiding a secret.

""Haven't seen you around here before."" The boy in the faded cartoon shark T-shirt called out. Parker answered without looking up. ""Just moved here a week ago.""

""You gonna whittle all day or you got plans for something fun?""

Parker stopped and looked up, knife still in hand. Nobody had spoken two words to him since three days ago at the gas station when the cashier mumbled his order total. 

And he had only seen a handful of other kids outside at all.

He narrowed his eyes intently at the kid, incredulous this could be malicious. ""Who are you?"" 

""Isaac Boone. I live up the road that way,"" He turned and pointed right toward the driveway. ""Saw you by yourself and figured you were someone worth knowing."" Isaac tossed his bike into the gravel and walked up to the porch.

He plopped down on the ground next to Parker. He smelled strongly of sweat, pine leaves, and pennies.

Parker shrugged and continued his whittling, not sure what to say to the kid.

Isaac wasn't bothered. He leaned back on the fence and stretched his legs until he decided to talk again.

""So, you ever been in a scrap?""

""Huh?""

""You know, a tussle. A fight. Black eyes, broken teeth, blood?"" Parker shook his head honestly as his stomach tightened. The only fight he'd ever been in involved water balloons, and was completely by accident.

""What about you?""

Isaac's cryptic smile stretched wide. ""Once or twice. Nothing big. Just stupid kid stuff. You could probably hold your own in one, though. You got that look like you're constantly overthinking.""

Parker wasn't sure if he just been insulted or complimented.

He chose to believe the latter. He hardly ever got praise among his Terre Haute friends. He began twirling his now finished spear just to have something to do with his hands.

""So, what's there to do around here?""

Isaac's eyes beamed with possibilities. 
""There's plenty, if you're not scared. Creek has catfish. The old mill down Highway 12, people go exploring in there. And the Quarry, teenagers sneak in and jump off the cliffs into the water.""

Parker hesitated. ""Kids back home don't do stuff like that.""

The quarry sounded like a broken leg waiting to happen, the mill reminded him of a horror movie he saw way too young about it being a hideout for serial killers. The creek seemed the most manageable and made him much less of a coward.

""Okay, maybe the creek."" Isaac slapped his knee and snorted.

""Good enough. I'll show you around."" They spent the afternoon tossing rocks in the water and wading in up to their ankles. Isaac talked a mile a minute about how he wrestled a twenty pound catfish barehanded last summer. Parker feigned being impressed with what he was sure was a tall tale but this was still the most fun he'd had in Alabama so far.

Being around Isaac felt like being in a storm exciting and risky, but truly alive.

The two headed to Parker's house as the setting sun cast gold and pink across the sky. Their sneakers squelched with every step and Parker's legs were covered in thicket scratches and mosquito bites, but he was happy.

They collapsed onto the porch and Parker went inside and brought back two room temperature colas.

""You're all right, Parker."" Isaac said after taking a sip.

""Thanks,"" Parker said, a shy smile slowly overtaking his lips.

""You're not terrible, either,""

Isaac tilted his head and studied Parker for a moment.

""You ever had a best friend before? A real one?""

Parker thought about his friends back in Indiana. The ones he'd spent hours building blanket forts and riding bikes with until dark. At his going away party, they all agreed to keep in touch, but Parker's inbox with no new messages proved that a lie.

""Back home, sure,"" he said softly. ""But not here.""

Isaac nodded, then his grin returned even brighter than before.

""You and me, we could be best friends. But, we gotta do it right.""

Parker raised an eyebrow playfully in curiosity.

""How?""

""A Friendship Ladder,"" Isaac voice beginning to brim with mischief.

""Ten rungs, challenges we have to do together. Once we get to Level Ten: Best Friends. No shortcuts. No quiting. You in?""

Parker stared at the soda can in his hand.

It seemed absurd at first, like some forced activity at summer camp, but Isaac's energy and enthusiasm was contagious. The thought of having at least one friend when school started seemed like an advantage.

""What kind of challenges?"" he asked.

""Anything we want,"" Isaac said. ""We can make it up as we go along. As long as we do every step together.""

Parker paused but the hopeful light in Isaac's eyes sealed it.

He reached out his hand. ""I'm in."" Isaac shook it with a strong, forceful grip. 

""Step one's tomorrow. Be ready.""

As Isaac pedaled out of Parker's driveway and into the fading light. Parker leaned against the front door on the porch until he was out of sight.

The summer night loomed, hot as ever, but it no longer felt like exile.

It felt more like a ladder and he was about to take the first step.

## Chapter 2

Parker tossed a blanket into the corner of the room. His heart startled for a second as Isaac tossed his backpack on the carpet a few feet away.

The old house groaned and creaked as usual, causing Parker to glance at the door every few minutes half expecting his mom to barge in.

She seemed indifferent to having a guest overnight when he asked but Parker chalked it up to her busy schedule. He hoped Isaac and his mom would get along. ""This place is like a mansion,"" Isaac said while belly flopping onto Parker's bed.

His eyes curiously scanned the room.

""Do the ghosts show up after midnight or before?"" He joked and made ghost noises making Parker laugh out loud.

""Nah, nothing like that. My mom got it for cheap because it's old."" Parker slid a pile of comics under his bed. He didn't want to come across as the dorky kid from Indiana.

""We can't be too loud after 10."" Isaac shrugged and grabbed a bag of chips from his backpack.

""No sweat. My folks act weird sometimes, too. You want some of these?""

He threw the bag in Parker's direction. They sat crunching chips and talking.

Parker talked about the time he tried to build a model rocket in the backyard that launched and immediately caught on fire. Isaac cackled and followed up with how he pranked his Algebra teacher by pouring cayenne pepper in his coffee.

""Man, you're fearless,"" Parker said, shaking his head. He envied Isaac's boldness. ""Nah, asymptotes are just really boring."" Isaac's smile faded briefly, then he changed the subject to something else.

""Got any games?"" Parker pulled out a deck of cards and they played for a while until Isaac tried to cheat by hiding cards under his leg. The home felt warmer with Isaac, the creaks of the old house faded in the laughter. When things settled down, Parker heard cabinets opening and closing downstairs.

His mom was probably still unpacking from the move.

""What's up?"" Isaac asked. ""Nothing, thought I heard something.""

Parker forced a friendly smile.

""Wanna watch a movie?"" He grabbed his portable DVD player and they crouched around it watching some blockbuster from the 80s about an alien invasion. Parker kept one ear out for the living room downstairs. The cabinet slamming had finally stopped. Did he imagine the whole thing? By midnight, they were sprawled out on the sleeping bag and bed surrounded by soda cans. 

Isaac sat up. ""You ever think about the future? Like, what do think you will do?""

Parker pondered the question as he stared up at the ceiling.

""An astronaut. I always wanted to see the moon up close.

Or an accountant. My dad says they make the big bucks.""

He glanced at Isaac.

""What about you?"" Isaac picked up a crumb from his shirt. ""Maybe something big, like a famous actor. Or maybe I'll just ride the rails,"" his tone was indifferent and he didn't even look at Parker. ""Not like my family has some great plans for me or anything.""

Parker waited patiently for more, but Isaac just yawned and rolled over in his sleeping bag. ""I'm about to crash.""

Parker got up and turned off the lights before going to bed himself.

Isaac's backyard rivaled a jungle exhibit with how the Kudzu vines overgrew the metal fence and with weeds so thick you could barely take a step without tripping. Isaac led the way with a deer path he had pulled and worn himself, while Parker trailed him breathlessly carrying his dome tent behind him like a wayward dog.

""This is it,"" Isaac said as he stomped to point to a clear circle among the weeds. ""Sorry for the long hike. My Grandma's got ears like a basset hound. She'd boil us alive if we wake her up.""

Parker turned and looked back at the house. From here it was only a black square against a larger black backdrop.

One small yellow light shone through a window.

""Is she really that mean?"" he inquired while wrestling with adjusting tent poles. Isaac leaned forward and snorted.

""She's not so much mean as she is old and cranky with a seven o'clock bedtime."" 

He said it in a matter of fact way that was relatable.

They finally got the tents up in enough time to beat the mosquitoes.

Isaac made a small fire in a circle of cinder blocks, painting his face in various orange hues, his expression all smiles.

""Rung Three,"" he announced before spearing a hot dog.

""Nervous yet?"" 

Parker laughed louder than he planned to and bit into his own hot dog.

It was awful. The outside was bitter and crunchy like charcoal but the inside was worse: soft, mushy and sour like old milk. The boys dared each other to eat more and more.

They ate six each and, surprisingly, nobody managed to puke.

Then, they moved on to other things: ghost stories.

Parker went first. He dropped his voice into a low, gravelly croak and told Isaac about a woman who had stumbled into his mother's emergency room in Terre Haute.

Her jeans were ripped from hip to ankle. Deep, self-inflicted claw marks were raked down her legs. When the nurses lifted her onto the table they noticed something under the skin of her thigh.

Upon closer examination, they saw that it wasn't a muscle or vein but a foreign bulge. It writhed slowly, like a wheat grain in a breeze. One nurse assumed it was some kind of parasite and took a scalpel into the red and swollen patch of skin.

As the skin was cut, something wet and slimy slid out.

It was a slick, slug-like creature that looked like black ink.

By the time it was completely extracted, it was the size of a fist. It was placed into the metal tray and immediately began consuming it into its faceless, jelly-like body.

The staff watched in horror as five more creatures slid out of the woman's leg and across the exam table.

They moved fast as lightning and began latching themselves onto the staff and patients. But they didn't just bite and hang like a deer tick. They ate.

""Six of those things wrecked havoc on the hospital that night.

It was evacuated and completely empty by morning.""

Isaac was quiet, almost seemed distracted. ""Did I scare you or put you to sleep?"" Parker joked, proud of his story but sure Isaac could do better.

""Nah, it was good. It's just...well have you ever been around someone who felt unreal?""

""What do you mean?""

""They act normal enough on a surface level. They greet neighbors and stick to their regular routines but the rest of the time, it's like they're still learning how to be human,""

Isaac leaned closer to the fire, which encouraged Parker to move closer as well. ""I learned about this story from Guatemalan Missionaries.""

Isaac leaned in and told his story like a monk recites a sacred text: slow with an enchanting rhythm, and unsettlingly calm. He told Parker the tale of a tiny, isolated tribe in Guatemala that was plagued by a spiritual sickness with no name and no known cause. It always began the same: fever, chills, aching joints. A normal, mild illness.

But after the fever breaks, the real symptoms show up. People would stall, freezing in the middle of a stride or mid-sentence like they were lagging in a video game. They would stare into nothingness, sometimes for hours, other times for a few minutes, as if their minds had been transported elsewhere.

Within weeks, the illness had spread, nearly twenty people began shuffling around like husks. The elders were fearful it would destroy the whole tribe and with no cure they were pressured to make an unthinkable decision.

They gathered all of the afflicted villagers into a wooden hut at the edge of the village and pushed a boulder in front of the entrance.

Then it was set on fire.

""The most unsettling part was the silence.""

The afflicted obediently walked into the shed without making a sound. Nobody banged on the door to escape. Not a single person even screamed. The only sound was the crackle of burning wood. Parker shuddered at the thought. Even though it wasn't a competition, Isaac clearly won.

Later, the pair raided Isaac's backpack and found bottle rockets.

They lit them off one by one, aiming toward the moon, the echo of the sound bounced off the pinewood like gunshots.

Each explosion tore across the sky, creating a bright and violent laugh that was only theirs, and in those few seconds the night belonged to them.

Eventually, they both crawled into their individual tents, physically tired but too energetic to sleep right away.

""Hey,"" Parker whispered from six feet away. ""You hear that?""

He looked into the lantern between them.

""What?""

""Nothing. It's great, isn't it?""

Isaac snorted. ""Yeah,"" he said back, sarcastically.

""It's great.""

No loud music, honking horns or drunk college students. Just the lullaby of the crickets and cicadas. Parker stared up at the ceiling of his tent feeling a great sense of belonging.

##Chapter 3

The next weekend, Parker's mom had another long shift, twelve to sixteen hours, depending on how many people were planning to drink and drive that night.

She left a twenty dollar bill on the fridge under a banana magnet with a note that said For Pizza. Parker was relieved.

He could invite Isaac over to play video games the whole night if they wanted. 

Isaac showed up around eight with a pillow case full of candy and all the blankets in his grandma's linen closet.

They went through Parker's room, too, ripping the covers off the bed and draping them over the dining chairs until the living room was a giant, sprawling blanket fort. Its turrets and tunnels could rival Mario Bros.

They started with Silent Hill 2, the PS2 whirring like a vaccum cleaner. Every sudden radio hiss made them jump. Isaac screeched really loud in Parker's ear during the alley encounter in the fog making him throw the controller and nearly pee himself. By 2 a. m. they were hyped up on sugar and horror. Constantly yelling, ""There was a HOLE,"" and tossing Jolly Ranchers at the TV whenever something moved in the dark. Parker passed out sometime around Brookhaven Hospital. Isaac awoke to the glow of the screen and the blinding bright sun of morning.

When he came back from the bathroom, he noticed Parker's mom pulling into the driveway.

He watched her get out of the car, pocket her keys and walk up the driveway.

Her eyes were vacant as she walked through the front door.

She took five steps before pausing for a while. After what felt like way too long, Isaac got nervous.

""Uh, Miss April?""

She didn't answer. Just kept staring like she saw something unusual in the distance. A rustle moved just out of Isaac's vision. Parker had shifted in his sleeping bag, pretending to wake up slowly, but Isaac sensed he was already awake.

He didn't say anything.

After about three minutes, Parker's mom continued walking down the hallway to the bathroom and turned on the water.

Isaac finally let out a breath he didn't realize he was holding.

""Rung four, done!"" Parker shouted enthusiastically nearly sending Isaac out of his skin in surprise.

""Almost halfway."" he replied while trying not to keep looking down the hall to the bathroom.

Parker's bedroom window slid upward with a noisy squeak. He paused briefly, paranoid his mom might hear it, but her bedroom door had been shut for hours and the sound of muffled TV infomercials played through the room. Isaac was already waiting outside down the street, he crouched under the huge tree out of view of the street lights carrying two fishing poles on his shoulder like rifles.

They rolled their bikes in the ditch to avoid the lights, walking slowly over the crunchy gravel.

When they got away from any surrounding houses or sidewalks, they hopped on their bikes and pedaled hard with wind and pine needles whipping their faces.

The creek was nice, a shimmering dime in a fountain of darkness. Isaac pulled out a six pack of Mountain Dew and handed Parker a fishing pole.

""How is this supposed to work with no light?""

""Watch,"" he whispered. Parker cast the line. Twenty feet out they heard a faint plop and splash.

""Hear that? That's where the big ones are.""

Isaac then cast his own line, it smacked the surface of the water like a diver. ""You don't need to look at the water,"" Isaac replied. ""Close your eyes. Let the creek tell you.""

Parker did. He breathed in the wet moss and closed his eyes, then flicked the line. This time he felt something tug, hard, just once, before the weight vanished. Isaac's bright smile flashed through the darkness.

""That's night fishing for you. Half listening, half praying.""

They never caught anything but mosquitoes, yet as Parker reeled in his line he didn't see it as empty; he was pulling the whole summer toward him, little by little.

A week later that same pull returned, but not on the line this time. Isaac showed up at Parker's at noon with a strange, chaotic energy. He wouldn't fully explain, just kept saying not to bring anything or take anything back. ""You'll see!""

The rickety shed sat crouched a hundred yards from the Highway, half swallowed up by weeds and rust. The roof was full of holes, letting the sun poke through like mini spotlights.

Isaac kicked the warped door leading to a mist of mildew, gasoline and dust. ""My dad used to use this place as a community shed. People could bring broken lawn equipment and it would get fixed. Nails, screws, everything available to give or take."" he walked over and put his hands on the wall.

A workbench sat in the corner propped up on wooden planks, topped with a coffee can full of nails. A rusted and broken lawnmower sat in the opposite corner under a bulletin board covered in yellowed newspaper pages dated a couple years ago.

LOCAL MISSIONARY COUPLE MISSING IN GUATEMALA 

Friends and family of David and Laura Boone, longtime members of Anniston Baptist Church and volunteers with Anniston Baptist Outreach, are pleading for answers after the couple disappeared in Central America.

According to Laura's mother, Mrs. Carter, the Boones made a brief satellite-phone call from a remote village on July 31.

""Laura told me they would be on the first flight out in a week.""

That was the last time anyone heard from them. When the couple failed to board their flight scheduled for August 6 from Guatemala City to Atlanta, church members called the mission board and Guatemalan authorities.

Before I could get close enough to see the picture of the family under the article, Isaac walked over.

His face went still as he leaned on the wall with his right arm covering up the newspaper.

""We should go before someone sees us,"" he muttered visibly uncomfortable as he fidgeted with his pocket.

Parker stepped over a spilled box that had once held rusted screws and matchbooks. He tried to pick it up but Isaac was there within seconds snatching it from his hand. For half a second Parker could see something raw and terrified flash across his face until the mask went back up.

""We're done. Just wanted you to see it,"" Isaac said, already moving to the exit.

They tumbled out the room into the blinding noonday light.

Isaac walked fast with his head down and jammed his hands into his pockets. Parker had to jog to catch up.

Half a mile down Highway 12, when the shed was only an indescript speck of brown in the distance, Isaac finally spoke again.

""Don't go back there without me."" They road their bikes home in silence to the smooth patter of the tires on asphalt.",1,1765637567.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1pln4fi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pln4fi/am_i_the_arsehole_for_stepping_away_from_my/,Am I the arsehole for stepping away from my therapist/friend/employee?,"About 1.5 years ago, I seeked a therapist and was recommended to someone locally. 

She held therapy sessions with me via zoom and on occasions we met in person. 

She was also a parent at my child's schools, so we saw each other daily at the school gates. 

I was having therapy at least once a week for 1 hour sessions which were costing me £100 per hour. Some weeks I had multiple sessions and on one occasion I had a 6 hour session costing £600. Over the space of 12 months I had spent alot of money on it. My reason for therapy was I had a bad childhood and now that I have children, I didn't want my children to experience what I did and I wanted to be a better person, I felt ill equipped to be everything they needed me to be, the role models I had growing up were not the best examples of how to be a parent, so learning to regulate myself, deal with past traumas and just be less in my own head (I have adhd and autism). 

I learnt alot or so I thought from my therapist and honestly thought I'd be in therapy long term for majority of my adult life, I used it as a safe space, a place to gage if I'm being rational or normal or if I should question myself more instead of situations ects. 

One week my therapist went on holiday, she started messaging me at this point and staying in touch, when she returned I had a therapy session booked in with her, she met me in person for coffee, she said she didn't feel I needed therapy anymore and that she wanted to be my friend instead. 

I was torn, I wanted a therapist but I also liked her as a friend too, she meant a lot to me and I had grown fond of her but I was concerned I'd have no safe space anymore and no therapist to help me manage myself. 

She said she could help me more as my friend and that I would see her more, be invited over to her house ect. 

I felt uneasy with it if I'm honest, my autistic self didn't know how to process it all, I didn't know how to be her friend or what that involved (I'm not a people person, I question everything the clicks, the looks and peoples general vibes). I was also scared of being rejected, losing a therapist and a friend. 

We spoke every day on WhatsApp, met up for coffees, had evening together for takeaways with our kids, i took her horse riding for her birthday, paid for us to go to a spa for my birthday, even took her to a cabin with a hot tub for a night. I own a company and my company helped her with a few things for free also.

One day I was due to see her and I picked her up, when she said I need to tell you something, she went on to explain her and her husband were splitting up, I was speechless, I didn't know what to say, it caught me off guard, I saw them together only a couple of weeks earlier all over each other madly in love, It didn't make sense to me which just sent me in to my silent state I was overwhelmed by it and didn't know what to say to her other than ask her if she was OK, for the next couple of hours she talked at me about it all, again I didn't know what to do. When I dropped her home, I felt like I was speechless still and if any think in shock. My mind went to our therapy sessions and how much she had cared for me, so I messaged her, saying I was sorry I went silent on her, I was shocked at what she was saying, and that I was so sorry she was going through this but I am here for her if she needed anything. 

I then checked in with her everyday to check she was OK, she was going through alot and her behaviour was changing, she wasn't the usual calm composed therapist anymore, she was emotional and having issues arise in different areas of her life. 

She said she was financially worried about how she would afford to keep her house and asked if she could be my assistant at my company.

My company is 1 year and 3 months old, its new and is growing but I didn't need a assistant. 

I said I didn't feel it was a good idea. My partner also didn't like the idea and said it would end badly, she's to strong willed and has been her own boss for a long time. 

I felt stuck, I didn't know what to do. 

I spoke with her and said I didn't need an assistant, she said she could tell I was stressed with the office stuff at work and she could take care of that part time to enable me more time to grow the business (she knew my 5 year business plan).

I agreed to trial it on a part time basis 1 day a week for 5 hours as my assistant, answering my calls, organising my quotes and general admin. She invoiced me at the end of week one for £796.00 for 1 days work. 

This is when a big red flag went up for me I agreed to £350 a week which I thought was steep anyway and an expensive I didn't really need to have. 

I spoke to her about it and said the company can not sustain that wage, infact it was more than I was earning as the director and owner. 
She said I needed to find away to afford it and that i knew what her hourly rate was as a therapist so because she was prioritising 1 day for my company she would need to charge a minium of £796, she had been through my previous invoices and suggested I add 20% more profit to every quote going forward, that she would work on bringing more clients in and expanding the business in year 2 instead of my planned year 3. She had created a spreadsheet of my costs. She had done market research which she presented to me showing other companies in my sector charging more than my company. This made me question my business and if I was running it properly. It made me doubt myself. So to not upset anyone, I paid her invoice and suggested she handled prices in quotes to see if it would generate the same amount of clients or of there would be a drop in work. 

We trialed it, I lost alot of clients, they went elsewhere due to costings. 

At this point I had paid £796 invoices each week. 

It wasn't working, I was so stressed with the finances and affording her invoices. I couldn't sleep or eat and I was financially taking the hit myself whilst making sure everyone else was paid. 

I was due to have a meeting with her regarding it all and to ultimately state its damaging my business, my family income and that I could not continue. 

That morning she called me, she said she needed to reply to some clients before coming to me and asked what I had planned for the clients so she could cost it and relay it to them before meeting me, I said don't worry about that it can wait, come to the meeting and I will sort it.... she replied with ""that's not the best use of my time, your investment in me is being wasted by having a meeting"".

At this point I had really had enough, I stated I needed her to stop what she is doing and to just come to the meeting. 

Her reply was "" I will give you time to calm down and when you can tell me why that's a good use of my time I will come to the meeting then"" 

My head was exploding, I was thinking about how I didn't want to upset her, how she's my friend, how she was my therapist, hows she's triggering me and not acknowledging it, how she's forcing me to back down to what she wanted, how I had planned this time to be free myself from tasks and my time away from my teams and my clients, how it was insulting that she thought I hadn't considered her time. 

I froze, I held the phone away from me and I wanted to scream. I composed myself and brought the phone back to my ear, to here her say ""I'm not playing your games, tell me how that is good use of my time"" 

I snapped and said I can't explain everything always, your overwhelming me and I planned this meeting to discuss a number of things and a number of issues we are facing but I am now done, I don't want to argue but I am done, I can't continue. She hung up. 

She sent me a message saying she never makes mistakes or issues (I had clearly gotten her back up) I apologised for how I handled myself and said I was sorry for losing my temper with her and that I should not have handled myself that way but it was insulting to me as her boss that she could not follow my instructions and that she insisted that I was wasting her time and not considering it properly. 

I replied and apologised for how I handled it all but that I still cared for her and respected her as my friend. 

She quit, which I was relieved about. 
She then deleted all invoices, quotes, client details ect everything and anything that I needed to pick up where she left off had been deleted. On social media she blocked and removed me, and she blocked my phone number. She unblocked me to send a message which read, ""stay away from me and my family"" 

I replied assuming I wasn't blocked again and put, is this all necessary? You was only at my house with your kids on Saturday, yes we have not agreed with each other work wise but really all this? How youve cut me off and been so cold like this, Am I that much of a bad person? And what's with the stay away from me and my family, you know me, you know I wouldn't do anything like that wtf. 

Her reply was... your tone has scared me, I'm protecting myself and if you can't understand that maybe you should speak to a therapist. 

I ignored it. I wanted to reply but there was no point, she had made her mind up and at no point was she apologising to me either or even taking any accountability for what happened, in her view it was all on me. 

So I left it, it hurt, made me question myself, made me wonder if people see me differently to what I think I am. Really messed my head up. 

A week later she messaged me and not going to lie it was like whiplash... ""hey hey hey, would you like to go for a coffee"" 

I was honestly like wtf is happening. 

I stated I was to busy with work to meet, but that I missed her. Because ultimately I did miss her, she meant alot to me so to go no contact, it did hurt and confused me. I thought maybe she reflected and calmed down enough to talk about things, but also I was cautious, I felt like I let her in to my life just for her to ditch me when she wanted and so coldly. I didn't know how to handle it either. 

So I kept to just replying on WhatsApp, avoided meeting her in person and just kept the chat simple and every day stuff. 

Then I hired a full time assistant for a set monthly affordable salary, it was posted on my company website and socials for a contact point for clients. 

That's when her behaviour changed again, she got really cold again, would leave my messages unread for days and would reply only when she wanted something. I felt used and like our friendship had long sailed. 

So I stopped messaging and stopped replying too. 

Beginning of this week, I got a email from her offering me group therapy sessions for a reduced rate. She then decided she would message me again, which just made me realise it was always about the money. 

She has used me for her financial gain, its made me question all my therapy sessions and if what I've learnt from her is the correct way of dealing with things, she's showed me how insecure she is, how fast her back goes up, how perfect she believes she is with not making any mistakes, I mean we are all human its in our nature to make mistakes right? 

So for me it got to crazy for me to truly understand. So I've stepped away, I've not replied and in the process I feel like I've let my guard down to let someone in and to care for someone who has just abused it all and use it to their advantage. 

It just blows my mind that she knows all about my passed, my traumas, my fear of rejection and how much I question everything I do and she chose to pick me up and drop me when it suited her. I feel like it's been very manipulative and like she wanted me to go running back to her but I haven't. 

Am I the arsehole in this situation? 

 

TLDR: hired a therapist, she suggested to be friends instead, then asked me for a job, charged me way more than agreed, questioned my use of her time, and ultimately dropped me stating she was scared of my tone, AITA for walking away when I realised its all about the money not a friendship?

1pln4a0,https://i.redd.it/27v2zyukiz6g1.jpeg,"Budget recap (44k) VT, June 2025","The 25k to 35k to 44k result lol. 

We had 104 guests, outdoor tent wedding at an inn.

This was for a wedding weekend, that included the following; a welcome cookout for 70 with beer and wine, breakfast for all guests, cocktail hour, significant passed apps, big local cheeseboard, salad course, dinner course, coffee service, two signature cocktails, and an open bar. We also had an after party where we served pizza, popcorn, and killed the kegs. They kept the bar open until 3 AM for us. Also breakfast, the next day was included. Our guests did pay for their own lodging at the inn, it was about $300 for a room for the weekend.

After touring a lot of single day venue where you very easily can spend 35+ grand on a single day. I did really like the idea of a wedding weekend in the same place. My family has had a lot of funerals lately and I am likely one of the only people who would throw a big wedding like this and the idea of like all of my friends and cousins being able to stay over 2 1/2 days and make a lot of new memories together was something I really liked/wanted.

**How we paid for it**: (outside of luck, financial stability, and good jobs)

When we moved in, we made a savings plan of each saving and our separate accounts a certain amount to get to 100K in five years total. I knew that I wanted to marry him, but I didn’t know at the time what kind of wedding I really wanted or he really wanted. I figured this was a good plan regardless we could use it for buying a house or if we broke up it would be a great vacation fund.

**How we saved cash:**

(We could have easily blown 100k)

\- Our photographer was in her first year of full-time. Had a reasonable travel fee, and was starting to offer Super8 video for a discount as she was brand new to it. She rocks.

\- I did some of my own flowers through a local flower farm. The flower farm did my bouquets for me and my bridesmaids which I’m really glad that they did. I would’ve really crashed out if I couldn’t get my bouquet right. I did my centerpieces and my bud vases. They came out so good. To do your own flowers you must have time, space, and mental energy. Many people do not - that is your word of caution.

\- Our candles and candleholders came from IKEA. I tried facebook marketplace for these, just never had great luck.

\- Flower girl baskets I got at Goodwill as Easter baskets and painted them white. 5 bucks total.

\- My sister works at a high-end salon, and I have been a loyal customer, and she asked that if her fellow stylist could attend the wedding that they could do my party as a gift. She also paid for a significant chunk of my makeup artist. Which tbh is because she’s picky lol. 

\- Canva!!! We designed and printed our save the dates, invitations, brochures, matchbox, crossword puzzle, seating chart, and I’m sure something else.

\- Our celebrant was a dear family member. We got married at City Hall in the city we live in, about two weeks ahead of our actual wedding.

\- my MIL did our welcome bags and they were so cute.

\-3 Bridesmaids and 3 Groomsmen. I did have to go have uncomfortable conversations with folks who I had been in their wedding. They were all really nice and understanding because I made sure to have the conversation before it was too late. Could’ve really overspent had these parties been bigger.

\- Supportive Fiancé, lol, I am the kind of person that has been thinking about my wedding since I was five. My partner knew this, and I made it easy for him to help. We had a lot of organization that helped at one point he surprise me with some really great graphic design knowledge which really helped during when we were designing our invitations on Canva.

**Where we spent over**:

\- Rush shipping

\- I paid for my bridesmaids hair and makeup and made them personal goodie bags for the wedding. They each got L.L. Bean boat & totes and L.L. Bean towel with their name on it, lots of small things that I felt really were them. I did not keep track of this and it really ballooned.

\- Both of us ended up getting second outfits. Honestly, it killed though I don’t really regret it.

\- I could have sent my mom MIL and celebrant to the local salon to get hair and make up done. It messed with my timeline and it was really expensive. 

Hands down, we would spend the money again in a heartbeat. I really wrestled with how much money we was spending for what we was getting when we first started wedding planning I end up reading Priya Parker’s the art of gathering book and it really did help shift my perspective of what I actually wanted out of a wedding, that I in turn talked over with my now husband.

1pln2qg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExistentialJourney/comments/1pln2qg/cold_coffee_on_a_bland_morning/,Cold coffee on a bland morning,"​I usually rode the 6 am train to my workplace. Rushing at breathtaking speeds and tearing through the morning fog. No matter how early I tried to reach the train, it was always crowded. I tried and worked a lot on my schedule. Eventually, I gave up.

​This morning was the same. I stood, and after some brief yawns and naps, the train stopped on the station. I was pushed outside by the crowd. Strange enough, the train seemed so empty just after I stepped out of it.
​I proceeded with the checking, the toll, and ticket procedures.

​Then I walked down, and after a long walk, eventually reached the main road.
​After some hand gestures and maddening misses, I finally caught a bus. It was crowded even more than the train. People were inside it. People were even on the roof.

My mother had gracefully ironed the leather suit I wore. She did so every day. It was squeezed against my bones. I didn't care. I was just happy I somehow found an abode and was content enough with the idea that I had a destiny awaiting me.
​After like half an hour, I made my way to the door and pushed it open.
A long breath of relief and a proud smile on my face.
​I walked to the left of the bus station.

​My office. A wide, 3-storied building with an irritating red yellow paint. Its edges and corners around the windows were painted in an ordered fashion. Its entrance was always clean. Men and women with bags and papers were scattered in its big yard. Iron stairs shone with fresh layered oil.
​For some reason, all of this made me sick.
​But I couldn't go back now.

​So with a heavy heart and cursing my fate, I entered the building and tried to greet everyone with a smile, whose judges were they themselves.
​I threw myself against the wooden chair. I pulled my laces and rendered my shoes loose. The cold morning and I burnt the furnace besides my desk.
The floor of my office was carpetted with a police green cloth. On my desk I saw some coloured files and papers scattered. Stamps and pen holders were arranged in order.

​Ahead of the desk was a large aluminium closet and besides it was an empty book rack.
​Behind my seat was a large window. One could see the entire Srinagar old town from there. There was also a lovely rose garden just below the window. I loved to watch the wet roses and often kept the window open so that their smell filled the office.

​Some good-hearted fellow had burnt the garden because it was illegally sown by some lady on a private property.
​I never opened the window. Its corners had jammed in time.
​My office was ever empty. I was the head of ""FOOD management.""
Everyone was content with the food the dear maid cooked. Even me.
So promotion came quickly in this illiterate shed. I was happy with the barter of success over loneliness. Now I wondered in silence what exactly was it that I wanted.

​I thought of asking her for marriage. Her pale skin, her tender fingers and her red lips which reminded me of those burnt roses. The way she curled her messy hair amidst her work and the sorrowful expression on her face whenever she was bossed. I loved her.
​But something took hold of me. I shook away my century-long fantasies in a moment of smile.

​Night slowly engulfed the grey-blue sky. I walked slowly. The cold air near my mouth was filled with the smoke from my cigar. I held it between my teeth and even chewed it occasionally.

​The same walk to the left. Moments of gestures and maddening misses. I finally caught a cab. The seat was comfortably open. Though my face was too tired.
​I threw my bag on the left.
​The driver was silent. The silence was occasionally broken as I snapped from my dream due to the radio. Some folk song was playing out loud. I hummed along.
​The cab window opened and I stepped out.

​I reached the same corner and walked long until I reached the station.
​I don't remember anything after I climbed the stairs. As if my body moved on its own, I somehow reached the bench and I saw a ticket in my hand.
​I closed my eyes again. A deep darkness and a long silence.
​I opened my eyes again and I was standing in the same train.
My eyes were half open.

It tore through the evening fog and after some yawns and naps, it stopped.
​I was pushed out by the crowd. I stepped out with my bag in my hand.
​For some strange reason, the train still looked empty to me.
​I passed out again.
​I opened my eyes.
​I saw my mother. With her face, her withered lips curved in a smile.
Her weak hands moved in a circular motion.
She looked at me with her fallen eyelids and lifeless cheeks.
​I paused for a moment. I smiled",1,1765637305.0,ExistentialJourney,0,1.0,False

Any words of wisdom from people that have the same affinity with these behaviours towards food would be incredible please! 🙏 

I am 21 F and I have found myself not eating anything until dinner, during the day I won’t eat anything at all (not even tea or coffee) only lots of water until around 8pm when I have dinner. Often I find myself absolutely destroying a meal at dinner time but even lately, I haven’t been able to eat much for dinner. That being said, I am still quite overweight. That weight hasn’t decreased at all with these eating habits, which makes no sense biologically I feel? 

My goal isn’t to lose weight, I just want to start eating clean but I feel like I haven’t had the energy to prepare the meals needed to eat clean so therefore I just haven’t been eating. I have also started to feel nauseous when I eat anything, even on the first bite and especially if I eat before dinner. 

If anyone has any tips on whether this could be an eating disorder or some sort of medical issue I should see a doctor about (like an imbalance in my hormones or something similar) that would be great! Also any tips on how to eat healthier without the guilt and without feeling like I need to be sick afterwards would be very helpful! 

Thank you so much in advance!

For years, I beat myself up about this. I thought I was lazy, undisciplined, or just bad at time management.

But then I noticed a weird pattern. If I give myself an entire Saturday to clean my apartment, it takes the entire Saturday. I’ll move slowly, get distracted by old photos, and take coffee breaks. But if I find out guests are coming over in 20 minutes? I can clean the entire place top-to-bottom in 19 minutes flat..

I eventually learned that this isn’t just a quirk; it’s a concept called **Parkinson’s Law**

The law states that ""Work expands to fill the time available for its completion"".

Basically, the ""size"" of a task isn't determined by how difficult it is. It’s determined by how much time you allot for it. If you give yourself a week to write a report, your brain will subconsciously complicate the task until it actually *takes* a week to do.

I stopped giving myself plenty of time to finish projects. Now, I use aggressive deadlines. I’ll tell myself, ""I have to finish this draft by 11:00 AM because I have a hard stop,"" even if the hard stop is just me going to get a sandwich.

Does anyone else function way better under productive panic, or does that just burn you out? I’m trying to find the balance between using this law for speed without spiking my blood pressure every day.",1,1765636938.0,productivity,2,1.0,False

1plmvac,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1plmvac/copper_rich_foods_make_my_spleen_hurt_could_it_be/,Copper rich foods make my spleen hurt? Could it be Wilson's?,"Hi there, 

Thanks for clicking on this thread. Please feel free to ask follow up questions but I want to keep this as succinct as possible while still providing some detail. This is pretty long, please bear with me.

First, some brief background on me. I am a 37 year old male with no other previous significant health conditions known.

In order of appearance of potential Wilson's symptoms, I have experienced the following:

1. Long-standing shaky hands (this goes back many years, hard to say when it started). This issue has intensified since summer 2023. Fine motor tasks like delicately flipping an egg in a frying pan or dicing vegetables became very difficult. This symptom was alleviated for a while by very high doses of zinc in summer 2024. This relief lasted until approximately October 2025, at which point it presented again, though it is not (yet?) as intense as it was from summer 2023 to summer 2024.

2. Long-standing tendency to insomnia which intensified to an extreme degree in summer 2023. Starting at that point, I found it basically impossible to sleep for the first 4-5 hours of the night (11 PM to 3-4 AM), every night. Many, many nights it took me until after 5 AM to fall asleep, but this was less typical. On a handful of nights I slept for zero minutes.

This happened in spite of trying to follow good sleep hygiene practices - careful management of wake times, staying off of screens at night, cognitive restructuring to calm down any anxious thoughts I had, trying not to eat close to bedtime, not spending daytime hours in the bedroom lounging. My sleep hygiene wasn't perfect in that I probably could have done better with regular early morning light exposure, and having a wind-down routine, but I don't think it would have made much difference, given the extreme severity and persistence of this symptom.

I tried OTC sleep aids and they did not work - NyQuil didn't work, 5 htp didn't work, melatonin didn't work. On days where I was active and got exercise, this did not help me to sleep either. I don't believe in Ambien so I wasn't seeking an Rx from a doctor at this point but rather telling myself I had to do better with self-management of my sleep hygiene. This symptom also was alleviated for a while with high dose zinc supplementation (magnesium supplements and Epsom salt baths also helped). This symptom didn't entirely go away, but it was lessened in intensity such that it was unusual that I would sleep less than 6 hours per night, and I was often able to sleep 7-8 hours per night, sometimes for multiple nights in a row. As of October 2025, I am finding it extremely difficult to sleep.

This isn't a typical early symptom of Wilson's, but there are reports of this in the literature, from what I have been able to find.

1b/2b. Please note that in summer 2023, without realizing it at the time, I happened to increase the copper content of my diet significantly. I started regularly eating a few handfuls of nuts daily (around 50 or 100 g most days), as well as occasionally eating sunflower seeds in salads, eating potatoes and Japanese sweet potatoes regularly, and having a tablespoon (about 5 g) of cocoa in my morning cup of coffee every day (this was almost always my only caffeine for the day). It was just a few months ago that I made this potential link between copper in my diet and the symptoms described above.

Copper, when it is not bound to ceruloplasmin, aka free copper, is active on the nervous system and can result in dramatically increased norepinephrine production and a down regulation of dopamine. It leads to a constantly panicky feeling, even when you know for sure that there's nothing real to panic about. Hand tremor is a more typical early symptom of Wilson's if I'm not mistaken.

3. I also often had an itch right at the moment when I could feel that I was about to finally drift off to sleep. Sometimes I would have a little itch while almost falling asleep dozens of times in a night (this was pretty typical but didn't always happen). I could never find any irritant or reason for the itch on the surface of my skin or in my bed or environment in general; I don't think this was some strange allergy. This may be related to a dysfunctional liver but I'm not clear on this. Zinc relieved this symptom pretty effectively, which was incredible because this symptom felt like some strange torture method, tantalizing me with the prospect of sleep and then making it impossible with an unignorable but pretty minor itch on a random spot on my body.

4. Spleen pain which began in about January 2025. At least, I think it is my spleen, so far this is a self diagnosis. It's a pain that is in a spot I'd never felt before until this past year, in my upper left quadrant of my abdomen, and it doesn't feel like intestinal pain. It first became really apparent in January 2025 when I was eating kind of a poor diet for a few days while enjoying some Christmas chocolates perhaps a little too much. This symptom mostly cleared up for a while, appearing intermittently and seemingly unpredictably until about April or May 2025. Eventually I realized that my diet played a significant role and that on days where I missed eating eggs for breakfast and a large portion of chicken at dinner (pretty typical for me but not an every single day thing), this was when my spleen would hurt. I surmised that this was due to the selenium content of eggs and chicken. I started eating brazil nuts and aiming for about 200 mcg of selenium per day and my spleen didn't hurt for several months.

Since late November 2025, this pain has become more unmanageable. Selenium supplements (I recently stopped eating brazil nuts because of their copper content) and selenium rich animal foods no longer soothe my spleen. I ate a small avocado (a high copper food) two days in a row a couple of weeks ago and experienced what I am pretty certain were shooting/stabbing pains and other intense, acute pains in my spleen, especially on the night after the second avocado. My liver also felt like it was swollen (more on that in a moment). Since then I have been trying to limit my copper intake a lot, but I found myself doubting whether this made sense when my GP told me a few days ago that I should stop obsessing about the copper content of my diet (my appointment with him was so brief I didn't have time to explain about the spleen pain after avocado, but I will do this when I see him next. He is new to me and I found him to help me figure out what I'm posting about here). All I had time to tell him really was that eating a lot of copper made me feel bad and seemed to give me neurological symptoms. He handwaved the zinc helping as somehow “placebo” (even though I am taking doses that would make most people puke and have abdominal pain and diarrhea, and for me that dose makes my GI system feel really good.. I didn't say that part because I didn't have time either) but he didn't dismiss the idea that copper intake could be causing neuropathy without it being my imagination. I think he's willing to hear me out but the way appointments are done in Ontario (Canada) makes them quite brief and there is little time to unpack something as complex and opaque as all of this seems to be. Now, before I digress too much.. I have found through careful observation of my diet and symptoms that if I eat more than about 0.6 mg of copper in a day, I start to have symptoms. They seem to intensify relative to the amount of copper I consume over that threshold, and to get slowly and progressively worse, day by day lately.

After that bit of self-doubt about restricting copper, I decided to just try eating normally yesterday, eating foods that totaled to about 1.5 mg copper for the day (according to Cronometer). The only especially copper rich meal was about 20 g of organic pumpkin seeds and 30 g peanuts for breakfast (not including any organic copper pesticide content, Cronometer has this at 0.4 mg copper in the two foods). I felt absolutely horrible last night, my spleen hurt a lot and it felt like it did after eating those two avocados. My liver felt swollen and I had some pain, kind of just above where I think is my transverse colon. This started up a few hours after eating dinner and got worse a few hours after that, as I was trying to get to sleep.

5. Peripheral neuropathy - this symptom started in August 2025 when I tried to stop taking a lot of zinc for about 4 days. Previously to this I had had some numbness in my clavicles once in 2022 when I forgot my longtime (since 2014), much smaller daily zinc dose. This peripheral neuropathy presents mainly as numbness in the skin on the centre of my forehead. Sometimes the numbness spreads more, to more of the sides and back of my skull as well as my chin and jawline, toes and edges of feet, and sometimes my upper back and/or my clavicles (these last two are rarer so far). For a month or perhaps a bit more, resuming the high doses of zinc, and increasing them slightly, relieved this neuropathy. Now zinc doesn't seem so effective whereas restricting copper while continuing the high zinc dose seems to help relieve this and preserve sensation.

6. Liver swelling - this symptom may have presented earlier, it is hard to say, but in the last few weeks it has become unmistakable. See above commentary on spleen pain as these incidents have all also involved my liver swelling. In addition to high dose zinc, I have also been taking choline regularly since summer 2024 (initially for more general reasons, and I kept doing it because it really helped my cognitive function which was often quite bad). I take about 840 mg per day usually, in phosphatidyl choline. I also have been taking NAC, something I tried a long time ago with some success, to calm intrusive thoughts, not for any liver concerns.

I also want to mention that I'm pretty certain that I developed some jaundice in summer 2023 when I started eating all of that copper. It lasted maybe a week and abated I think by my resuming NAC which I had been off of altogether for a while at that point. There may have been other reasons it cleared up, like me unintentionally decreasing copper intake from my diet, but I can't be sure as I don't have food logs from that time period, or any other record.

7. Blood copper and ceruloplasmin values - I have had copper tested 3 times (once in late August, once in late September, and then once more last week) and it has been right inside the lower bound of the normal range every time (in spite of taking a lot of zinc for many months in a row). My ceruloplasmin in late September was 0.17 g/L in a reference range of 0.15 to 0.30. I'm not sure what my ceruloplasmin was on my latest test because my doctor didn't want me to obsess so much about all of these details. I think it was low again, but still in the normal range. These values are typical of some Wilson's patients as I understand things, but it's possible that they're the result of high dose zinc supplementation over many months. If that were the only data point suggesting Wilson's, I wouldn't be writing this post.

8. Liver values - on the same 3 tests mentioned, these values have been normal. But I have read in the practice guidance from the Wilson's Disease Association that Wilson's can present with splenomegaly without any signs of liver pathology (and if I'm not mistaken, the liver can sometimes become cirrhotic without any indication of dysfunction on blood testing). Obviously liver swelling suggests something more is going on.. But it's been so intermittent so far..

9. Other things of note - my physiology really, really likes a lot of zinc. The best I have ever felt physically, hormonally, and in a certain sense, psychologically - that is the physiological side of my psychology - in my entire life, hands down, has been in this past year, for a few months here and there. It's been spotty but consistent enough to be sure that zinc is having this effect on me. Food tastes better than it ever had before in my life. I can keep my eyes open without them watering uncontrollably on a sunny day. I can literally hear people better and discern the words in their speech more easily than ever (I'm no longer constantly asking people to repeat themselves because even though I could hear the noises they were speaking, my brain couldn't parse them into words properly). My interoception has improved dramatically. I find maintaining attentional focus easier and I find it easier to ignore background stimuli that I used to need a lot of warming up to get comfortable with. I could keep going but you get the point. My GI tract also functions much better, I no longer suffer from chronic constipation unless I make sure to hit the very upper bound of what is recommended for fibre for someone who eats my diet (about 3k calories per day needing about 42 g fibre per day, following guideline of 14 g fibre per thousand calories of food). I no longer have chronic GERD after almost every meal.

If you made it this far, thank you for reading all of this. I'm not sure how to proceed - how do I get my doctor to listen to me and take me seriously, and how do I get the point across in a 10-15 minute appointment? If my spleen hurts right now, but I don't have other clinical signs, can I wait until I can see my doctor early this week?

1plmtfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CATHELP/comments/1plmtfh/cat_wont_stop_crying_or_relax/,Cat won't stop crying or relax,"I ( 43F, US ) have a 7 year old female cat who has a very hard time relaxing. She cries regularly at night about 2 hours before i wake for my work day, and will pace/ circle/ cry once I'm home from work as well. She is taking prozac. She is blind from birth, has no eyes, and while I don't think her lack of sight is the cause of this, I wouldn't be surprised if whatever is the cause of her behavior is comorbid with whatever prevented her eyes from developing in the first place. At the very least, the visiual stimulus would help to tire her a bit, but no such luck for her. 

Mainly, she cries at night. Loudly and clearly, as though she's looking for someone's attention. Often times, it's maybe 2 hours before I wake up for work ( which sucks on a weekend ) , but also not uncommon for it to randomly be at, like, 1:30 AM, no rhyme or reason. She likes to sleep by my head, and on the best of nights, she'll just stay there without crying at all, but she's usually tapping me at some point to get me to pet her, swapping pillow sides and tapping til I swap sides too. I generally don't care about the tapping, but coupled with the crying, it's a lot. I don't sleep well.

The crying is a bit better once I'm awake and out of bed, but it still happens. There's a lot of hallway pacing. My husband works from home, and he says she just sleeps on one of the beds while he works, will follow him for lunch on the couch and rest on him there. However, once I'm home, she's back to being anxious. Often times running to the door to greet me, but then circling the coffee table, pacing, crying for attention. She cries if we're on opposite floors and cries if I'm not in the same room as her when she wants me to be. I often have to get her and bring her to me, and I often bring her with me before she has a chance to cry about me leaving. 

We've taken her to the vet twice so far this year, and she's been taking a low dose of subdermal Prozac since July. It helped her to stop circling a few months there, she was resting easier, but she's back at it. A recent vet visit gave her a clean bill of health, no concerns otherwise, and they sent us home with Gabapentin for nights where it's really bad, but this doesn't feel like a long term solution. Like, I plan to give her some on nights where I NEED to sleep, but giving it to her at 3:30-4:00 AM when my alarm is at 5:30 seems pointless.

I had anticipated a blood test, but the vet suspected it would not reveal any issues related to her behavior. Blood test option is still on the table if I wanna try it.

Added info: I've been going to this vet office for 17 years and trust their opinions. I'm fortunate to live near an ivy league school with a great veterinary medicine program, and they have a ton of vet techs and interns from this university. 

We adopted her 4 years ago, and there was a little bit of crying at night then, but that was the extent of her behavioral issues. I chalked it up to her being young and bounced around a few foster homes before we adopted her, just getting used to her surroundings. 

Also, fully acknowledging this seems like a neediness that gets worse in my presence. Before anyone suggests she needs another cat friend, we do have another cat. We had 3 cats for a while, but had to say goodbye to our oldest last August due to hyperthyroidism and kidney failure. Those two cats coexisted well, but once she passed away, the anxious cat started chasing our 3rd away. Lately, they've been able to sit in the same room as each other, but once blind cat senses her, she spooks the other back out of the room. It kills us, they could be good company for each other, but I digress. 

Honestly, the neediness feels a lot like caring for our cat with hyperthyroidism and kidney failure, but at least then we knew it was palliative care. 

If anyone has any suspicions or experience with this type of behavior, I'd love to hear about it. My husband and I are about at our wits end. We're not people who give up on pets and have really persevered through taking in strays, feral friends, acclimating this bland cat and our other visually impared cat, and other pet health issues. We've spent months allowing cats to become comfortable in their new home in thepast; we're not the type to throw in the towel. I'm willing to provide any other info ya want here, I hope this wasn't all a bunch of rambling. I just ... really need sleep and the ability to relax in my own home.

ETA: I love my cat! When she's relaxed, she's goofy and playful. Her meows are kinda funny when they're not incessant, and she's got a funny subtle underbite. I want to help her, and I need to for the sake of my sanity. As fed up as I am, I still love our weirdo lady. ",2,1765636587.0,CATHELP,1,1.0,False

I’m hoping I could ask for a bit of help here with my next steps while on TRT - I have some general thoughts but I wanted some insight from the group.

I was diagnosed with low T in September of this year, my free T was at 238 pmol/L and my total T was at 8.6 nmol/L. 

I was also 247lbs and 6’ 1”.

I started at 100mg of testosterone enanthate twice a week and found that by the end of the 3rd day prior to my next shot I was quite tired and down compared to the other days so we switch to “every 3 days” which resulted in 125mg a week.

Significantly better feeling and results with the higher frequency of dosing, I also started doing cardio workouts every morning and adjusted my diet. Eliminated all alcohol consumption, intermittent fast until 12PM - eat a protein and fats rich meal - only eat carbs at the end of the day and only complex carbs. I found that I would crash mid day if I had any simple carbs at lunch.

My lunch now consists of:

250g lean ground beef
4 eggs
1 avocado 
Chili crisp

1 scoop whey gold standard
250ml 1% milk

I’ve been feeling great, I’m down 16lbs so far! 

I have a healthy fats, veggies, salad and a small amount of complex carbs.

We just finished our home gym and I have been weight lifting for the last 3 weeks - huge changes so far physiologically and I’m loving the results.

After workout I have 10g of creatine monohydrate and LMNT electrolyte drink

Recently I’ve felt a bit tired in the afternoon and reaching for a second cup of coffee, and have gone in for my 3 month follow up for blood work, results are in.

Total Test:

8.6 -> 26.1 nmol/L

Free test:

238 -> 760 pmol/L

We also tested Estradiol and SHBG this time:

Estradiol - 167 pmol/L

SHBG - 19.2 nmol/L

I discussed with my doctor about the results, were very happy with where total and free test have landed, don’t need to up the dosage at all. The Estradiol is a little high but nothing crazy yet - my Dr did offer for me to start on an AI to help but the laundry list of negative side effects have turned me off of that. 

I’m actively working on reducing body fat %, my scale says I’m at 31% body fat, down from 33% when I first started. 

I’ve been reading that my SHBG is a bit on the lower side which could be contributing to the Estradiol as well as my higher body fat %. So my primary target is to lower body fat and raise SHBG through diet and exercise. 

I have also started taking:

A multivitamin that includes vitamin D3 and K2
Collagen powder
Omega 3 + coQ10 pills

Do you have any thoughts or insight? Keep trucking on as I am now since all of my blood work is within range otherwise? 

Overall I feel amazing, much better than I did before so I’d ideally not want to drop my dosage and work through this naturally.

Please let me know if any additional information would be helpful. I’ve been recommended to start on other supplements such as the big R but I’d like to avoid if possible.

I haven’t had ANY negative side effects from the TRT or Estradiol such as nipple sensitivity, mood swings or ED. In fact TRT has solved almost every thing I could have asked for.

I eventually convinced my cardiologist to order an MRI and Lo and behold it showed myocardial scarring and a small pericardial effusion. 

This causes chest pain, PVC’s, shortness of breath and a great degree of anxiety. I can’t drink any caffeinated beverages like coffee without the symptoms tripling. My cardiologist has me on colchicine and wants to review me in 3 months. 

Before my diagnosis, doctors were consistently telling me it was probably just GERD and anxiety. It was highly discouraging because I knew there was something wrong with me. If you got that gut feeling, I recommend pushing for an MRI. The sooner you know what it is, the sooner you can stop testing and start treating.

He told me that in order to apply for a business license, a physical store is required.
He also said that if he sets up a limited liability company, the registered capital must be at least 50,000 RMB.

Is this information correct?
Does anyone have experience opening an online shop selling pre-packaged food products?
I would really appreciate some advice.
Thank you very much!

我的一位中国朋友打算开一家网店，销售速溶咖啡，他目前住在上海。
他说，申请营业执照需要有实体店。
另外，如果注册有限责任公司，注册资本至少需要 5 万元人民币。

这些说法正确吗？
有没有人有开网店销售预包装食品的经验？
希望大家能给我一些建议。
