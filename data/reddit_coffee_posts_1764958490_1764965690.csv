1pf5bsm,https://i.redd.it/8ypbrecb0g5g1.jpeg,How do you STORE your coffee beans? Airtight canisters vs bags — what works best for you?,"I’ve been experimenting lately with different ways to keep my coffee beans fresh, and I realized people from different countries have totally different habits when it comes to storage.

So I’m curious:

How do YOU store your beans at home?

• Original bag?
• Airtight container?
• Vacuum canister?
• Freezer?
• Something else entirely?

I recently tried an airtight stainless steel canister with a freshness window (like the Veken style), and it made me wonder how much difference proper storage actually makes in taste — especially for espresso lovers.

For those of you from heavy coffee-drinking countries like Finland, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, the US, Canada, Australia, and the UK:

👉 Do you notice a real flavor improvement with airtight canisters?
👉 How long do your beans usually last before losing freshness?
👉 Do you prefer containers with CO₂ valves or just simple airtight ones?

Feel free to share photos of your setup — I’d love to see how everyone keeps their beans fresh at home ☕🔥",1,1764965457.0,u_ExcellentTown3687,0,1.0,False

Please help!,"I recently made a new friend through work (she was with us temporarily). For context I’m a female in my late 20s, married, she’s older, probably mid to late 40s, has kids and is a divorcee. In the professional setting we clicked well and had good chats. I agreed to send her my personal number after she left our team, but now I’m regretting it.

I’m pretty sure I have AuDHD (not formally diagnosed, yet) so I really struggle with intense social contact, especially replying regularly to messages. I tend to only see my closest friends every few months and only reply to messages every few weeks at best. I also struggle in new social settings or being stuck somewhere for too long without an easy way to leave the situation. 

She has been messaging me almost daily since I gave her my number. I then told her I’m bad at texting / replying and find it hard, thinking she’d get the hint. She still kept sending me lots of messages, including a suggestion to meet up, which includes a 2 hour round trip to somewhere I’ve never been before, where she said she’ll drive me. 

The idea makes me highly uncomfortable as I barely know her. I didn’t open the message and left it a couple days. She then double messaged me. Left it a couple more, and she’s messaged me again. I really don’t want to pursue this friendship any more since I feel in my gut something isn’t right, but I don’t know how to say it, and I’m worried about coming across rude or upsetting her. Nothing she‘s done is malicious and I did initially agree to meet up, but I envisioned something casual like a local walk or a coffee, not a 2 hour car journey with a stranger.

“Later, Sofa,” one boy snickered as she passed him.

Another girl chimed in, “Don’t trip, Sofa… wouldn’t want anything to fall out!”

A couple of kids laughed.  
Not loudly.  
Not cruelly.  
Just… casually.

Like her nickname was something the whole world had quietly agreed on.

Sophia didn’t correct them. She never did.

She hurried down the steps, keeping her head low. The afternoon sunlight felt too bright, like a spotlight she didn’t want. Her shoelaces slapped against the pavement as she walked, almost jogged, away from the bus.

Nobody followed her.  
Nobody needed to.  
The name had done its job.

She reached her house in under a minute, slipping inside and shutting the door behind her with a quiet click.

The silence felt like a blanket.

Her mom called from the kitchen,  
“Hi, sweetie! Dinner in ten. Start your homework, okay?”

“Okay,” Sophia said, her voice small.

She climbed the stairs to her room, dropped her backpack in the corner, and sat on the edge of her bed. Her eyes stung, but she swallowed the feeling down hard. She hated crying. Hated giving anything that much space.

Dinner was spaghetti and garlic bread. Her dad told a joke she didn’t laugh at. Her mom asked about school and Sophia said “fine” in the practiced way kids do when *fine* is the only answer adults are willing to accept.

She cleaned her plate, rinsed it in the sink, and lingered for a moment.

“Um,” she said softly, twisting the hem of her shirt, “can I…play on the computer tonight? Please?”

Her dad smiled. “Homework done?”

She nodded. Not a lie. Not the truth either.

“Well, you’ve earned some time,” he said. “Just an hour on school nights, okay?”

Sophia brightened, the first real spark in her face all afternoon. She slipped into the little office corner off the hallway where the family computer sat on a wooden desk. The monitor was the big box kind, the keyboard loud and clacky. The tower hummed softly with warmth. On the desk beside it sat a brand-new jewel case, shiny and unopened until last weekend.

**FREEW!LL™**  
A Life Simulation Game  
Create. Build. Control.

Grass-green logo. Smiling families. A perfect suburban street.

Sophia slid into the chair and double-clicked the icon.

The cheerful synth music began to play.  
The loading bar crept forward.

Her breathing eased for the first time that day.

This world made sense. This world listened to her. This world didn’t laugh at her, or bump her shoulder, or whisper her name wrong on purpose.

When the save file appeared, she clicked on it eagerly.

Her town loaded.  
Little houses.  
Little streets.  
Little families.  
**Her** families.

And then her eyes widened.

“Oh…” she whispered.

She had forgotten to put the pool ladder back.

There on screen, the girl she called “Megs” was just a little floating icon now, hovering over the deep end, her need bars flashing red.

Sophia frowned thoughtfully. Not angry. Not sad. Just…curious.

She clicked the **Build Mode** button.

A holographic grid spread across the lot.

She selected the pool ladder.  
Rotated it.  
Placed it back onto the pool edge with a cheerful chime.

“Oops,” she murmured, giggling under her breath. “Didn’t mean to…drown you.”

She clicked back to **Live Mode**.

And Megan bobbed to the surface.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Something cold touched my hand.

Metal.

A rung.

I didn’t question it. I grabbed it with everything left in me.

My body surged upward as if the water released me all at once. I tore myself out of the pool, gasping so violently my throat spasmed. Chlorine burned my lungs. The world spun.

Someone shouted my name.

Hands grabbed my shoulders.

“Megan! Holy shit! Megan, breathe!”

James.

Then Ashley.

Then Natalie.

They were kneeling around me, frantic, dripping water on the concrete as they crowded in.

“Oh my God,” Ashley said, her voice shaking. “You scared the hell out of us.”

“What happened?” Natalie asked, rubbing circles on my back as I coughed. “Did you… did you cramp up? Or panic? You looked fine one second and then you…”

“I didn’t see you struggling,” James said quietly. “I swear, Megan. You were just swimming. And then you were gone.”

I spat out water, chest still heaving.

They were talking over each other.

Panic. Confusion. Explanations.

All reasonable.

All wrong.

“I…” My voice cracked. “I couldn’t get out. The walls were too tall. The ladders were gone…”

“There were ladders,” Ashley said quickly. “Both of them. They’re right there.”

I looked. She was right. Two ladders. One on each side. My mouth went dry.

“You probably panicked,” Natalie said, trying to soothe me. “Or got light-headed from swimming too long. It happens.”

Maybe to them. Maybe in a normal world. But I know what I felt. What I saw. What had happened. Something had changed the pool. Something had removed the ladders. Something had trapped me. This wasn’t panic. Or a cramp. Or overexertion. It was bigger. Way bigger.

And as my friends hovered over me. Worried, relieved, oblivious. I realized something terrifying.

While I was under there,

it didn’t feel like malice.

It felt like indifference.

Like I was just an afterthought.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Sophia couldn’t sleep that night.

She lay in bed staring at the glow-in-the-dark stars stuck to her ceiling, replaying the moment she placed the pool ladder back in **FREEW!LL™**. The cheerful chime. The way her Sim’s head bobbed above the water again. The bright green orb floating over her returning to normal.

It felt…good.

Not the warm, fuzzy kind of good.

Something sharper.

More electric.

She had changed the world with one click. She had saved a life she had nearly taken. Or… prevented something she caused. She wasn’t sure. But the feeling was addictive. She fell asleep smiling.

The next morning was the same as every morning. Kids filing out of the bus like noisy animals. Sophia keeping her head down. Hoping today might be different. It wasn’t.

“Move, Sofa,” a boy muttered, nudging her with his backpack.

“Did your mom dress you in the dark again?” a girl asked, snickering. 

Two more girls chimed in with a sing-songy, “Soooo-faaa, Soooo-faaa,”

as if her name were a joke meant for everyone but her.

Sophia wanted to disappear. Wanted to melt into the floor. Wanted to be anywhere else.

At lunch she ate alone behind a pillar in the courtyard. No one sat with her. No one looked for her. But she could hear the whispers.

“Pathetic”

“Weird”

“Sofa”

The words clung to her all the way home. She didn’t cry this time. She didn’t even feel sad. She felt… charged. Like a firework about to explode. She dropped her backpack by the door and went straight upstairs.

“Homework?” her mom called from the kitchen.

“Later,” Sophia said, closing the office door behind her.

She sat at the computer, fingers trembling with something she couldn’t name. Not fear, not anger, something colder and more controlled.

She double-clicked the green icon.

**FREEW!LL™**

The music started.

The grid-loaded town appeared.

Her finger hovered over the “Load Game” button like she was about to uncover something sacred.

When her household flickered into view, she leaned in close. James’s needs panel flashed red. Especially the bladder bar. He was trying to walk toward the bathroom. 

Sophia giggled softly. She clicked “Cancel Action.”

James stopped.

He tried again.

She canceled it.

He froze. Confusion flickered across the little digital man’s face.

Again.

Again.

**Again.**

Sophia cancelled every attempt he made.

And her giggle turned into a quiet, delighted laugh.

She didn’t feel bad. Not even a little.

For once in her life, she wasn’t the one being pushed around. 

She was the one pushing.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It happens on a Tuesday.  
Three days after the pool… thing.  
Three days of my friends insisting I “panicked,” while I pretend to believe them.

The house feels tense. Too quiet. Like it’s waiting.

We’re all in the living room. James is flipping through TV channels, Natalie is folding laundry, Ashley is sketching in her notebook. It should be normal. It almost is.

Then James stands up. Takes a few steps toward the hallway. And stiffens. It’s subtle at first, just a small tightening in his shoulders. I only notice because he sucks in a sharp breath through his teeth, like a sudden cramp grabbed him.

“You okay?” I ask.

He blinks hard.  
“Yeah… yeah, I just need to…”

He jerks his chin toward the hallway where the bathroom is. Except he doesn’t move. He stays rooted to the spot, eyes flicking in the direction he wants to go…but his feet don’t follow.

“James?” Natalie asks, standing up. “Do you need help?”

He shakes his head quickly.  
“I’m fine, I just…”

And then he freezes. Not hesitating. Freezes.

For one impossible second he looks like a paused video: arms lowered, head angled slightly, body locked. A beat later, he gasps. A small, strangled sound. His knees buckle. A dark stain spreads rapidly across the front of his khaki shorts, pooling at his feet, running down onto the rug in a thin, shimmering stream.

Natalie’s mouth lays wide open as her jaw drops. Ashley’s sketchbook slips from her fingers.

“Holy shit…” he whispers. “I… I don’t know what happened. I didn’t… I swear I couldn’t…” James stares down at himself, face blazing red.

He isn’t drunk. He isn’t sick. He isn’t laughing. He’s terrified.

I take a step toward him, but he backs away, mortified.

“I’m sorry,” he keeps saying. “I’m so sorry, I don’t know what that was, I’m sorry…”

“It’s okay,” I tell him gently, even as my stomach twists.

Because I remember the pool. The way my own body refused to do what I told it. This feels the same. Like something deeper is broken.

James cleans up, showers and avoids eye contact for the rest of the night.

We all pretend it isn’t weird. But it’s the kind of weird that sticks to your ribs.

Over the next few days, things start happening. Strange things that cannot be ignored…but somehow we do…

Natalie walks straight into the wall at the end of the hallway one afternoon, cursing while rubbing her nose and insisting the bathroom door used to be “like… twelve feet to the left.” We laugh, but the way she keeps staring at the wall isn’t funny.

Ashley comes into the kitchen frowning and asks, “Where did all my canvases go?” She swears she left them stacked by the back door. We find them later that day neatly lined up in her room, exactly where she always keeps them, like they were never anywhere else.

James grabs his keys one morning, says he’s going to run a couple errands, and heads out to the car. I watch him from the window as he starts the engine…and then just sits there. Hands on the wheel. Radio glow on his face. Not moving.

Two hours later he comes back in talking about traffic and lines at the store and some lady at the checkout who “wouldn’t stop chatting,” as if he hadn’t just been idling in our driveway the entire time.

I’m too scared to tell James the truth.  
Too afraid he might say, “Yeah, you did something like that the other day, too.”

I’m terrified to treat any of it as real, so I keep calling them little glitches. Little stutters in our routines. Nothing more.

**Then Ashley… stops coming downstairs.**

At first it’s just Ashley being Ashley.  
She’ll vanish into her room for a few hours, painting until she forgets what time is. That’s normal. But by Wednesday night, I realize something. I haven’t actually seen her in a while.  Not since… maybe the weekend? Maybe longer? She’ll grab a mug, get distracted, wander off. Ashley once joked she lived off “coffee and paint fumes”.

We always laughed.

By Thursday morning, though, her door is shut.  
By Thursday night… still shut.

No bathroom breaks.  
No footsteps.  
No water running.

Just the scratch-scratch-scratch of a paintbrush dragging across canvas.

We knock.

“Ashley?” I call.

“Painting!” she chirps back.

Her voice sounds bright. Too bright. Almost rehearsed. So we let it go.

**Friday**

Morning:  
Still painting.

Afternoon:  
Still painting.

Evening:  
Still painting.

Her voice when she answers us is thinner now, clipped, a little breathless.  
She ignores lunch.  
Ignores dinner.  
Ignores us.

**Saturday morning.**

I stand at her door.

“Ashley, seriously… you need to give it a break.”

No answer.

Just a frantic flurry of brushstrokes.

“Ashley?”

A long pause.

Then, barely audible:

“Almost… done… don’t interrupt me…”

My chest tightens.

**Saturday afternoon.**

We hear pacing. Canvas being shifted. Brushes swishing. Her voice, low and ragged, muttering under her breath:

Not finished…not finished…not finished…

The turpentine smell fills the hallway, sharp enough to sting my eyes.

“We need to check on her,” James says.

He tries the doorknob.

It won’t turn.

Not stuck. Not obviously locked.

Just… non-responsive. Like the mechanism inside isn’t connected to anything real.

He puts his shoulder into it.  
Nothing.

I pull.  
Push.

Nothing.

It isn’t a stuck door. It isn’t a broken lock. The door itself is none responsive. 

It feels like a wall wearing a doorframe as a costume.

“Ashley!” James shouts.

Nothing but the dragging of a brush.

**Sunday.**

Then we hear it…

A thud…

We call 911.

The paramedics arrive and try the handle themselves.  
Same result. Same confusion.

One EMT reaches for a pry tool, lining it up with the frame.

And right then…Click.

The doorknob turns smoothly in his hand.

Like it has always been a normal, working door.

James and I look at each other. The EMT hesitates, then pushes the door open.

What we see on the other side doesn’t look like a bedroom.

It looks like a crime scene built out of art supplies.

Ashley is collapsed on the wooden floor just a few steps from her easel, like her body finally gave out mid-journey. Brushes are scattered around her in a loose halo, as if they fell right out of her fingers. Paint streaks her fingertips and forearms in chalky layers, old color dried beneath newer color, days of work baked onto her skin.

Her cheeks are sunken.  
Her lips are cracked.  
Her eyes are half-open but unfocused, staring past us at nothing.

The walls…

Dozens of canvases. All half-finished. All frantic.

An entire gallery of obsession.

Her pulse is weak.  
Thready.

The EMTs move fast.

“What’s her intake been the last few days?” one asks.

“Intake?” I echo, brain slow.

“Food, water, sleep,” he clarifies, already checking her vitals.

“I… I don’t know,” I stammer. “She hasn’t really eaten much this week. She kept getting distracted. She was painting a lot.”

The EMTs exchange a grim look.

“This isn’t dehydration,” one says quietly.  
“This looks like prolonged exhaustion. Malnutrition. Starvation.”

The word hits harder the longer it sits there.

Ashley hasn’t been dieting.  
Hasn’t been sick.

She just… stopped eating.  
Stopped sleeping.  
Stopped doing anything but painting

Almost like she hadn’t been allowed to do anything else.

They wheel her out on a stretcher. Her fingers are curled faintly, like she’s still holding a brush in some dream she can’t wake up from.

The sirens, like her pulse, fade down the street.

The three of us stand on the front lawn, shaking in the heavy quiet.

And something settles over me with a cold, awful clarity:

These aren’t random accidents.  
This isn’t grief.  
This isn’t stress.

The house is pulling our strings.  
Picking one of us at a time.  
Changing what we can do.

Deciding what we forget.  
Deciding what we remember.

Like it doesn’t think we’re people at all.

Just pieces.  
Just characters.  
Perfect for whatever game it’s playing.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*Earlier that week…*

Sophia didn’t bother pretending to do homework tonight. Not when the computer was right there. Not when she could feel the tingle of power in her fingertips. FREEW!LL loaded with its cheerful music. Bright. Bubbly. Innocent. Sophia wasn’t.

“Hey, Ashley… how are we doing today?” she said in a twinkle.

The game zoomed into Ashley’s bedroom, the one with the easel and the soft peach walls. Ashley paced irritably, hunger bar already low, fun bar empty, energy tanking.

Sophia had already been ignoring Ashley’s hunger bar for some time now.  
Only now it became more conscious.  
More deliberate.

Ashley walked toward the door. Sophia frowned.

She clicked the door. The menu appeared.

**Options:**

* **Lock Door (For Ashley)**
* **Lock Door (For Household)**
* **Lock Door (For Everyone)**
* **Delete**
* **Move**
* **Recolor**

Sophia hovered over the options for a second. A little electric rush ran through her fingers, then she clicked:

**Lock Door (For Household)**

A soft chime confirmed it.

Ashley tugged the door handle.  
It didn’t move.  
She tugged again, harder.

Sophia leaned forward, grinning.

“You’re not leaving.”

She knew it was wrong.  
She knew it in the same instinctive way you know a stove is hot.

But liking it came easier than guilt did.

**Day One: Confusion**

Ashley tried to walk to the kitchen.  
Sophia clicked Cancel Action.

Ashley reset, stomped her foot, then tried again.

Cancel.

Sophia smiled.

Then, almost as an afterthought, she clicked the easel.

Paint.

Ashley hesitated, then turned obediently toward the canvas.

Sophia felt a warm spark of satisfaction.

“Good. That’s better,” she whispered. “Do something useful.”

Ashley painted, but slowly.  
Her hunger bar dipped further.

She stopped to wave her arms in frustration.

Sophia canceled her protest.

Paint.

**Day Two: Obsession**

Sophia watched Ashley all the next afternoon after school.

A fresh bruise on her shoulder from the hallway shove throbbed dully, but she barely felt it. She was too busy clicking, watching, controlling.

Ashley moved toward the door.  
**Cancel.**

Ashley tried to nap.  
**Cancel.**

Ashley tried to whimper on the floor.  
**Cancel.**

Sophia selected Paint.

Ashley dragged herself to the easel.

“She’s such a baby,” Sophia muttered. “It’s just hunger. People don’t need to eat so much.”

This was a lie.  
But Sophia liked these lies.

Something flickered…A feeling that had lived in her long before the game. Long before the name “Sofa Sophia”. Long before the neighborhood kids found the two dead rabbits under her family’s couch during a birthday party, dissected and mangled like a science project gone wrong. Long before she pretended she didn’t know how they got there, or why they looked the way they did. 

But this time, she didn’t push that feeling away.

She Let it wrap around her like a warm blanket.

Let it rinse through her until the guilt went quiet.

She lifted her chin, eyes narrowing at the monitor.

She glared back at her tiny trapped character with something that looked a lot like satisfaction.

**Day Three: Decay**

Ashley’s needs panel was a graveyard of red bars.

Hunger: Flashing.  
Energy: Empty.  
Hygiene: Red.  
Fun: Rock bottom.  
Comfort: Zero.

Ashley staggered away from the easel toward the bathroom door, moving on instinct more than choice.

Again.

Sophia clicked.

Cancel.

Ashley stopped mid-step, body snapping back to the easel like a rubber band.

This time, Sophia didn’t just cancel the action. She flipped into Build Mode and zoomed in. The toilet. The shower.

**Click. Delete. Gone.**

“Ash,” she said in a scolding voice, “you’re not done yet.”

She clicked Paint.

Ashley trudged back.

Her animation stuttered slightly, a glitch.  
Her shoulders twitched.  
Her head moved a fraction too slow.

Sophia stared at the twitching frame with fascination.

“Wow,” she whispered. Her smile widened.

**Day Four: Begging**

Ashley fell to the floor.

Not a sleep animation. Not rest. A collapse.

Her hands trembled as she crawled toward the door, face twisting in a silent scream. The hunger bar beeped and pulsed, each flash weaker than the last.

Sophia leaned forward.

“Ashley…” she whispered mockingly, “you’re not listening.”

She selected Paint.

Ashley struggled up, movement slow, terrible.

She reached the easel, grabbed the brush with a shaking hand, and smeared paint in desperate, chaotic strokes.

Sophia felt a shiver of pleasure.

“You do what I say,” she murmured.

**Day Five: Collapse**

Ashley’s body glitched again.  
Faltered.  
Paused mid-animation.

She turned in a half-circle that never fully completed, then slumped to her knees. The hunger bar drained to nothing. A soft system chime played.

**Pling.**

Ashley lay still beside the easel, face pale, eyes empty, fingers curled like she was still trying to hold a brush.

Sophia stared at the screen.

She didn’t breathe for a moment.

Then a slow, dark smile crept across her face, one with nothing innocent left in it.

“I win,” she whispered.

And she felt something then.  
Something she’d never felt this sharply before.

Power.

But not just power.

Something inside her, something that had been growing quietly for years, finally matured. Not like a flower blooming in the spring, but like a patch of mold that had finally spread too far to scrub away, revealing the full infestation underneath. The feeling washed over her, warm and electric.

Not guilt. Not fear.

Satisfaction. Control.

She leaned forward, staring at the motionless body on the screen…watching with glee as the little EMT characters came on screen and whisked her lifeless body away as they always did when a character hit zero…

You want to ensure you choose a setup that is not only easy to use but also delivers delicious results. By exploring various brewing methods, you can find one that suits your taste and lifestyle, enhancing your outdoor experience. In this guide, you'll learn how to assess your options and pick the best brewing setup, so you can enjoy great coffee under the stars.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
 * Choose a brewing method based on ease of use and personal preference, such as pour-over, French press, or instant coffee.
 * Consider necessary equipment like a portable kettle, grinder, and appropriate coffee beans for the best flavor.
 * Practice your brewing technique at home before heading out to ensure a smooth camping experience.

UNDERSTANDING THE BASICS
Your brewing experience begins with a solid foundation in the vitals of coffee. From understanding bean variety to mastering extraction methods, knowing the basics allows you to craft the perfect cup. Start by familiarizing yourself with coffee terminology, such as grind size and brewing time. Recognizing how these factors influence flavor will set you apart as an informed brew master, enhancing your backyard coffee ritual.

CHOOSING THE RIGHT COFFEE BEANS
Selecting the right coffee beans has a significant impact on your final brew. Consider choosing whole beans for fresher flavor; look for single-origin options or blends that suit your palate. Medium roasts offer a balanced flavor profile, making them ideal for newcomers wanting to explore different taste notes without overwhelming bitterness. Don't shy away from asking for recommendations at your local coffee shop.

SELECTING THE APPROPRIATE BREWING METHOD
Your choice of brewing method should align with your skill level and desired flavor profile. For instance, if you prefer simplicity, instant coffee or a French press may be your best bets.

**Memory transcription subject: Narini**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 18, 2136*

I ducked down another alleyway, trying to look inconspicuous. The exterminators hadn't figured me out yet, but I was starting to think was better to leave early before they put too much together. Honestly, all this subtle stuff was stressing me out.

""Hey, check it out! A new poster!"" I heard a young male remark as I kept walking slowly. He and his friends were looking at one of the pieces I had put up in the early morning hours. Brushing past him, I slipped a small flier into his pack. This one had a code that could be scanned. It was the seventh such flier I had passed off today.

Around the corner was a bar that I had visited the night before. The owner was a cousin of mine, and I had discretely left some other fliers in the lavatories, using others as impromptu coasters. I slipped inside and made my way to the bar.

""Hi Sish, how's it going tonight?""

""Good to see you again, Narini. I assume you want your usual?"" He set down a glass with two ice chips in it, his ear flicking to the left. I glanced over and saw a pair of dossur at one of the tables having a very animated conversation.

The ice cubes meant they were exterminators.

""I think I might try something different tonight.""

""Hmmmm... well, this may work for you..."" Sish poured water in my glass, adding a few drops of coloring to it to make it look like spirits. I thanked him and slid down to the end of the bar, closest to the exterminator table.

""So, did you check out that network address from the poster the other day?"" the male asked.

""I did. There was a bunch of horrible stuff. If even half of it is true..."" the female responded.

""Then we're on the wrong side.""

I knew the address they were talking about. It was a forum where dossur could post their stories anonymously. Honestly I was still amazed that Tempest had set it up so quickly. I was even more surprised at how quickly other stories were popping up.

""What do you think we should do, Cinta?""

""I honestly don't know...""

I turned on my data pad and made as if I was fixing the fur on the top of my head. What I was really doing was taking pictures over my shoulder. A few taps, and the images were sent to Tempest. After that, all I had to do was wait. I took the time to order some actual food for myself.

My human friend didn't keep me waiting long. In fact I had barely started eating when I heard a <""PING!""> behind me. The female exterminator fumbled her data pad and gasped. ""What the stars?"" she exclaimed dropping the pad as if it were burning her.

""What? What is it, Ginga?""

""Somehow... my swift pair app opened on its own...""

""That is strange.""

""It gets stranger"" the female said. I turned my head a little, as 'Ginga' turned her pad around to show 'Cinta'. On the screen was a human, half hidden in shadows, the corners of her mouth turned up in a smile, with a dark finger in front of it. It was a face I had come to know quite well.

""Hello, little exterminators...""

**Memory transcription subject: Justin ""Mike"" Martin, Rheinmetall-America**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 18, 2136*

I hadn't even finished half my morning coffee when a self-identified spook contacted me, and wanted very detailed prints of the Panzer-X. The whole thing felt like a trap, so I declined on principal and notified our anti-espionage unit. That was four hours ago.

Two hours ago, the Director of Engineering and the division president herself came to see me. Both were pale faced, and gave me very specific instructions that I would be getting a call from someone called 'gearhead', and that I should give the caller everything asked.

When phone rang and I looked at it incredulously. ""Rheinmetall, How may I help you?""

*""Uhm... hello?""*

""Yes... how may I help you?""

""*Uhm, I'm trying to reach my friend Mike?""* The voice was small, high pitched, but I thought I recognized it. I needed to test it, wishing against all hope.

""And my I ask who's calling?*""* I asked, sipping my afternoon coffee

*""Gearhead.""* I almost choked. *""I don't know his full name, but... he goes by 'Tanks4Tanking' in Lightning Conflict""*

I could feel the smile spreading across my face ""Well, my little furry friend, isn't this a surprise. I hadn't expected you to be my mysterious client.""

*""Oh, thank the stars!""* There was a brief pause, then my dossur friend continued. ""*Mike, I have a huge favor to ask.""*

""Let me guess... drawings and specs for a tank?""

*""One day you will have to tell me how you always know what I'm thinking.""*

""No super-powers in this case, I got a heads-up from a spook. Can you confirm the tank's serial number?""

*""Pz-X 412391""* 

I quickly typed the serial number into our ERP system, calling up both the spec sheet and the unit particulars. ""Got it. Konig Lowe, heavy battle tank. Combat weight is about seventy eight and a half tonnes. Twelve cylinder turbo-diesel hybrid with lithium iron phosphate battery array. One hundred thirty five millimeter main gun. Looks like you have the Dominator package on it, with three machine guns, three laser balls, and a whole bunch of electronic goodies.""

*""That sounds impressive""*

""It is. The Konig Lowe is one of the finest war machines ever built. I'd put it against any other human machine short of the big land-cruisers."" I took a deep breath. ""Not sure what you can do with it though. It normally takes a crew of five humans to operate, and last I checked dossur were a lot smaller than us.""

*""I have some ideas, but I don't know how practical they are.""*

""Ok, shoot?"" I leaned back in my chair, grabbing my stress-ball and tossing it idly.

*""Well, with enough dossur we can figure out how to drive it...""* I had the comical image of a dozen squirrels pushing and pulling on levers and pedals as another one yelled orders to them. It was difficult to stifle my laughter as Sawil continued *""I was thinking I could adapt my Lightning Conflict interface to aiming the gun.""*

""It's possible, though it would be best to have you talk to one of our bit-freaks. This isn't a video game you're trying to hack.""

*""Sure.""*

""How are you going to load the gun? The Konig Lowe doesn't have an auto-loader, and there's no way even a crew of dossur can handle a thirty kilogram shell.""

*""That's why I need the drawings. I want to build a loading machine, but I need to know where I can connect it in.""*

I closed my eyes, trying to mentally envisage it. There was a reason that even in the twenty second century, most designers still used a human loader. The system would need to extract the shell from the magazine, flip it over, drop it into the loading cradle, ram it into the breach, and then get rid of the spent casing so it could start all over again. ""And you're going to do all this yourself?""

*""I believe the last time I asked you that question, you said that I should just sit back and watch...""*

I was taking a walk around my neighborhood, and one of my neighbors who has been friendly to me in the past, had his garage door open and had some sort of deer hanging upside down, and he was cutting it up. I was immediately shocked, as people don’t typically behave like this where I came from, and if they do, they are certainly not open about it.

I have even heard a few openly boasting about going hunting and the animals they killed. However, this really hit close to home, I didn’t realize people in my neighborhood could be so violent.

I am considering organizing a community committee who are willing to fight for changes restricting public displays of this backwards “tradition”.

I know there are still some Indian tribes that rely on hunting to feed themselves and their tribe, of course I fully support these indigenous communities. However nobody living in a modern city, like Missoula should be engaging in these practices.

I was just traveling through Romania last summer, doing the classic “cheap Eastern Europe loop,” and the plan was literally two nights in Bucharest then back to Greece. Fast forward eight months and I’m still here. No clue how that happened. The first thing that got me was the prices. Coming from Greece, Romania felt like someone secretly turned on a discount mode. Coffee for like 8–12 lei? Hell yes. A normal meal that doesn’t cost half your paycheck? Even better. I’m not saying everything is cheap, but damn, compared to Greece, it hits different. Rent was the biggest surprise. I was paying 400 euro for a shoebox back home. Here I’m at like 280 for a place that actually has walls that don’t shake when someone breathes too loudly. The downside is you gotta hunt for decent landlords because some of them operate like mini-dictatorships. Transport is kinda a mixed bag. Buses and metro? Cheap and easy. Taxis? Also cheap if you don’t pick the shady ones. But cars… brother… the roads will make you reconsider all your life choices. Potholes that could eat an entire wheel. I swear Romania invented a unique suspension test. Food though? Solid. Pastries everywhere. Homemade stuff. Markets with actual produce instead of plastic-looking tomatoes that taste like stress. And nobody judges you for eating sarmale at weird hours. Good people. Downsides? Bureaucracy hits you like a truck. Want anything official? Pack snacks. You’ll be there all day. Also the winters slapped me harder than I expected. Greece spoiled me. But honestly, the vibe is good. People mind their business but help you when you actually need it. Cost of living lets you breathe a little. And there’s this weird charm in the chaos that kinda grows on you.

I complied 100% but then calmly asked her name. She replied, “Shakira, do you want me to write it on a napkin for you? I calmly said “no thanks, I got it” I calmly walked up front and mentioned this rude person to the male Purser and all he said was “I did not witness it so I cannot comment on it.” So he basically cared not. I plan to complain and get my Skypesos but this crew also held up the start of the boarding process for 20 minutes for no other reason than it was early and they were tired. When the airplane stopped in Atlanta the two crew members never stood up and gave their thumbs up through the window from their jumpseat. Finally when all the nearby passengers were standing and after the door was opened they finally stood up and said,” oh we better get out of the way”

1. The main character is a man, living in an apartment in a multi-story building.
2. A young woman moves in with him — there’s a romantic subplot.
3. They sometimes **walk in a line “like a goose” in a crouched / squatting position** in the apartment and on the street, so the landlady doesn’t notice. The final scene shows them walking in a line on a highway, holding hands.
4. The main character was threatened with **eviction for not paying rent**.
5. There’s a scene where he **spills coffee on his crotch**, starts adjusting his clothes, and bystanders think he’s masturbating.
6. In some scenes, he **enters the apartment via scaffolding / “goat-like” ladders**.
7. There’s a dinner scene: a man and woman come over, and the woman suddenly **falls ill**.
8. In the climax, **all the residents of the building gather outside the main character’s apartment** intending to harm him, but he unknowingly joins the crowd, not realizing they came for him.
9. The movie has a **crazy, absurd, Mr. Bean-like style**.

**Additional info:**

* Probably made in **Eastern Europe** (Poland, Czech Republic, former Yugoslavia, Russia/Ukraine).
* Released sometime between **1985–2005**.

Maybe its because I'm still getting used to life here and trying to make new friends, etc., but the memories from last year already feel so painfully nostalgic.

Just before I moved, I officially ended things with a guy I was seeing for about 6 months that had no clear direction. Basically at the start of us seeing each other I told him I really liked him and he told me he wasn't ready for a relationship, so from then on I emotionally distanced myself from him while still going out to do things together/hooking up. We hung out for several months after that and always had a great time. I honestly lost romantic feelings for him, and it felt more like a romantic friendship if that makes sense. But one of my favorite things about him was that things were always light, and we laughed a lot together.

So a couple of months ago I invite him out for coffee to catch up. I had been distancing myself from him the whole summer, because I knew that while I enjoyed his company, I ultimately wanted something more serious. So over coffee, we voice eveything we never said to each other. I tell him my truth, that I loved our time together but I ultimately want more and need to end things before I go. He reciprocates the feelings but agrees this is for the best. During this conversation, he actually tells me that he was talking to two other women while we were hanging out, and he says they both ended things with him in the same two week time frame I ended things with him. So he said this conversation was painful but it was a wake up call for him on the way he is approaching dating, etc. I think this piece of information was the most affirming thing for me that I was making the right decision. We could have talked for longer but in my gut I knew I had to cut the conversation off at some point. Despite all this, the conversation ended on a really good note and we walked away smiling and wishing each other well. It felt like a breakup to be honest. I think about texting him from time to time, but I know that this is best left in the past.

Even though I know he isn't my person, he is one of those people who just makes a lasting impact on you. When I think back to my time last year, I have a lot of fond memories exploring the city with him. I'm proud of myself for ending it, but it's just a bit painful sometimes.

Thanks for taking the time to read this!

I am based on the east coast but am a frequent business traveler to SF, coming to town monthly for 4-5 day stints including some weekend stopovers.  I will next be in town Dec 3-7.  I can host in my upscale downtown hotel.

I’m here often enough that I’d like to find a local connection - something easy and without strings.  I’d love to find someone I can be flirty and playful with.  I’d love to grab coffee or a cocktail, or enjoy a dinner date.  Maybe check out a weekend market or go on a hike? 

Something fun where we can hang out, flirt, and see where things go without feeling forced or rushed.  I’m someone who likes to build playful tension and release it explosively when the time’s right.

Physically: I am tall (6ft4 - come climb me like a tree!) and in decent shape.  I’m no gym rat but I do regular bootcamp style exercises.  I’m handsome and well put together.  I am well endowed but won’t assault your eyes with unwelcome anatomical photographs.  

Personality: I’m an educated professional, normal, sane, and respectful of your time and your boundaries.  I’m kind, easy-going, funny, and quick to smile.  I’m playful and flirty.

Interests: Outside of work I’m a traveler who takes several international trips every year. I’ve visited over forty countries and love being outside of my element. I am an experienced home chef and love spending time in the kitchen. I hike and bike. I love drinking bourbon next to a campfire.

Bedroom stuff: I am drug, drama, and disease free and ask that you be also - especially the drama and disease part.  I’m 420 friendly.  I’m not too concerned about your personal situation, we’re all adults here and I’m not looking to be indiscreet with whatever you may have sensitivities about.

I’m into both vanilla connections and kinky ones. I am very sex positive and kink-friendly, so articulate your needs and curiosities without hesitation or shame. I try to be a walking safe space, respectful of boundaries. I get the most sexual satisfaction from my partner having a great time.

Let’s take this online, shall we? If this post caught your attention, please send me a chat and tell me about yourself and what caught your eye. Can’t wait to connect.",1,1764964157.0,polyamoryR4R,1,1.0,False

1pf4o9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1pf4o9u/anxiety_and_vyvanse/,Anxiety and vyvanse,"Sorry i feel like this gets asked a lot but im just looking for people who have been in a similar situation to me.

I am an anxiety sufferer and have been on antidepressants for a long time. Im currently on 30mg fluoxetine (prozac) and I was recently diagnosed with adhd and started taking 30mg vyvanse and it has been great. but I felt it didn't last long enough. So my psych upped my dose to 50mg and my first day was even better, but.. now after a week of taking it i almost dread it. My anxiety has sky rocketed and im more tired than ever. The first couple of hours after taking the vyvanse are good, I can feel it building up but so is my anxiety. And I then I start having these burn outs every 30-60 minutes and feeling depressed and tired. It's like i get so hyped up and then bang, i crash feeling hopeless and depressed. And this does nothing for my adhd, even possibly makes it work.

I am also a big coffee drinker which I know of course isn't ideal. I have cut back on coffee and only have 1 very early in the morning, and I don't think I could ever quit completely. 

I gather the 50mg is too high a dose. But im just worried ill never find that sweet spot. My next psychiatrist appointment is 3 months away and im thinking about tipping a bit of the capsule powder out so its around 40mg.

We came up with fun names and looked to paired them with recipes, which I know is a little backwards. 

I'm not a mixologist in any way so all I've had is my Google searching to guide me. I loved the idea of a drink called the Seamripper and I wanted to think of something that you might make for yourself after you've just accidentally sewn both sleeves to the wrong sides of the shirt and now the perfectly-matched thread must be carefully picked out of your irreplaceable fabric. 

My best idea so far is a Revolver (you need that coffee because it's like 2am the night before the event) but maybe add chocolate bitters or something? 

Our other drinks are 
the French Curve: basically a Kir Royale with a little dark rum; 
the Sandblaster: a tajin-rimmed paloma; 
and the Mold Star®: a berry Jell-O shot with vodka and Curaçao.

1pf4lav,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1pf4lav/dating_going_quite_well_but_i_am_still_confused/,dating: going quite well but i am still confused,"I (24M) met someone at a party (23F) and we had a chat, and then she asked me out to have a cup of coffee. We have since then been on 4 dates in 2 weeks, and we've spent 6 hours or more together on like each of those dates. I really like being with her and I'm assuming she does too, as she's willing to spend hours with me and also suggests new things we could together. 

But the thing is I'm so lost on how to escalate romantically. In our 3rd date we watched a movie at her flat and I managed to get quite close to her, pretty much leaning against her, but still no arm around her or anything like that, and on our last date that we went on a walk in the park after dinner and we lied down (again quite close to eachother) and looked at the stars and stuff for a long while. Now when I was talking with my friend about this his immediate reaction was a frustrated ""dude why didn't you kiss her?!"". But like the moment was so perfect, all I wanted was to enjoy the moment, I thought of it, but I didn't want to ruin the moment. Even though I'm quite confident she likes me (women tend to in my experience make it relatively clear if they only see you as a friend), I am lost on how to let HER know I like her, on one hand I'm afraid of appearing lustful, on the other hand I'm afraid if I don't do something soon she'll start to think I'm not interested.

Do I just ask to kiss her when the moment is right? Put my arm around her or something? Or just tell her with words? I'm really figuring this out as I go here.",3,1764963731.0,AutisticAdults,1,1.0,False

I ended up following some backroads and somehow landed in this small village I’d never even heard of. Nothing famous, no tourists, nothing “Instagram”, just quiet and cheap and weirdly relaxing. Bought a coffee for like 10 lei, grabbed a pastry that tasted way better than anything in the city, and just walked around for a bit. Every person I passed said hello like they knew me. It felt like stepping into a different timeline where life isn’t rushing all the time. It made me wonder how many little places like this exist across the Balkans that nobody talks about because they’re not “destinations”, but they’re actually perfect if you’re broke and just want a day away from noise. Anyone else have tiny random spots they go to that cost almost nothing but feel like a mini vacation?

1pf4flf,https://v.redd.it/jxvmv6c2uf5g1,I built an AI video generator that turns scripts into lip-synced avatar videos — here's what 3 months of work looks like,"Hey everyone 👋

I've been working on this with my team at Mindsight Ventures for the past few months and wanted to share where we're at.

**The problem we're solving:**

Creating video content is a pain. You either need to be on camera (not everyone's thing), hire someone, or spend hours learning Premiere/DaVinci. We wanted to make it as simple as: write script → get video.

**What it does:**

* You write or paste a script
* Pick an AI voice (we have multiple languages and accents)
* Choose an avatar presenter
* The system generates a lip-synced video of that avatar delivering your script
* Then you can edit it in our studio — including AI-powered frame editing (you can literally type ""remove the coffee cup"" and it does it)

**The tech stack (for the nerds):**

Next.js + Node backend, Remotion for programmatic video rendering, various AI models for TTS, lip-sync, and image editing. Postgres + blob storage. The rendering is the tricky part — video generation can take a while so we had to think carefully about the architecture.

**Where we are:**

Still in Alpha. We're doing videos on-demand right now for a small group while we stress-test everything. Opening up a private beta soon.

**What I'd love feedback on:**

* Does this solve a real problem for you?
* What video types would you actually use this for?
* Any features that seem missing?

--- Story ---

Chapter 1
1

My CEO husband’s new assistant was a walking disaster.

Today, she decided to have a barbecue. In the sterile cleanroom lab. My three-billion-dollar project, instantly contaminated.

She just bit her lip, tears welling in her big, innocent eyes.

""I'm so sowwy, Rhiannon. Poppy just wanted to help you celebrate!"" she whined, referring to herself in the third person. ""Even if the project is ruined, we can still have our party, right? I'm still your favorite little helper, aren't I?""

My husband, Leo, wrapped a protective arm around her.

""It's only three billion,"" he said, glaring at me. ""Stop being so petty, Rhiannon. Consider it tuition for Poppy's learning experience."" He waved a dismissive hand at the wreckage. ""Besides, that dead-end research of yours was going nowhere. It's time you shut down the lab and went home to be a good little trophy wife.""

I had to wonder why he was so nonchalant about a three-billion-dollar project going up in smoke.

And then it hit me. He thought it was my project.

I started to laugh and clap my hands slowly. Oh, this was good. This was very good. It wasn't my company on the verge of bankruptcy.

...

Leo's brow furrowed at my reaction. ""What are you laughing at, Rhiannon? Don't think I don't know what that smug look means.""

""You're just bitter about the money,"" he sneered. ""But let's be honest, that project was a drain. You should be thanking Poppy for putting it out of its misery.""

Poppy peeked out from behind his arm. ""The lab just felt so cold and boring, Rhiannon. Poppy just wanted to liven things up a little! I didn't know your experiments were so… fragile. It was an accident!""

I laughed out loud. ""Poppy, you're twenty-two, not two. Drop the baby act.""

I surveyed the catastrophic mess. For five years of marriage, I had cleaned up countless messes for Leo's projects. I’d put my own research on hold to help him analyze his data. He only saw me as a frumpy, overworked scientist who left early and came home late. He had no idea that a top-tier tech firm was on the verge of signing a massive deal to acquire my research.

Seeing my expression harden, Leo stepped in front of Poppy protectively.

""That's enough, Rhiannon! How long are you going to drag this out? It was only three billion dollars. A cheap price to pay for Poppy's education, if you ask me!"" He scoffed. ""And your gene therapy research was a joke anyway. Just a money pit with nothing to show for it. Now that it's gone, you can finally give up!""

Behind him, Poppy shot me a triumphant, smug smirk.

Fine. If Leo wasn't worried about his own project being destroyed, why should I be?

I turned to leave, but he grabbed my arm and spun me around.

""Apologize to Poppy.""

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. ""She destroyed a three-billion-dollar project, and you want me to apologize to her? Leo, have you forgotten who your wife is?""

He let out a derisive snort. ""If you hadn't built your lab in the company headquarters, Poppy never would have gone in there. If you weren't such a miserable shrew all the time, she wouldn't have felt the need to cheer you up. This is your fault, Rhiannon. You're going to apologize, and then you're going to pay her one million dollars for emotional distress.""

His company's capital was already stretched thin because of this project. Now, with a three-billion-dollar loss and massive breach-of-contract penalties looming, he wanted to give his ""Poppy"" a million-dollar bonus?

Fine by me. Let the whole damn ship sink. I'll watch from my lifeboat.

""One million? No problem,"" I said breezily, pulling out a corporate financial approval form. ""Just sign here, Mr. CEO.""

Leo scowled. ""It's your company paying. Why would I sign?""

I spun a quick lie. ""New bank regulations. Any large corporate transfer requires signatures from both spouses to prevent fraudulent asset shifting.""

He eyed me with suspicion, but Poppy was already tugging at his arm.

""Leo, honey, please sign it! Poppy wants to go shopping for new bags!"" she cooed. ""Rhiannon's company is about to go bankrupt. If we wait too long, there might not be any money left!""

The doubt in Leo's eyes evaporated, replaced by impatience. He scribbled his name on the form, threw it in my face, and swept out of the lab with Poppy on his arm.

I looked at his clear, confident signature and smiled.

I hoped he enjoyed this feeling of power. It wouldn't last long. Not when he discovered his company's bank account had a balance of two hundred and fifty dollars.

I went straight to the finance department. The CFO turned pale when he saw the form.

""Ms. Thorne, are you sure about this transfer?"" he stammered. ""We've poured every last drop of liquid capital into this project. There isn't a million dollars in cash flow!""

I took a slow sip of my coffee. ""Mr. Thorne personally approved it. Can't you see his signature?""

The CFO wiped sweat from his brow. ""But… if this goes through, we won't be able to make payroll next month. The employees will riot.""

I shrugged. ""That sounds like a problem for your CEO. Not me.""

He didn't dare argue. With a trembling hand, he processed the transfer.

The next day, as I was packing up my personal data reports from the lab, Poppy burst in. She triumphantly dropped a dozen luxury shopping bags on the table.

""Look what Leo bought me!"" she chirped. ""He said I was so brave yesterday and deserved a treat."" She dangled a limited-edition handbag in front of my face. ""Isn't it pretty? So hard to get.""

She smirked. ""Such a shame your company is going bankrupt, Rhiannon. Soon you won't even be able to afford the knock-offs.""

Leo stood beside her, arms crossed, the picture of arrogance. ""It's my money. I'll spend it how I want. Don't be so bitter, Rhiannon. You're nothing now.""

I looked up at him, my gaze calm. ""We're not divorced yet. That's marital property you're spending.""

Leo laughed and threw a document at my face. ""Your project's debts are your own. Don't try to pin them on me! I'm being generous by letting you stay on as Mrs. Thorne. Otherwise, you'll be a laughingstock in this entire industry.""

I picked up the document. It was a property settlement agreement. Everything in his name—the house, the cars, his company shares—would remain his. My project, and all its debt, would generously be left to me.

He really had it all figured out.

I looked at him and smiled. ""Leo, did you forget? I own shares in your company, too.""

His face darkened. ""Don't even think about it! Those were a gift. I can take them back anytime I want!""

I pushed the agreement back toward him. ""I'll sign. On two conditions. The house is mine—it was a wedding gift from my parents. And I want a divorce.""

Leo looked me up and down with contempt. ""A divorce? Did your brain get fried along with your project, Rhiannon? Sign my agreement, and I'll graciously give you a five-hundred-dollar monthly allowance to remain my wife.""

Poppy chimed in, her voice sickly sweet. ""And Leo said he's making me the new Vice President! I can talk to him about giving you a job cleaning the toilets. How about that, Rhiannon?""

I almost laughed in their faces.

""Just answer the question, Leo. Are you going to grant me a divorce, or not?""

He scoffed, his tone magnanimous. ""Of course! Go ahead and take the house. It's not even worth as much as a few of Poppy's handbags.""

He eagerly signed the divorce papers.

With his signed settlement in hand, I went straight to my office.

""Get the legal team on the phone. We're filing for divorce,"" I told my assistant. ""And then, contact our broker. Sell all thirty percent of my shares in Thorne Industries. I want to see that stock price hit rock bottom.""

Leo seemed to have forgotten that I had used my parents' trust fund to get his project off the ground. Those shares weren't a gift. They were a legally binding investment.

On the day of my big signing ceremony, the newly appointed VP Poppy decided to make her mark. She gathered all the senior executives in the lobby for an impromptu meeting.

""Poppy is VP now, and Poppy is going to create value!"" she announced. ""Poppy feels so bad about ruining Rhiannon's project, so Poppy decided to bring in a new three-hundred-billion-dollar investment to make up for it!""

As I approached, I could hear the executives fawning over her.

""Amazing, Ms. Poppy! Three hundred billion!""

""Mr. Thorne has a real eye for talent! With you here, the company is destined for greatness!""

Beaming from the praise, Poppy spotted me and dragged me into a fire escape stairwell. She slammed a document against my chest.

""Poppy found you a high-leverage investment deal! Just sign this, and your project will get three hundred billion dollars instantly!""

I glanced at it. It was a gambling agreement, a leveraged bet. As I turned to walk away, several of Leo’s cronies, the senior executives, blocked my path and pinned me down.

Poppy planted her stiletto heel on my chest, grinding it in. ""This is your big chance, Rhiannon. Don't be ungrateful!""

I struggled, my heart pounding. My life's work was about to be officially acquired, and this idiot was about to ruin everything.

""I won't sign it! This is illegal! I'm calling the police!""

Poppy slapped me hard across the face. ""Your project is a worthless piece of trash! Who do you think you are?""

The executives joined in, kicking and punching me. ""She's doing you a favor, Rhiannon!"" one of them grunted. ""You should be on your knees thanking her!""

Poppy smiled triumphantly. ""Remember that new bank rule you mentioned? Leo already signed his part. All we need now is your fingerprint, and the deal is done!""

My struggles were useless. They beat me until I was limp, kicking me in the face and ribs. In the chaos, Poppy used a small knife to slice my thumb, then pressed it onto the signature line of the agreement.

She held up the document for everyone to see. Only then did I get a clear look at it.

She had used Leo's contaminated thirty-billion-dollar project as the basis for a 100x leveraged bet.

I lay on the cold floor, bruised and bleeding, and started to laugh.

The idiot. Poppy the idiot. She had just turned Leo's thirty-billion-dollar loss into a three-hundred-billion-dollar debt.

It was hilarious.

Just then, one of the executives glanced at his watch. ""The signing ceremony is about to start!""

Poppy immediately let me go and rushed to meet Leo, who had just arrived. ""Leo, honey, let's go! I bet that top-tier tech firm is here to sign a deal for our project!""

I staggered to my feet. Leo saw me and didn't even bother to hide his disgust.

""You actually have the nerve to show your face here, Rhiannon? A signing ceremony of this caliber is out of your league. Is your bankrupt little company even invited? Or did you just come to see what real success looks like? Pay attention. You might learn something.""

He straightened his tie and strode confidently towards the stage.

The CEO of the tech firm, Mr. Hayes, had just stepped up to the podium. Leo rushed past him, his expression dripping with arrogance.

""Mr. Hayes,"" he said loudly. ""I hear you're interested in my project. Ready to sign? Let's talk terms. Anything less than a seventy-thirty split in my favor is a non-starter.""

Mr. Hayes stared at him for a second, then took a step back as if Leo had lost his mind.

A murmur went through the crowd of reporters.

Then, the large screen behind the stage lit up. Leo stared at it, then his gaze snapped to me as I walked towards the signing table, his face a mask of utter disbelief.",1,1764963223.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

You probably won’t read this, and I hope you never do. 
I’ve been thinking a lot about you lately.. like, all the time.

You’ll never fathom how many times you’ve crossed my mind since last December.

Loving you felt like the only thing I was ever supposed to do. It felt so right at one point... yet now, it’s all I wish to let go of. And god knows how much I’ve tried, but you’re everywhere. You’re on the roadside by the ******. You’re in the bike lanes, in the blue of every rainbow that follows a rainy morning (where I can’t even drink my coffee in peace without your silly smiling face popping into my head). You’re in my room at 3am when the pills don’t work. You’re in me. And I am so exhausted by all of this… by you, by me, and by all the roads you’ve walked down.

Sometimes I wonder if it would have been easier if I had just stayed silent and never told you what you meant to me. Maybe then I would’ve had more of you, your sweet words, your awfully warm glances, your “good morning”s and your “how are you today?”.

If only I could hold you one more time, look into your eyes, and tell you how nothing’s been the same without you… if only..

Love,
E

Chapter 1
1

My CEO husband’s new assistant was a walking disaster.

Today, she decided to have a barbecue. In the sterile cleanroom lab. My three-billion-dollar project, instantly contaminated.

She just bit her lip, tears welling in her big, innocent eyes.

""I'm so sowwy, Rhiannon. Poppy just wanted to help you celebrate!"" she whined, referring to herself in the third person. ""Even if the project is ruined, we can still have our party, right? I'm still your favorite little helper, aren't I?""

My husband, Leo, wrapped a protective arm around her.

""It's only three billion,"" he said, glaring at me. ""Stop being so petty, Rhiannon. Consider it tuition for Poppy's learning experience."" He waved a dismissive hand at the wreckage. ""Besides, that dead-end research of yours was going nowhere. It's time you shut down the lab and went home to be a good little trophy wife.""

I had to wonder why he was so nonchalant about a three-billion-dollar project going up in smoke.

And then it hit me. He thought it was my project.

I started to laugh and clap my hands slowly. Oh, this was good. This was very good. It wasn't my company on the verge of bankruptcy.

...

Leo's brow furrowed at my reaction. ""What are you laughing at, Rhiannon? Don't think I don't know what that smug look means.""

""You're just bitter about the money,"" he sneered. ""But let's be honest, that project was a drain. You should be thanking Poppy for putting it out of its misery.""

Poppy peeked out from behind his arm. ""The lab just felt so cold and boring, Rhiannon. Poppy just wanted to liven things up a little! I didn't know your experiments were so… fragile. It was an accident!""

I laughed out loud. ""Poppy, you're twenty-two, not two. Drop the baby act.""

I surveyed the catastrophic mess. For five years of marriage, I had cleaned up countless messes for Leo's projects. I’d put my own research on hold to help him analyze his data. He only saw me as a frumpy, overworked scientist who left early and came home late. He had no idea that a top-tier tech firm was on the verge of signing a massive deal to acquire my research.

Seeing my expression harden, Leo stepped in front of Poppy protectively.

""That's enough, Rhiannon! How long are you going to drag this out? It was only three billion dollars. A cheap price to pay for Poppy's education, if you ask me!"" He scoffed. ""And your gene therapy research was a joke anyway. Just a money pit with nothing to show for it. Now that it's gone, you can finally give up!""

Behind him, Poppy shot me a triumphant, smug smirk.

Fine. If Leo wasn't worried about his own project being destroyed, why should I be?

I turned to leave, but he grabbed my arm and spun me around.

""Apologize to Poppy.""

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. ""She destroyed a three-billion-dollar project, and you want me to apologize to her? Leo, have you forgotten who your wife is?""

He let out a derisive snort. ""If you hadn't built your lab in the company headquarters, Poppy never would have gone in there. If you weren't such a miserable shrew all the time, she wouldn't have felt the need to cheer you up. This is your fault, Rhiannon. You're going to apologize, and then you're going to pay her one million dollars for emotional distress.""

His company's capital was already stretched thin because of this project. Now, with a three-billion-dollar loss and massive breach-of-contract penalties looming, he wanted to give his ""Poppy"" a million-dollar bonus?

Poppy smiled triumphantly. ""Remember that new bank rule you mentioned? Leo already signed his part. All we need now is your fingerprint, and the deal is done!""

My struggles were useless. They beat me until I was limp, kicking me in the face and ribs. In the chaos, Poppy used a small knife to slice my thumb, then pressed it onto the signature line of the agreement.

She held up the document for everyone to see. Only then did I get a clear look at it.

She had used Leo's contaminated thirty-billion-dollar project as the basis for a 100x leveraged bet.

I lay on the cold floor, bruised and bleeding, and started to laugh.

The idiot. Poppy the idiot. She had just turned Leo's thirty-billion-dollar loss into a three-hundred-billion-dollar debt.

It was hilarious.

Just then, one of the executives glanced at his watch. ""The signing ceremony is about to start!""

Poppy immediately let me go and rushed to meet Leo, who had just arrived. ""Leo, honey, let's go! I bet that top-tier tech firm is here to sign a deal for our project!""

I staggered to my feet. Leo saw me and didn't even bother to hide his disgust.

""You actually have the nerve to show your face here, Rhiannon? A signing ceremony of this caliber is out of your league. Is your bankrupt little company even invited? Or did you just come to see what real success looks like? Pay attention. You might learn something.""

He straightened his tie and strode confidently towards the stage.

The CEO of the tech firm, Mr. Hayes, had just stepped up to the podium. Leo rushed past him, his expression dripping with arrogance.

""Mr. Hayes,"" he said loudly. ""I hear you're interested in my project. Ready to sign? Let's talk terms. Anything less than a seventy-thirty split in my favor is a non-starter.""

Mr. Hayes stared at him for a second, then took a step back as if Leo had lost his mind.

A murmur went through the crowd of reporters.

--- Story ---

Chapter 1
1

My CEO husband’s new assistant was a walking disaster.

Today, she decided to have a barbecue. In the sterile cleanroom lab. My three-billion-dollar project, instantly contaminated.

She just bit her lip, tears welling in her big, innocent eyes.

""I'm so sowwy, Rhiannon. Poppy just wanted to help you celebrate!"" she whined, referring to herself in the third person. ""Even if the project is ruined, we can still have our party, right? I'm still your favorite little helper, aren't I?""

My husband, Leo, wrapped a protective arm around her.

""It's only three billion,"" he said, glaring at me. ""Stop being so petty, Rhiannon. Consider it tuition for Poppy's learning experience."" He waved a dismissive hand at the wreckage. ""Besides, that dead-end research of yours was going nowhere. It's time you shut down the lab and went home to be a good little trophy wife.""

I had to wonder why he was so nonchalant about a three-billion-dollar project going up in smoke.

And then it hit me. He thought it was my project.

I started to laugh and clap my hands slowly. Oh, this was good. This was very good. It wasn't my company on the verge of bankruptcy.

...

Leo's brow furrowed at my reaction. ""What are you laughing at, Rhiannon? Don't think I don't know what that smug look means.""

""You're just bitter about the money,"" he sneered. ""But let's be honest, that project was a drain. You should be thanking Poppy for putting it out of its misery.""

Poppy peeked out from behind his arm. ""The lab just felt so cold and boring, Rhiannon. Poppy just wanted to liven things up a little! I didn't know your experiments were so… fragile. It was an accident!""

I laughed out loud. ""Poppy, you're twenty-two, not two. Drop the baby act.""

I surveyed the catastrophic mess. For five years of marriage, I had cleaned up countless messes for Leo's projects. I’d put my own research on hold to help him analyze his data. He only saw me as a frumpy, overworked scientist who left early and came home late. He had no idea that a top-tier tech firm was on the verge of signing a massive deal to acquire my research.

Seeing my expression harden, Leo stepped in front of Poppy protectively.

""That's enough, Rhiannon! How long are you going to drag this out? It was only three billion dollars. A cheap price to pay for Poppy's education, if you ask me!"" He scoffed. ""And your gene therapy research was a joke anyway. Just a money pit with nothing to show for it. Now that it's gone, you can finally give up!""

Behind him, Poppy shot me a triumphant, smug smirk.

Fine. If Leo wasn't worried about his own project being destroyed, why should I be?

I turned to leave, but he grabbed my arm and spun me around.

""Apologize to Poppy.""

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. ""She destroyed a three-billion-dollar project, and you want me to apologize to her? Leo, have you forgotten who your wife is?""

He let out a derisive snort. ""If you hadn't built your lab in the company headquarters, Poppy never would have gone in there. If you weren't such a miserable shrew all the time, she wouldn't have felt the need to cheer you up. This is your fault, Rhiannon. You're going to apologize, and then you're going to pay her one million dollars for emotional distress.""

His company's capital was already stretched thin because of this project. Now, with a three-billion-dollar loss and massive breach-of-contract penalties looming, he wanted to give his ""Poppy"" a million-dollar bonus?

Fine by me. Let the whole damn ship sink. I'll watch from my lifeboat.

""One million? No problem,"" I said breezily, pulling out a corporate financial approval form. ""Just sign here, Mr. CEO.""

Leo scowled. ""It's your company paying. Why would I sign?""

I spun a quick lie. ""New bank regulations. Any large corporate transfer requires signatures from both spouses to prevent fraudulent asset shifting.""

He eyed me with suspicion, but Poppy was already tugging at his arm.

""Leo, honey, please sign it! Poppy wants to go shopping for new bags!"" she cooed. ""Rhiannon's company is about to go bankrupt. If we wait too long, there might not be any money left!""

The doubt in Leo's eyes evaporated, replaced by impatience. He scribbled his name on the form, threw it in my face, and swept out of the lab with Poppy on his arm.

I looked at his clear, confident signature and smiled.

I hoped he enjoyed this feeling of power. It wouldn't last long. Not when he discovered his company's bank account had a balance of two hundred and fifty dollars.

I went straight to the finance department. The CFO turned pale when he saw the form.

""Ms. Thorne, are you sure about this transfer?"" he stammered. ""We've poured every last drop of liquid capital into this project. There isn't a million dollars in cash flow!""

I took a slow sip of my coffee. ""Mr. Thorne personally approved it. Can't you see his signature?""

The CFO wiped sweat from his brow. ""But… if this goes through, we won't be able to make payroll next month. The employees will riot.""

I shrugged. ""That sounds like a problem for your CEO. Not me.""

He didn't dare argue. With a trembling hand, he processed the transfer.

The next day, as I was packing up my personal data reports from the lab, Poppy burst in. She triumphantly dropped a dozen luxury shopping bags on the table.

""Look what Leo bought me!"" she chirped. ""He said I was so brave yesterday and deserved a treat."" She dangled a limited-edition handbag in front of my face. ""Isn't it pretty? So hard to get.""

She smirked. ""Such a shame your company is going bankrupt, Rhiannon. Soon you won't even be able to afford the knock-offs.""

Leo stood beside her, arms crossed, the picture of arrogance. ""It's my money. I'll spend it how I want. Don't be so bitter, Rhiannon. You're nothing now.""

I looked up at him, my gaze calm. ""We're not divorced yet. That's marital property you're spending.""

Leo laughed and threw a document at my face. ""Your project's debts are your own. Don't try to pin them on me! I'm being generous by letting you stay on as Mrs. Thorne. Otherwise, you'll be a laughingstock in this entire industry.""

I picked up the document. It was a property settlement agreement. Everything in his name—the house, the cars, his company shares—would remain his. My project, and all its debt, would generously be left to me.

He really had it all figured out.

I looked at him and smiled. ""Leo, did you forget? I own shares in your company, too.""

His face darkened. ""Don't even think about it! Those were a gift. I can take them back anytime I want!""

I pushed the agreement back toward him. ""I'll sign. On two conditions. The house is mine—it was a wedding gift from my parents. And I want a divorce.""

Leo looked me up and down with contempt. ""A divorce? Did your brain get fried along with your project, Rhiannon? Sign my agreement, and I'll graciously give you a five-hundred-dollar monthly allowance to remain my wife.""

Poppy chimed in, her voice sickly sweet. ""And Leo said he's making me the new Vice President! I can talk to him about giving you a job cleaning the toilets. How about that, Rhiannon?""

I almost laughed in their faces.

""Just answer the question, Leo. Are you going to grant me a divorce, or not?""

He scoffed, his tone magnanimous. ""Of course! Go ahead and take the house. It's not even worth as much as a few of Poppy's handbags.""

He eagerly signed the divorce papers.

With his signed settlement in hand, I went straight to my office.

""Get the legal team on the phone. We're filing for divorce,"" I told my assistant. ""And then, contact our broker. Sell all thirty percent of my shares in Thorne Industries. I want to see that stock price hit rock bottom.""

Leo seemed to have forgotten that I had used my parents' trust fund to get his project off the ground. Those shares weren't a gift. They were a legally binding investment.

On the day of my big signing ceremony, the newly appointed VP Poppy decided to make her mark. She gathered all the senior executives in the lobby for an impromptu meeting.

""Poppy is VP now, and Poppy is going to create value!"" she announced. ""Poppy feels so bad about ruining Rhiannon's project, so Poppy decided to bring in a new three-hundred-billion-dollar investment to make up for it!""

As I approached, I could hear the executives fawning over her.

""Amazing, Ms. Poppy! Three hundred billion!""

""Mr. Thorne has a real eye for talent! With you here, the company is destined for greatness!""

Beaming from the praise, Poppy spotted me and dragged me into a fire escape stairwell. She slammed a document against my chest.

""Poppy found you a high-leverage investment deal! Just sign this, and your project will get three hundred billion dollars instantly!""

I glanced at it. It was a gambling agreement, a leveraged bet. As I turned to walk away, several of Leo’s cronies, the senior executives, blocked my path and pinned me down.

Poppy planted her stiletto heel on my chest, grinding it in. ""This is your big chance, Rhiannon. Don't be ungrateful!""

I struggled, my heart pounding. My life's work was about to be officially acquired, and this idiot was about to ruin everything.

""I won't sign it! This is illegal! I'm calling the police!""

Poppy slapped me hard across the face. ""Your project is a worthless piece of trash! Who do you think you are?""

The executives joined in, kicking and punching me. ""She's doing you a favor, Rhiannon!"" one of them grunted. ""You should be on your knees thanking her!""

Poppy smiled triumphantly. ""Remember that new bank rule you mentioned? Leo already signed his part. All we need now is your fingerprint, and the deal is done!""

My struggles were useless. They beat me until I was limp, kicking me in the face and ribs. In the chaos, Poppy used a small knife to slice my thumb, then pressed it onto the signature line of the agreement.

She held up the document for everyone to see. Only then did I get a clear look at it.

The CEO of the tech firm, Mr. Hayes, had just stepped up to the podium. Leo rushed past him, his expression dripping with arrogance.

This is the practical guide: what to actually do when stress hits, how to prevent it from piling up, and how to recover when you're already toast.

https://preview.redd.it/3pjmcecoqf5g1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ddc79cb68c7f3e0da98bf3177582b52c60bc978

# Prevention

Stress management is about building patterns that keep your baseline manageable.

Morning

* Check your baseline stress before coffee or big decisions. If you're starting the day elevated, adjust expectations and build in more recovery time.

Throughout the day

* Compare today's stress load to your average. If you're running higher than usual, intervene early (walk, take a break, adjust your schedule).
* Time your breaks strategically. Catch stress while it's building, don't wait until you're exhausted.

Evening

* Review what drained you and what restored you today. Notice patterns. That 3pm crash isn't random — something's causing it.

20 minutes of ""stress processing time"" (same time each day)

* No phone, no work, no decisions.
* Walk, sit outside, stretch, do nothing. Your body will thank you.

# Weekly Review

Once a week, zoom out and look at patterns. Ask yourself:

* Is my baseline stress rising or falling over time? If it's climbing week over week, something needs to change.
* Which day is consistently worst? Why? Can I move, remove, or buffer the stressor?
* What triggers keep repeating? Morning inbox? Thursday meetings? Sunday evening dread? Once you see the pattern, you can intervene proactively.

If you're using Welltory, check your trends over days, weeks, and months to make pattern recognition easier. You'll see exactly when stress spikes, and it'll be easier to figure out what caused it.

# Emergency Protocol

If you've missed the window, and you're already fried, here's how to stop the bleeding:

1. 20-minute complete break. No phone, no work, no decisions. Just exist.
2. 20-minute walk outside. If the weather allows, go for it. It's your best recovery option.
3. Box breathing and cold exposure combo. 5 minutes breathing, then cold water on face/wrists.
4. Cancel or postpone non-essential tasks for the next few hours. You're not going to be productive anyway. Protect your recovery time.
5. Plan tomorrow based on today's data. Don't repeat the pattern. If today wrecked you, tomorrow needs to be lighter.

# Final Thoughts

Remember: the goal isn't zero stress. That's impossible and unhealthy.

The goal is to:

1. Catch stress early, before it accumulates
2. Counteract stress before it harms your arteries and wrecks your day
3. Build habits that keep your baseline stress manageable

You can do some of this by feel. But if you're serious about managing stress long-term, data helps you see patterns you'd otherwise miss. That's where tracking (whether with Welltory or another method) becomes valuable — not as a replacement for action, but as a tool to know when and how to act.

Today I got Butterscotch Swirl🍦in person and I also got Neapolitan Ice Cream 🍨 , Glazed Cherries 🍒 and Smoked Vanilla 🍺 online last night!

My favorites for the new drops was definitely most of the ‘Mix and Match Customize Sundae’ themed candles! I’m happy that I got most of them already bc they’re really good!

About the ‘Perfect Pairings’ and “Dill-Ight 🥒 ”:

It’s a no for me on the pickle one yall, that was not it at all haha

With the ‘Perfect Pairings’ though:

Chips and Salsa 🥑: This one smell exactly how I thought it would smell, it’s not bad nor good but I like that there is a savory scent in th lineup at least.

Coffee and Donuts 🍩: this one I think everyone will want (when I went in the second time, they were all GONE) it’s like a standard coffee candle but that glazed donut note in it is just 🤌🏼 it’s so goood

Popcorn and Slushie🍿 : I’m surprised how they aced the Popcorn note on this one? The slushie note is more like a general raspberry sweetness but I kinda like it. The popcorn smells more like stale rubbery popcorn that’s been left out but I’m sure it would get better when lit.

Pizza and Ranch 🍕: Girl…. This one is actually not as bad as wha some people were saying! It is disgusting but the scent is 10/10 in terms of what it’s advertising. I would never buy it though but it seemed to be one of the better selling ones in my store at least! 

I’m happy with what I got, 4 candles is extreme restraint from me but I actually have no space for anymore so overall successful, I don’t think I’ll go back for more at all haha

Good luck to everyone, I hope yall find the scents yall wanted!

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Iona Gaels vs. Quinnipiac Bobcats: A Three-Pointed Discomfort**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of mid-major titans as the Iona Gaels (5-0, 3-0 at home) host the Quinnipiac Bobcats (4-3, 2-2 on the road) in a MAAC showdown. Let’s break this down with the precision of a coach’s halftime speech and the humor of a player explaining why they forgot the playbook.

---

### Parse the Odds: The Math of Mayhem

The numbers scream “Iona party” louder than a student section after a buzzer-beater. The Gaels lead the MAAC in scoring (85.1 PPG) and shoot a scorching 47.4% from the field. Their secret weapon? Three-pointers. Iona averages **10.6 threes per game**, a rate **3.5 makes higher** than Quinnipiac allows (7.1). Meanwhile, Quinnipiac’s offense? A modest 8.8 threes per game, but Iona’s defense holds opponents to just 6.8. It’s like Quinnipiac brings a spoon to a buffet where Iona wields a ladle.

The odds back this up. Iona is the clear favorite at **-3.5 on the spread** with moneyline odds hovering around **1.55 (65% implied probability)**. Quinnipiac, meanwhile, needs a miracle and a 10-point rally in the final minute to cover, sitting at **+2.45 (41% implied)**. If you’re betting on Quinnipiac, you’re essentially saying CJ Anthony’s 26-point explosion against Delaware was a fluke—and that’s like saying coffee isn’t necessary on a Monday.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Trends, and Clutch Woes

No major injuries mar this matchup. Iona’s star, CJ Anthony (16.8 PPG, 45.7% shooting), is firing on all cylinders, while Toby Harris (12 PPG, 3 threes/game) is the team’s human highlight reel. Quinnipiac leans on Jaden Zimmerman (16.5 PPG) and Amarri Monroe (15.9 PPG), but their road struggles are glaring. The Bobcats are a mere 2-2 on the road, outscored by **3.5 points per game**—not exactly the resume of a team ready to storm a hostile home court.

A fun fact: Quinnipiac is **0-1 in one-possession games**

1pf429t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beauceron/comments/1pf429t/something_to_actually_help_anyone_bringing_a_new/,Something to ACTUALLY help anyone bringing a new pup home (or generally is interested in training),"This site is free. Not some stupid course youve gotta pay a college tuition for to get basic puppy manners. It gives you the tools you need, a breakdown, and SOOOOO many files and tricks/behaviors to choose from.

As a professional dog trainer, this is what i regularly refer clients to and i even use myself if i wanna practice a new trick.

https://knowledge.partnersdogs.com/training#main-content

Also!!! If youre bringing home a new puppy, work on desensitization ASAP. Even if unvaxxed. Bring pup out in a cart of baby carriage, bring them to home depot, lowes, pet stores, and just sit there and let them watch rewarding for good behavior. Touch them everyday everywhere. Paws, in between toes, wipe down genitals, arms, legs, back, sides, hold chin, check teeth, swab cheek, check eyes, ears, nose, lips, gums, skin, hold and grab and pinch them (gently). Get them used to veterinary and grooming touch early. Work on nail clipping early as well. You dont have to cut any length, just take the very very very tip off so theyre used to the movement (and you dont get scratched by puppy claws). Pretty much round it out. Especially get your puppy used to those double dews being trimmed.

If your puppy is having diarrhea!!! I recommend fortiflora or native pet pumpkin. If that doesnt help them go to the vet, or just generally go for a checkup if they start having diarrhea. This is just a supplement to potentially help.

Having issues with taping or posting? Ive used those nose opener thingies (breathe right strips?) On the inside of the ear connected to a shaved part of the cheek to hold down the ears. You can use thin cut vet tape for taco shape as well. For posting, popsicle stick with vet tape has worked for me. I also believe theres some posts you cna purchase that are like bandaids, hard in the middle but sticky on the outside to hold the shape. You can also use half cut cups or disposable coffee cups and vet wrap those. T wrapping is also pretty commoj if the ears are side flopping, you post from the center and hold the tips of the ears together. In a T shape.

If your pup is having sone reactivity!! Do more desensitization around dogs and people. Stop letting pup greet every dog or person on walks.

Play engagement games!!! Watch me game, name game, engage and disengage game, interact and recall game.

Reward heavily every single time!! Be fun to your dog, engaging, be the BEST thing in their lives. 

Bond. Bond. Bond. Do all the things.

Beaucies are a sensitive breed so set yourself up for success always. Dont tempt fate by putting your pup in an unsure position.

Im a firm believer of free education, that includes niche subjects like dog training and behavioral analysis. The world wide web is your friend, unless youre looking for certs or licenses, you rarely should need to pay 15k for dog training.

\-Excessive burping following meals - they are tiny, silent burps. 

\-My triggers seem to be coffee and meals that are heavy on dairy or fried.

1pf3y6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1pf3y6t/metaprompting_why_i_stopped_writing_direct_prompts/,Meta-prompting: Why I stopped writing direct prompts,"There's a prompting technique that doesn't get enough attention, even though it consistently produces better results.

**Standard prompting:** “Create a logo in pink and white tones with a cupcake icon.”  
**Meta-prompting:** “What's the optimal prompt structure for designing a logo with a cupcake icon?”  
Then you simply run the prompt it generates.

**Why it works:**  
The model understands its own inner logic better than we do. It also knows what level of context, constraints, and specificity will unlock its best performance — so letting it design the prompt often leads to cleaner, more optimized outputs.

**Here are a few practical cases where meta-prompting shines:**

* “I want to generate engaging post ideas for an Instagram account focused on personal development. How can I ask you this effectively?”
* “I’m setting up an artificial intelligence-themed YouTube channel. How should I ask you so I can get original, search-friendly, and engaging video ideas?
* “Can you create the best question that will create a compelling promotional copy for my new coffee brand?”
* “Can you write the most compelling prompt for a comprehensive blog post about technology trends from the past year?”

Why do ethnic cradles so strongly reject any reformation to appeal to the host culture?,"Anyone who has been Orthodox for 5 minutes knows that the Orthodox Church’s official name is the “One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church”; the “catholic” in its name means that the faith is universal - that whoever you are, wherever you are, the message of the Church is equally applicable to you as anyone else.

  
If that’s the case, then why can the message only be received if it’s in the aesthetics of the people listening in? If the ethnic divisions truly are purely jurisdictional and being “Bulgarian“/“Romanian”/“Russian”/Greek”/“Antiochan” Orthodox is vestigial, then why is it when a church changes those aesthetics and removes the appendix that it leads to schisms and disbelief?

  
Take the Mormons - Mormonism is American Exceptionalism as a religion - and yet, if you go to any Mormon meetinghouse overseas, you won’t find a single pair of cowboy boots, people don’t desire for gun rights, the “coffee hour” (Mormons don’t drink coffee) doesn’t purely consist of gumbo and cheeseburgers.

  
But if you go to an Orthodox parish, a majority of the converts will wear headcoverings, they suddenly have an opinion on Kosovo, and the coffee hour is borshch, dolmades, and falafels.

  
The actual Catholic Church had basically zero schisms when they moved away from Latin and promoted local art styles in parishes and cathedrals. I can move to the Philippines and go to Filipino services and not feel pressure to learn Tagalog.

She cared so much. When dad left that day before school, she always assured me he would come home. I had inherited her false sense of hope. It took her a while to begin dating again. The guys would come around and call me sport, or Benji, and think they would get close to her in the process. I always found it dreadful. They never lasted long, a date or two, until they couldn’t handle the heat. They were dating a single mother, who ensured her first priority was me. She was always there to calm me down. She never raised her voice at me. When I wet the bed she didn’t say anything or embarrass me. She just did the laundry.

She met Victor during a shift at her second job. He came in and ordered his coffee exactly how she ordered it. Which supposedly is enough to sweep my mother off of her feet. So much so, she had failed to remember to bring me to basketball practice that night. Mom was far too busy discovering what else they had in common.

Victor was a single father who had his kids too young. Victor didn’t even attempt to get to know me, or pretend to like me to get close to her. This was unprecedented. I met Victor when they were on their third date. This was a combined event with his two sons, Frank and Chase. Frank was my age and Chase was two years younger. The whole point of the night was to get his sons and I acquainted. Frank and Chase were both large in stature. I recall them looking down to me and their first words greeting me being, “this kid’s like a twig!”

They were bullies, just like their father. They didn’t even try to hide it. I guess I could applaud them not hiding their true selves, being the same jerks to me in front of my mom as they were behind her back. Why didn’t she stand up for me? What was so mesmerizing about Victor, that she had forgotten her true priority. They just treated me like I didn’t matter. I never picked where we got to eat, what activities we were doing. Before Victor, my mom never missed a basketball game or practice. If Frank or Chase had a football game, my mom would make time for both. She had chosen them over me for a while. I just believed it would eventually change. Whenever I voiced my opinions of Tweedledee and Tweedledum and their father, my mother would beg me to give them another chance. I always would.

It had been six months since fate decided to pick on me and guide Victor to that coffee shop. Tensions had flared this entire time between myself, Victor, and his sons. They didn’t care for me, and it was mutual. I tried. For her. My mom decided that a camping trip may help relieve some hard feelings. I knew it would never work. It was my first time ever going camping. We all drove in Victor’s big, gray truck. I don’t know how my mom could continue to date someone when they openly loved their truck more than her. Victor and the boys would take that vehicle camping all the time. They felt even more comfortable in the woods than they did in their home. I had been volunteered to sit in the middle of the back seat due to my size, and Frank and Chase took both window seats. Needless to say, I had no wiggle room for the four-hour journey down to Jackson, Ohio, where we would set up camp for the night. The drive was mundane and the interior reeked of cigarette smoke and grease. The fields of corn were all you could see. The sudden sight of hills broke the monotonous scenery and quickly became the highlight of the drive. How sad.

Between the three delinquents they must’ve killed an entire carton of cigarettes during the excursion. Did it not bother you, mom? The three chimneys who were escorting us into the middle of nowhere? Frank and Chase were too young to be smoking, but Victor didn’t care. He thought it sweet, them following in his footsteps. The cigarette burns in the upholstery would’ve been a nightmare for someone with trypophobia. Chase’s favorite game was to put his cigarettes out by my thighs and watch me scurry and dodge it, just to scoot too close to Frank in the process. Frank would shove me back towards the middle and I could still feel the mishandled warmth on my seat. Each time just reflected poorly on me. Victor would condemn me for interrupting the dull buzz of the radio. My mother never said a word.

When we arrived to the lake, Victor drove his truck off of the paved road like he owned the place. The sky was a dark gray canvas that covered the vibrant amber rays of the sun, shielding its innocent gold from our campsite. The trees surrounded an opening about a mile off of the path and he set his parking brake at this clearing. It was almost a perfect circle in the midst of these trees. There was a bright patch of yellow wildflowers by the exit of this campground. A path extended out of the circle that led directly to the shore of a lake. The water was murky, but the air was cool. I watched as Frank and Chase helped their father set up the tents. One tent housed my mother and Victor, another for his boys, and one for me. Others would take their own tent as some sort of honor. I knew better. Everyone there just wanted to be away from me.

I was occupying my time by skipping rocks across the lake. Everyone else was setting up camp, I hadn’t the slightest clue as to how any of that worked. Suddenly, I felt the temperature rise behind me. I turned around expecting to see a portable heater of some sort. It was fire. I watched the flames dance around the wood the Tavarez gang had placed in the pit. It quickly spread throughout. It was so… beautiful. They placed another log on top as I began inching closer. They had placed a ring of river rock around the fire, to contain it.

“Make yourself useful and keep feeding the fire.” Frank commanded me.

I didn’t mind his orders. In fact, I was happy to feed this fire. I wanted to watch it spread. I wanted to hear it flicker. I enjoyed watching it devour the wood I placed in there. I felt connected to it. I eventually grew curious and stuck the biggest log I could find into the pit they had forged. The fire took to the log and began climbing. It was proving to me how powerful it could be. It reached its peak. Only Victor’s push was strong enough to break my hypnosis. I was pushed away and had tripped over the bundle Frank and Chase had collected.

“What the hell are you doing? This fire’s way too big to be managed by someone like you,” Victor questioned me. I watched him from the ground. My fall had scattered the fire’s food. My hands broke my fall but my skin collected pebbles and absorbed them. The fire was completely under my control. In fact, it was the only bit of control I’d felt in a long time. The fire was an impressive size, but his display of aggression was just an excuse to make me feel small. He began stomping on the fire, as if me ever having control over it managed to render it useless. Why take his hatred for me out on the fire? Why was he ending what the fire had worked so hard for?

“I… Frank and Chase told me to feed the fire.” I responded.

“Is that true?” He turned towards his boys who had arrived back to the scene. “You know this loser’s never been camping.” My mom stood there watching, silent.

“Ben asked if he could put logs in the fire. I didn’t want to tell him no.”

They lied! They had put me in a position of humiliation. I couldn’t even tend to the fire correctly. Victor could. Frank and Chase certainly could. I spent time contemplating how my mother could watch me get yelled at, and not say anything. What did they have to offer? Did I need to learn how to start a fire for her to stand up for me?

I began walking back towards the lake. The water was not as comforting as its elemental opposite. I find water overwhelming. I heard the distinct flicker of Victor’s lighter as he lit his seven hundredth on the day. I heard him unthread the lid of the lighter fluid bottle. He poured it in the circle he had just stomped out. When he was satisfied with the arrangement of the river rock, and the half-charred logs in the circle, he took one last drag. The smoke ascended as he released his grip. His yellowing fingertips just mere feet away from an ensuing flame. I wondered what emotions I would feel if he was engulfed himself. If he had accidentally got lighter fluid on his boots, or the cuff of his work jeans, that smelled even worse than he did. I wondered what would happen if ash obeyed me.

They all set up chairs around the Victor’s fire. Victor ordered Chase to get the marshmallows from his truck. They didn’t even invite me to roast them. Instead, I sat by the shore. The clouds parted, revealing a somber moon. I looked up and empathized with it. Its face offered me company. It was there for all. It wouldn’t choose somebody else over me. Its borrowed light shined on all. I wondered if the sun felt betrayed by the moon. If the sun felt as if the moon wasn’t borrowing its light, it was stealing it. I wondered if the sun would be brighter without the moon’s reflective theft. I wondered if I had been better off without the parasitic moon mooching off of the innocence of the day’s magnificent Yellow. Then I was reminded that the sun hid from me all day, and wasn’t going to show its face all weekend. Hell, it hadn’t shown its face in a long time.

“Good night, Benjamin!” My mother called to me. I ignored her. I heard a splash of water and then the murderous sizzle of extinguished fire. I must’ve stayed by the shore for thirty minutes, watching the ripples from my rocks affect its silver reflection. I could not fathom what led my mom to believe this camping trip would be fruitful. She was asking me to make amends with liars, with bullies, with boys who never get disciplined. I don’t know what made them so special to her. They all but abused me. I always had the short end of the stick. I got the worst seats, my games were less important, I was never seen or heard anymore. It was because of him bringing them into our lives. There was nothing I could do.

I was approaching my tent when I noticed something. A surviving ember. I moved closer to it. I watched it glow. It was trying to breathe. I planted some paper towels next to it for fuel. Once it had exhausted these sources, I grabbed a piece of firewood from the bundle and attempted to revive it. I nursed it back to health. The snores from the tents, the occasional bird, and the flicker of the flames were all that interrupted silence. At this moment, the flames ignited something within me. This simple element seemed to provide a channel for my hatred. All of my feelings of anguish, of despair, of utter disgust with my mom’s choice in love, was boiling my blood. That’s when my desires got the best of me.

I counted each of their snores individually, ensuring all four were asleep. I slowly walked towards my tent and quietly unzipped it. I would need an alibi. I walked back and began kicking the rocks around the pit, making their spherical formation an unorganized mess. I found a skewer they had used earlier and scattered the bundle of logs. I wanted this to look like an accident. The fire continued to burn in all the areas it covered. I noticed a piece of firewood had not fully been engulfed yet. I reached down and grabbed the portion that had not yet been scorched. I felt the heat against my hands, the power of the world seemed to be within my grasp. I ascended upon the tent that housed the twins of terror. The traumatic memories of dodging Chase’s burn attempts provided me with an assurance. Seeing their tent in flames would heal me. They had left a corner of their entrance exposed. I stuck the torch in its opening and dropped the log.

Nothing else in the world mattered. The fire had helped me extinguish the pain their torment had put me through. What would quickly invite their panic, had bred my salvation. The fire gently grazed the tent. The nylon quickly accepting its touch. The quick caress of my creation began to shrink the material. I watched the nylon shed and drip. The liquefied nylon had only just began to quench my thirst when Frank’s snore was interrupted.

I tiptoed to my tent. Once I had reached the inside of my destination I glanced back only to admire the unorganized ruins of the fire. It looked as if somehow the pit had been tampered with, and guided directly to their tent. I quietly zipped up my tent and waited for Frank to realize.

The screams came. Following the subsequent unzipping sounds from the two tents. I figured it would be suspicious if I stayed. I donned my best tired expression and followed their lead.

“What the hell happened out here?” Victor was screaming. Frank and Chase frantically began stomping the fire out in their tent, while Victor was dousing the remaining fire outside of the tent in water. “Did nobody put this out?” Victor was frightened. That made this even better.

“I did!” My mom promised.

“Apparently not good enough,” Victor responded. Everyone was panicking. I even helped Victor stomp it out.

“How would it have gotten out of the pit?” Chase asked.

“Fire spreads, dummy.” Frank wrongly answered.

“Not like this,” Chase’s curiosity startled me. “I think loner boy over there messed with our pit!”

All eyes turned to me. How had he known! All it would have taken was a couple loose sticks and some carelessly misplaced firewood to lead a fire to the wrong place. Why did he accuse me?

“Hey, he was asleep in there, you saw him come out just like I did. He wouldn’t do something like this.” Was I being deceived? Had my mom really defended me?

“I mean, how did the pit get messed up. He was the last one to his tent.” Frank chimed in.

“It was you. I saw you playing with that fire earlier. You trying to kill my sons, boy?” Victor began to charge towards me. That’s when I saw my mom’s final act of courage, as she lunged in front of him. Victor swiftly retaliated and hit my mother with a backhand. His entire demeanor shifted. “Baby, I’m sorry… I,” The first bit of remorse I had ever seen from that monster. His face shifted. He went from personified anger, to a child. A child who feared repercussions.

My mom held her face, speechless. I had just witnessed my mother get slapped by her boyfriend. Mist developed in her eyes. Continued apologies from Victor consumed the air. The clouds covered the moon. Ironically, only my creation illuminated our faces. I was overcome with an intense feeling of guilty relief. Surely my mother would leave this lunatic and his two copycat sons. Our world would once again be at peace.

My plan to burn their belongings and possibly them alive hadn’t exactly turned out the way I had hoped. Regardless, I considered it a success because my mom decided to sleep in my tent that night. It was far too late to pack up and leave.

“I’m sorry, Benjamin.” My mom apologized for their accusations. The only thing I regretted about the entire ordeal, was that Victor hadn’t been in their tent.

We packed up the next morning and began the drive home. I looked back towards the lake and noticed the yellow patch of flowers seemed to have grown tremendously. The clouds weren’t hiding the sun today, it had shown its face to me. I was proud of the sun. I believed it would take back and hoard its own light.

The car ride’s silence was loud. Frank and Chase’s condemning glances were enough for me to know they truly believed it was me who tampered with the fire. Mom was persistent the fire was a freak accident. For a while, it caused a rift between her and Victor. It was just good to know she truly was on my side.

It couldn’t have been more than a month later. It had just been a normal night. Mom and I had gotten into a big argument over Victor. I had been wrong. Day shifted into night, just like it always would, yet the moon still had light. Mother and I could’ve been long gone by now. I was sure she could do better, I was sure a life without him would be better. She didn’t quite see it that way. I had found out him and the boys were coming over to our apartment but I refused to be around them. I grabbed a backpack with some school work in it and walked out. The plan was to grab a bite to eat until their visit was over.

I was just at the corner store when I noticed five missed calls from mom. The echo from the sirens driving past the store, affirmed my decision to not even complete my purchases. They were heading for our complex. I ran out of the store and didn’t slow down on the way home. I realized I was running alongside a fire truck. My worry grew. I hoped with everything in me, that she was okay.

I finally arrived back to the complex where I saw a truck ablaze. Victor, Frank, Chase, and my mother were standing there, accompanied by police. The fire truck had gotten there before me and began to make efforts to extinguish his vehicle. My mother’s tears allowed me to guess what would transpire. That’s when the gazes switched from the truck, to me.

I was rushed by the police and handcuffed. I was subsequently stuffed in the back of one of their vehicles. A battle of words ensued as my rights were read, and I insisted I had nothing to do with the fire that had completely destroyed Victor’s truck. I sat in the backseat, restrained, falsely charged. Victor and his boys were talking to the police and pointing towards me. He placed his arms around my mother and she cried in his shoulder. Rains from the fire hose put an end to the incriminating flames. A fireman walked near the truck and picked up a cigarette butt by the front of the car. He spoke and held it in the air. Everyone looked. I could only assume that he named that cigarette as the fire’s origin. There was only one problem. I was under suspicion of lighting my mom’s boyfriend’s truck on fire, when the fire had started from a cigarette. I didn’t smoke, but I knew someone who did.

After a lengthy process, I was spared from jail. I was cleared of any criminal charges, but the judge recommended a school in Barberton. Instead, I was invited to a behavior school, full of boys who had gotten in trouble, who needed to change. The judge left it up to my mother.

“It has become apparent to me, my son needs to go somewhere, where he will be able to find God.” My mother’s words seemed influenced, rehearsed. Perhaps the newly placed ring on her finger came with a command to send me away. Victor and his sons had succeeded in getting me out of the picture. It took a second fire that had my name on it to enlist my mom on Victor’s side. She failed to come to my defense the second time, despite me never holding a cigarette in my life. What did it say about his hatred for me, that he would light his own gray truck on fire to get rid of me? The semester at the school started that very next day. Not once did my mother look me in the eye.

In the movies and stories and books, the good guys always win. I was the good guy, and even though going to this school was a setback, I thought my mom would come to her senses, ditch the man and the rock, and come save me. I always thought she would.

“Ben?” Headmaster Hostler brought me back to reality. The phone was placed on the receiver. The call with him was over.

“Yes?” I responded.

“Your stepfather…”

“Do not call him that.” Hostler gulped.

“…And I agree that a research paper on a topic of your choice is the best response for what has occurred here today. Sending you home would not solve anything.” Of course Victor didn’t want me home.

“You can conduct your research in the computer lab in the library, and I expect this paper by New Year’s Day. I know you’ve been through hard things. Today has been hard, my staff betrayed you. But you must be punished for the crime. I can think of no better punishment than schoolwork during a break. Consider this mercy.”

Mercy? If it wasn’t for Victor, I would not be here in the first place. I got up without saying a word and walked out of his office. Due to Mrs. Tavarez’ final words to me as Ms. Doyle, I had already decided on a topic.

Deciding on a religion to cover had been tricky. I was driven away from Christianity. It was hard for me to research a God who would allow Victor to wrong me the way he did. Islam and Judaism were dismissed for similar reasons. The most intriguing ideas I had found stemmed from reincarnation. What an incredible idea! An eternal soul trapped in an imperfect body. A specific part of this idea intrigued me especially. This portion hadn’t been covered by any of the databases I searched. If our souls are eternal, that would mean our souls had occupied a body here on earth prior to us. I couldn’t be the only person on this planet who was greatly curious with who I had been in my past life. I decided this would be the topic of my paper, and I would uncover who I was before this life. The problem was, your soul could have been anywhere on this green earth. I truly was looking for a needle in a haystack.

Logic told me that the body my soul lived in couldn’t have been alive while I was. So I dismissed anybody alive before 8:34 p.m. May 14th, 2000. Maybe that was it! My studies described the desire of a soul was such that it was in search of perfection. The soul had to exist within a body that did no wrong, to achieve its peaceful end goal. Why would a soul waste any time trying to find another body to inhabit?

I began my searches for my past life with this exact hypothesis. This certainly narrowed down my wide array of data. I searched people who died on May 14th, 2000, in the search engine. Obituaries popped up that I would read, and cross off. I came across a few names that I wrote down, to come and study their lives further. I was on the second page of the search results when I came across Arnold Lamb Jr. who’s death had been posted by the website for the state of Arkansas. I clicked the link.

A man’s mugshot had occupied the right half of the computer monitor. The left described this man’s life and legacy. Lamb was a convicted serial killer who had spent his life terrorizing the state of Arkansas. He was sentenced to death by the electric chair, in that very state. His sentence was carried out on 8:33 p.m. May 14th, 2000.

My jaw hit the floor. I was fascinated, to say the least. A man who had been put to death the exact minute before my introduction to this world. I studied more of this man’s life. He was born in Florida in 1948. His mother was a sex worker who worked in Miami and he was a direct result of her career. His mother decided to move back in with her parents following the news of her pregnancy. They moved out of her parents’ house when he was eight years old. His grandparents had accused him of killing the family dog. Apparently, his mother defended him. When the accusations did not cease, they decided to move. Every source I could find stated that he had a very strange relationship with his mother. He would run away from their apartment, and return almost on a weekly basis. When he was eighteen years old, he was kicked out by his mother and his stepfather, whom she had met when Arnold was sixteen. I took special interest in this, when I uncovered that one of the reasons he was removed from their house was due to his habit of wetting the bed, and his stepfather was repulsed by the accidents.

Following his eviction, Arnold moved to Arkansas to be with some cousins. This is when his first known kill took place. He would eventually kill five women. All of whom resembled his mother in looks and in lifestyle. It began to scare me when I uncovered how they caught Arnold. The matches that had been used to burn one particular victim’s body had been linked directly to a purchase Arnold had made. He was obsessed with fire, and used this as a disposal method. When a witness placed him at the fifth burial site, he confessed to this murder and the previous four.

Had I found my soul’s previous occupant? It couldn’t have been this easy. Then again, his problems seemed eerily similar to mine. That would certainly explain my obsession with fire. Without my mom, it was the only place I found comfort. I had claimed it was an accident, but I killed my mom’s cat. Just to see what it would feel like. I had wet the bed consistently since my dad left.

For Arnold, it seemed as if his trigger was when his mom exited his life. I understood exactly what he was experiencing. My mother didn’t defend me when I had wrongfully been convicted of arson. I didn’t need this place she had doomed me to. She abandoned me. For the first time in so long, I felt I had an explanation for why I was the way that I was. It wasn’t fate that brought Victor into my life. My soul was just tainted. My soul attracted trauma. My soul was incapable of having a loving mother. My soul was destined for hell, and found comfort in its burning previews. I finally had an explanation.

Feeling I had gotten more than I bargained for in this research paper, I rolled my chair away from the computer and rested my head into the palms of my hands. I had uncovered a frightening truth about myself. Unbeknownst to Mrs. Tavarez, her words had pioneered a search that would directly lead me to answers. The beauty of reincarnation is that your soul does not rest until it is able to achieve a life without mistakes. I had a choice to make. Would I succumb to my childhood traumas and behaviors that afflicted my current body and my last? Was I even capable of killing somebody? Had my mom leaving me really drained all hope for my soul from this life? Could I change the trajectory of my life?

I closed my eyes and saw the flames from the campfire, from the truck, from the stove earlier that day. I saw the look in my mother’s eyes as she was slapped by Victor. I felt the cold stares from Frank and Chase. I heard the silence from that car ride. Perhaps they plotted to frame me in their tent that night, so they wouldn’t have to deal with me anymore. I heard my mother imploring me to find religion, and change. I felt the agony of waiting for my mother’s rescue. Any ounce of hope I had, had been drained on this one single dark day. Feeling lost, I opened my eyes, rolled back to the computer and wiggled the mouse to awaken the monitor. Towards the bottom of the article, I read what Arnold Lamb Jr’s final words had been.

“I at least hoped my mother would be here to say goodbye.”

In that moment, on that day in the computer lab, located within the Barberton’s Boys Behavior Boarding School, I decided without a doubt, that I would leave it up to my next life to resist the urges of my soul.

1pf3pgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Prostatitis/comments/1pf3pgk/jpouch_total_colectomy_cancer_treatment_prostatis/,J-Pouch Total Colectomy Cancer Treatment Prostatis,"Hi I am 37 years old and have for the last decade had a regiment of chemotherapy and radiation for colorectal cancer brought on by lynch syndrome (it causes early bonus cancer) which was followed by a total colectomy with J-Pouch. All the trauma/scarring to the pelvic region has always felt drastically different from what used to be the norm for me.

Ever since all of that was completed and I went on about my life the pelvic region and all of it’s neighbors experienced the joys of casual radiation burn among other day to symptoms. Sometime the bottom half of my balls just feel sore and that feeling can extend up the perineal. The area where I assume my prostate is at times feels inflamed and is mostly a passive radiating burn sensation with some pressure.

  
It used to be only a couple times a year I would experience heavy burning sensation in the urethra which brought with it intense urge to pee but there wasn’t much urine behind it and relief didn’t come for a few minute. After a few years I started to develop a pinching feeling during sex even with masturbation.

Most of the doctors told me to take Tamulosin (flomax) to help relax the prostate. It appeared to help during the first couple years of taking it consistently but then I started to experience flare ups in the prostate area which was noticeably present with pressure and the persistent burning feeling. Never had issues maintaining a stream of urine let alone starting but most noticeably was the effect flare ups had on my sex life.

Pain or discomfort never went above 3-4 but it did have the effect of lowering sex drive, difficulty maintaining erection and pinching during ejaculation. As a J-Pouch patient I don’t urinate too often as the way my bowels operate post surgery unless I am drinking a fair amount of liquids.

Up until August flare ups wouldn’t last terribly long but I had a period of about 2 weeks where it didn’t go away and my urologist prescribed Cefdinir influenced by my allergy to Levofloxacin and Metronidazole (I may have the names wrong but both are antibiotics I was given in the hospital post total colectomy). It appeared to work after the two weeks and my follow up appointment shortly thereafter was positive as everything had returned to “normal“. 

After about 2 weeks it started to come back an although there was no more pinching it was a constant burning feeling that was radiating rather than a stinging feeling of varying intensity. I messaged my urologist and they told me to try again with Cefdinir which I did and brought with it a brief reprieve but upon completion it had simply come back nearly full force.

I managed to get an appointment scheduled before X-Mas but the day after I decided to schedule things started to magically feel “better” and here I am on day 4 of things being maybe a 1-2 with it getting more noticeably in the evening with mostly just a sore feeling rather than burning.

It’s worth mentioning I live a somewhat sedentary lifestyle, weigh 240 pounds and have an okay diet at best. I drink 3 cups of coffee on average in the morning and 1 healthade kumbacha with 1-2 Humms Black can kumbachas. I don’t have soda in the house and don’t eat much raw vegetables. Meat, Cheese and bread/noodles are my best friend for regular food. I try for dinner to have boiled green beans or broccoli & cauliflower sometimes carrots or squash. I mostly drink seltzer in place of water because I am a stubborn and spoiled whore of a human.

I am not sure what to expect out of my urologist because a finger in the ass and one prescription later he doesn’t seem terribly interested in figuring me out because I never even heard of CPPS from him but rather this subreddit from a google search.

Anyone have anything of a similar or related to my experience as describe? I skimmed the titles and read some other posts in this subreddit but nothing quite like my adventure.

# Weather & Weekend Outlook:

Friday morning started brutally cold with temps well below zero, climbing only into the teens this afternoon with wind chills in the single digits. Saturday brings relief with highs in the low 30s under cloudier skies. Sunday starts sunny before clouds move in with a chance of light snow showers by afternoon, dropping a coating to an inch for most areas. Monday morning? Back to that bracing zero-degree wake-up call. The higher terrain could see a few more inches over the weekend.

# SOME of this Week's News:

* Democratic leaders are pushing ahead with forced school district consolidation despite their own task force recommending voluntary mergers instead, with property taxes projected to rise 11.9% next year

As always, another coffee meetup this Saturday at 10am at Zero Gravity, I hope its another good turn out. It’s always great seeing familiar faces, and even better meeting new ones each week. We’ll chat about Vermont living, touch on a bit of local news, and share what’s worth checking out around town this weekend. Come hang, have a coffee, and join the conversation.

He loves this mug and insists on repairing the handle with super glue every time it breaks and continues to use it. I would love to replace it for him so he will agree to toss it, as I think it’s a death trap. 

It doesn’t need to be the exact design - looking for a similarly sized Notre Dame mug/bowl. (There are so many regular coffee mug-sized options that he is not interested in. He mostly uses the mug to scramble eggs, for some reason.)

Ready for a big, warm, simple shift in social media? By 2026, the most successful brands won't feel like brands at all. They'll feel like a friendly conversation. It's time to move from making announcements to making **genuine connections.** Imagine your social feed as a cozy coffee shop corner, not a billboard. It's about listening, nodding, sharing a laugh, and offering real, personal help.

Here's the trick: stop planning posts, and start planning **invitations.** Use your stories to ask for opinions, not just broadcast news. Reply to comments with thoughtful questions, not just ""thanks!"" Host a casual ""ask me anything"" audio chat. The tools are getting smarter, too soon, AI can help you have these personal chats at scale, making sure no follower's question gets lost in the inbox. The goal is to make every single person who interacts with you feel like they've been heard. In 2026, the size of your community will matter less than the strength of its connections.

My boyfriend and I both give each other small gifts sometimes,  he buys me keychains etc. I also do the same. I’ve gotten him earphones, hoddie, tissues boxes when he needed, recently a phone case for his new phone, and I’ve paid for food date and other things here and there equally as him.

The issue is that recently he broke his glass milk tumbler while washing. I told him he could use the office sipper he got since he already has it, and instead of just acknowledging it, he said that I didn’t even offer to buy him a new one out of love.
So I said fine, I’ll buy one I genuinely didn’t mind.

Then he said something like, Only a coffee mug for a birthday gift? And I told him the mug is separate, I’ll get a birthday gift too. I even asked him what he wants this birthday, I offered to gift him digital gold or anything he’d like, just let me know.

For context, last year I gifted him a trimmer because he wanted one. He buys his own clothes so I didn’t interfere there. I haven’t bought this year’s gift yet, but I had plans.

But the part that is hurting me is , he keeps saying things like I don’t care about him anymore,  completely forgetting the things I have done or given him. And this happened twice this week. It’s like the small things don’t count unless it's a “big, proper gift.”

It's not like I don't want to give him gifts. I genuinely do. But lately, he has been taking offense at small things, as if I’m not doing anything for him. Just yesterday we had a big fight because of the same issue, he told me he broke his glass tumbler and instead of asking whether he got hurt, I accidentally asked where he got a single  bowl that broke. He got upset, hung up on me, and it escalated into a huge argument and he said that i don't care about him and all. I do care about him, i always make sure he is healthy and happy and he reciprocates the same efforts but yeah idk why is he behaving like this out of the blue.

Would love to hear other viewpoints or advice, because I’m starting to feel confused and a little hurt.

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I exchange small gifts, but recently he’s been saying I don’t care about him because I didn’t offer to buy a new tumbler when his broke and because I didn’t ask if he was hurt. He said a coffee mug isn’t enough as a birthday gift, even though I give things when I can and asked him what gift he wants. He seems to overlook the things I do, gets upset easily, and it’s starting to hurt me. Looking for outside perspective.",4,1764960919.0,AmItheKameena,3,1.0,False

I turned 21 a bit ago and live in NRW, Germany, very close to the Netherlands and Belgium. I'm 198cm tall, athletic, and I'd say I'm kinda cute? (I'll send selfies early on so you can be the judge of that yourself!). I finished my bachelors of law last thursday and I currently work in public administration in an upper-level role in IT.

**In my free time, I'm into**

* **Reading** (Mostly classics and fantasy novels)
* **Artsy stuff** (Writing, making clay figures, taking photos)
* **Cooking** (I love showing care through food!)
* **Gaming** (would love to play some co-op together c: - big fan of co-op horror if that's your vibe!)
* **Binge-watching shows** (maybe watch the final season of Stranger Things together now that it´s out?)
* **Fitness** (mostly lifting, jogging and calisthenics)
* **Traveling**
* **Self-care** (I have a real love for fragrances and taking care of myself)

I'm the calm, confident, and dependable type. I'm direct in communication and I keep my plans. In public I'm pretty calm, but in private I'm very affectionate and playful. I really love taking care of the people I love through food, touch, words, and preparing surprises.

**What I hope we'll build**

I hope we can build something with a genuine friendship and genuine care as the foundation, without rushing anything. I'm looking for monogamy, adult communication, equal effort, and consistency. When we like each other, we act like it.

As for what I bring to the table for that:

* Stability & Dependability
* Availability (I protect time for my person)
* Maturity (and good, direct communication)
* A bit of silly, dry, gentle humor and teasing

I value those traits in others a lot as well. So what I'm ultimately looking for is deep, mature, mutual devotion. A relationship where we both give to each other because it makes us happy. Not because we need each other to function, but because being together is fulfilling.

**Little dreams about us**

I'd love to travel a lot with you and make many memories! I'm already planning to go to Lapland and Japan or Taipei next year - ideally with the right person. A few dream spots:

* One of those glass igloo hotels in Lapland (🙏PLEASE look them up, you won't regret it)
* Touring through Europe together in a van (maybe one that we build together?) and the same through rural Japan

That said, I'm also a bit of a homebody. Day-to-day, I picture steady and cozy weeknights, with new experiences on weekends and holidays. And if we do end up working out, my favorite thing to do together, especially in winter, would always be cuddling up and watching shows in bed together.

**Thanks for reading <3**

I'm not too experienced with relationships, but I've put a lot of thought into what I want and what I can give. Life's been going really well lately, I feel steady, content and I feel like I have a lot to give. Because of that, I've had the growing feeling that someone is missing (You!😗). Like the titel implies, I´d prefer to meet someone from NL/BE/DE so meeting up and spending time will be a lot easier, but anywhere in EU is alright too.

**So, get in those DMs already!**

A quick hello with your age and the country you're from is a perfect start. To get us talking, tell me what kind of date we'll be doing first: coffee, a museum, or one of your suggestions!

Seriously, if you’re interested even a little, just say hi. You don’t need the perfect opener :)

Into art, content creation & fitness

Easy-going, respectful, and actually enjoy good conversations

1pf35ee,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pf35ee,Candle Day review part - all the weird scents! (And more),"Went to two Bath and Body Works today. Here is review part 1. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/bathandbodyworks/s/W4rV5bM1w0

Went to another BBW and got to smell the weird scents! Here is review part 2. 

* Pizza and Ranch - went to two BBW stores, and here the BBW employee just straight up said this one was gross haha. They weren’t lying! The worst candle I’ve ever smelled. Smells like belly button cheese. Sweat cheese. Wow this is literally awful. Not even cute awful. But gross. Do not buy. 
* Chips and Salsa - smells like jalapeño. Like how the top note of Holiday Dill Pickles smells like jalapeño. 
* Coffee and Donuts - this is like Glazed Pumpkin body mist but smoother, less musky. 
* Popcorn and Slushy - smells like popcorn flavor Jelly Belly jelly beans. Plus the blue raspberry burst fragrance mist from over the summer, like a blue raspberry jolly rancher. The combination is unique like munching on different flavors of jelly beans together. I think it’s not bad. 
* Holiday Dill-ight dill pickle candles - there’s two, not sure what the difference is in difference color packaging. It reminds me salt and vinegar chips, plus some dill pickle seasoning. I like eating dill pickle flavor chips and this candle smells like that to me. If you didn’t mind the holiday dill ornament fragrance, I guess you wouldn’t mind this. It does smell like chips I would want to eat. Not sure about it as a candle though. 

Fall type scents: 
* fresh cinnamon rolls - it’s like the cinnamon spice delight fragrance mist. I like this one as it smells less synthetic than others. 
* cinnamon sugared pecans - it’s like the fresh cinnamon rolls candle but with like a red cinnamon kick, like fireball cinnamon. I like it. Very fall fragrance though. 
* Paris Cafe - super strong coffee bean (espresso). Maybe one of the strongest smelling candles in the store on cold. Quite nice. Like Rich Espresso body mist, but less sweet, less hazelnut note. More of a black coffee which I prefer. 

Winter type scents: 
* Falling Flurries - like this one! It smells like the sweater Weather candle maybe, but like a green version because of the thyme note. I think it’s a nice twist on that type of fragrance. 
* marshmallow fireside - it’s nice. Just a simple marshmallow fragrance. 
* vanilla buttermint - marshmallow like marshmallow fireside, but mintier. A mild scent. Nice. Not the most intense though. 
* Peppermint Marshmallow - has an unlisted chocolate note. Is like a more peppermint version of Milk Bar Peppermint Bark Truffle. Ok if you like that scent, but to this one doesn’t really stand out. Other peppermint scents are more peppermint or more marshmallow and better. 
* Cozy Winter Cottage - one of the few candles with distinct woody cedar notes. I liked it. Has more actual woods note than Christmas Cabin, which is nice but like a smoky vanilla, kind of in the general direction of Vanilla Romance but not nearly as sweet (my store also had a few vanilla romance candles). 
* Milk Bar Raspberry Holiday Pie Bar - this smells great. A unique candle in the store. Raspberry thumbprint cookie. Basically like the body care. Recommend. 
* Frosted Cranberry - it’s like a cranberry version of Black Cherry Merlot. 

Spring/Summer scents: 
* island margarita - basically a mango scent. It’s pretty. Pretty typical for summer but I liked it. 
* Limoncello Lemon - smells pretty much like a lemon ice slush. Sweeter than i expected. Sugar lemon, not zesty lemon. 
* Pink Apple Punch - misnamed. Basically a honeydew melon scent.
* Sunny Coconut - coconut and pineapple. The pineapple comes through a lot, like a very sweet, sugary dole pineapple juice from the can. If you want a pineapple fragrance check this out. 
* Cactus Blossom - smells different? A bit of a cologne bergamot note? I don’t know if I was smelling it right idk. 
* Fresh Cut Lilacs - smells pretty strong like the spring summer release. 
* eucalyptus rain - kind of faint but it was nice. Kind of reminded me of Sweater Weather body care, the different one that smells unisex, but without the cologne bergamot. Just the leaves note, but mintier. (I could be wrong honestly I was smelling a lot and there were many eucalyptus scents)

Body care candles:
* Into the Night - very sweet, plummy. Smells more like Maleficent than Into the Night. I think it’s too much. 

Cologne type scents: 
* bergamot waters - very bergamot cologne. I think a dude would like this one. Like the cologne element of sweater Weather body care (not the candle) x100. 
* Other options with similar bergamot note as bergamot waters is Bergamot & Musk and Black Tie. Bergamot Waters is the most intense, straightforward bergamot cologne. bergamot and musk is slightly toned down, more blended out, diffused. Black Tie is also a blend, different. 
* Black Teakwood - pretty much like mahogany teakwood. It does have intensity. 

My likes: 
* Personally I’m into Fireside Flurries because it has a green note i like. Realistically this is what I would get. I’m a sweater Weather candle fan and like something a bit similar but different 
* Raspberry Holiday Pie Bar—yum!
* Paris Cafe - smells legit. 
* Cozy Winter Cottage or Christmas Cabin - into these 
* Island margarita - it’s too early for summer scent but this is nice. Pink Apple Punch is also nice if you like honeydew melon. 
* Eucalyptus Rain - nice. There are many eucalyptus scents at BBW now, hard to keep them straight. This one had the most elements though. 
* Fresh cut lilacs - very spring. Pretty. 
* The cologne type scents - don’t mind them. 
* Popcorn & slushy - weird, but kinda works. It reminds me of the smell of a movie theater snack stand. Popcorn, slushy.

1pf34hw,https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/1pf34hw/newbie_question_about_pelliclemother/,newbie question about pellicle/mother,"Hey all. For a fun project, I decided to make 2 types of vinegar: pineapple and apple cider. This is my first time making vinegar, but I've been homebrewing for years (booch, mead, beer, cider, etc).

For the pineapple vinegar, I started by making a batch of tepache. When fermentation fully stopped, i strained into a mason jar, added a tablespoon of raw ACV, and screwed the ring onto the jar with a coffee filter instead of a lid. After a few more weeks, there is now a good looking pellicle sitting on top.

For the apple cider vinegar, i took a bottle of \~7% abv homebrew hard cider, degassed it in a blender, and added in a few tablespoons of the same raw apple cider vinegar. I've jarred it in the same way (mason jar with a coffee filter and the ring on tight. After a few weeks, there is no pellicle.

Both taste, well, like vinegar. Everything tastes like I'm on the right track. I'm curious about the pellicle though.

For the hard cider, i pasteurized, filtered,  and eventually force carbonated in a keg before bottling (not a fan of bottle bombs). I assume the complete lack of viable yeast is why a pellicle did not form. Does that check out?

I'd like to start two more experiments, one with a mead, one with a stout. How would you recommend introducing acetobacter? Would adding a bit of pellicle from the pineapple vinegar be effectively the same as adding in some of the cider vinegar? Is there an ideal?

For long term storage, should I just pour both my current vinegars through coffee filters and store in swing top bottles? ",1,1764960293.0,fermentation,2,1.0,False

1pf33m4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1pf33m4/never_haunt_a_human/,Never Haunt a Human,"Kriklepap, the First Scion of his Age, opened the spectral paper. The Galactic Ghosts’ Union had finalized a new contract for haunting and possession jobs, and Kriklepap was keenly interested in how it would impact their postmortem career. The paper had published the new contract in full. Kriklepap skimmed the pages until they found the section that would impact them directly. There were always new rules when a new species reached the stars, and humans, only marginally touching other species, were already causing a lot of issues. To their delight, all the Gaia-related sections were grouped together. The first change was beyond even Kriklepap’s experience or imagination.

All Gaia-originating Spiritual or Fae entities are classified as Eldritch by default.

“Wait, what?” Kriklepap said aloud.

“Hmmmmmm?” the sleeping human in the lounge said.

“Sorry,” Kriklepap whispered. “Go back to sleep.”

“Nope. Awake now,” the human replied, sitting up and stretching. “Coffee. Time for coffee.”

Kriklepap reflected on the fact that this human was about to ingest close to 30 times the toxin dose used to execute Kriklepap themselves a few thousand years ago. The same molecule had evolved on Gaia and humans casually used enough to kill an entire family as a casual stimulant. Kriklepap mulled this thought over in their mind, thinking so hard small clouds started to form, visible between their ghostly ears.

“What ya thinkin’ about?” the Human said, putting ground, roasted beans into a pressurized-steam herbal extractor.

“Now I’m thinking about how visible brain clouds only show up near a human,” Kriklepap replied.

“What were you thinking about before that?” the Human asked.

“The Galactic Ghosts’ Union signed a new contract. ALL your supernatural beings are being classified as ‘Eldritch’ by default.”

“Huh,” the human said, watching the dark, frothy, stream of toxins flow into their espresso mug. “Is that significant?”

“Significant?” Kriklepap said, their voice rising a little. “It took Cthulhu 200 Galactic Standard Years to earn that rating!”

The human said, “Well, we did knock him out with a steam boat one of the times he tried to rise on Gaia.”

“Please don’t say that,” Kriklepap said. “I know it’s true, but dwelling on that information can cause severe psychic trauma to some of our neighbors.”

“Good point,” the human replied, taking a sip of the hot liquid. “And Skittlerip down the hall is too damn cute to even think about hurting. Anything else interesting in the new contract?”

“I’m still reading it, but there’s something about a committee for authorizing any new hauntings with humans involved.”

The human took another sip. “So, like, this situation? There’d-a-been a committee or something to approve it?”

Kriklepap sighed heavily and said, “Yes. Don’t flatter yourself though. You’re not the only reason. Something like 85% of supernatural trauma incidents this past year involved humans.”

“Awwww,” the human said, “Do I cause you psychic damage?”

“What?” Kriklepap said. “No! I mean, at first, but after a while being seen as, well, not scary, grew on me. I started liking it.”

The human reached up and pinched Kriklepap’s cheek. This annoyed Kriklepap, not because of the familiarity, but because it was always a bit jarring when a human reached out and just MADE a ghost materialize, even briefly or partially, just because they wanted to. 

Kriklepap thought about an incident the year before, when a human teenager, not even an adult, had beaten up the sex pest spirit Harltrodger the Molester. He’d exposed himself to her. She’d kicked him in the groin. No spiritual battle training. Just instinct and growing up in a human culture, and she permanently maimed a god of perversion by inverting his own genitals out the back of his head with one kick. The blanket Eldritch classification for Gaia spirits and fae was making more sense the more they thought about it. Anything that could scare a human was worth avoiding.

2.) a variety of drink choices. 
3.) a quiet coffee grinder 
4.) the machine will tolerate if I substitute oat milk for real milk 
5.) ideal budget it’s $2k or less. Not willing to go much over this.

Can make an iced drink (comes out cold) but not required.

- KitchenAid KF8. I loved this so far. The rep in William’s Sonoma told me the quality of coffee is sub par compared to Jura but I thought it tasted fine. 
- Jura E6. Reviews online said it can be frustrating to clean and gets “gunky”. Is this true?
- Terra Kaffe TK-02. Wow this one is so pretty and there’s a $600 coupon right now with a coffee subscription.

1pf31b7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1pf31b7/on_a_group_vacation_and_feeling_invisible/,On a Group Vacation and Feeling Invisible,"I am having an amazing time on my vacation in Japan. I'm 2 years sober and had worries about drinking culture here, but I was able to continue my sobriety and I'm proud! 

Despite that, tonight is our last night here and I decided to join the group for karaoke. The group was already out and about and were probably 45 minutes into karaoke before I got there. 

Although majority of the group doesn't know about my past relationship with alcohol, they do know I don't drink.  I've been going to bars with people here and every time, Ive been able to order non-alcoholic options with no issue (iced oolong has been my go to here!). The group knows not to include me in shots and when someone buys a round, they've been good about asking if I want anything non-alcoholic. 

Well, tonight I get told I need to pay someone over $50 for karaoke. I found that a bit high compared to the other nights we'd done it, so I asked if this price included drinks. This karaoke spot had free self-serve non-alcoholic drinks. They had slushies and various juices, sodas, teas, and coffee. So when the person let me know they got the All You Can Drink alcohol special, I let them know that I don't drink alcohol and that I am fine with paying, but don't think that price is quite fair for me. 

On top of that, a group member pushed me out his way to ask the drinking members if they wanna go play beer pong. Sure he's been drinking, but he just pushed through me so rudely, another group member even said something about it. 

Maybe I'm overreacting, but that got to me and I'm just feeling invisible from this.  

I went back to my hotel room, as the person who pushed me didn't even acknowledge it. Even when I repeatedly said something to them about it. So now I'm just sitting here feeling like a nobody. 
I wouldn't have joined up with them if I knew they got the AYCD special.

Although I am proud of myself for sticking to my sobriety, I'm just feeling down. I know I had a great experience in general, but I just wanted to hang out with folks and just feel down that I'm not a person that has the capacity to be safe with alcohol. ",6,1764960083.0,stopdrinking,7,0.87,False

1pf30gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Moccamaster/comments/1pf30gf/my_disappointed_perspective/,My disappointed perspective,"So a little background - I'm a self professed coffee snob. I own a Fellow Ode 2 with SSP burrs. I typically brew light roasted single origin beans from my local roaster, usually natural process beans if possible since I love the berry flavors that come out. I use an aeropress 95% of the time, or a V60 if I have company to brew more and sometimes a Clever dripper to switch things up on occasion. My aeropress makes easy, consistent brews for 12-16oz cups that I've enjoyed for years.

Even though the adage ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" is always solid wisdom, I decided to splurge on (you guessed it) Amazon's Black Friday sale and got the KBGV Select. Why? Because I liked the idea of brewing a pot of coffee that I could go back to for multiple cups rather than having to do multiple aeropress brews if I wanted more. So the sale seemed like a good time to pull the trigger.

After getting one with a cracked hot plate and returning it, then waiting 6 days for a new one, I finally was able to experiment and play with it today.

And I can't help but feel entirely disappointed.

First of all, the user experience is poor. Every removable component feels cheap, tolerances are all over the place so nothing feels solid when putting them in place. The glass of the carafe scraping on the hot plate feels awful - apparently this gets better with time, but it shouldn't feel this way out of the box. The plastic funnel lid of the carafe doesn't have a very secure attachment and bumped off twice in one day while I was rinsing out the carafe.

Worst of all is the brewing experience. Experimenting with several grind sizes, each time the shower head would coat one side of the grounds and leave the other damp (actually dry my first go around before grinding much finer). The coffee tastes mid at best, and bad at worst. It's like it's somehow bitter AND sour at the same time, likely from some grounds getting over extracted and others extremely under extracted due to the awful design of the shower head. I could stir and manually bloom and such but then what's the point of having an automatic machine at all?

I have no doubt the boiler is robust and likely gets water up to the right temperature. I think the visual design is great. Everything else about this machine is such a disappointment for a $235 product that retails for much more. If I had no idea what a Moccamaster was and someone told me the machine was $45 I'd believe it. Five times that price is crazy, IMO.

I know it's said that people put too high of expectations on this machine, expecting it to be a magic piece of equipment that will provide enlightenment with every sip. I guess I was just expecting a machine that made coffee somewhat comparable to a manual brew, if not quite as good. For $235 it should get at least 95% of the way there. But there are so many mind boggling design decisions with this machine that I can't fathom how they can charge so much and so many people think it's amazing. It's a glorified Mr. Coffee with a better boiler and a poorly designed shower head and user experience. 

I've seen the advice about ratios and grind sizes. And maybe there's some magic configuration that will get me a tasty brew. But with manual methods, it's hard to get *bad* results, even if settings and technique aren't optimal. With this, it seems like unless everything is perfectly dialed in to absolute perfection, the results are going to be severely lacking. And that sucks for something that's $235.

Ultimately I'll be returning it. I'm not here to say anyone who likes the MM is wrong, I'm just sharing my experience in case other people are in the same boat or on the fence about buying one.",0,1764960026.0,Moccamaster,20,0.42,False

Microwave, instant pot and air fryer all offer some degree of time saving, ease of use, or improved results over stove top/oven.  If you don’t think these attributes offer any value, then why not sell your stove/oven and cook over a fire outside? Are you a lazy, no good example of unnecessary consumerism for using a stove? No, you are leveraging technology to enable convenience, save time, and exist as a human in modern society.

1pf2ymg,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1pf2ymg/2_months_postop_success/,2 Months Post-Op success,"I wanted to share my success story since reading other people’s experiences was very helpful to me.

I am a male in my early 30s, normal weight and active (gym 3 days a week, 5k runs on non-gym days). I mostly cook at home and have a balanced healthy diet but few times a month I eat fast food and sweets.

**My Pre-Op Symptoms:**  
I dealt with on-and-off simptoms for 3 years. I never had ""serious"" acute attacks and never went to the ER, but my quality of life was suffering since it would happen most days and it was hard mentally to be reminded of it.

* **Pain:** 2-4/10 Pain/pressure in the URQ (worse when lying down) accompanied by occasional right-sided back pain, chest pain, and stomach bloating. I often had a sensation that ""something was stuck,"" likely caused by tiny stones or sludge creating partial blockages.
* **Digestion:** Yellow floating stool more often than not, lots of horrible-smelling gas, fatigue, and occasional nausea and fatigue. I rarely had yellow liquid diarrhea, but it happened a few times.
* **Triggers:** Most food didn't impact me, but coffee, and fatty movie popcorn made it worse.

Because my symptoms weren't ""life-threatening,"" I waited a long time. I tried several suppliments: TUDCA, milk thistle, magnesium glycinate, lecithin, beetroot and apple cidar vinegar. While the symptoms came less often, they never disappeared, and the polyps/stones didn't shrink even after a year of supplements.

My motivation was also genetic. My dad passed away from a rare appendix cancer because it wasn't operated on soon enough, so I didn't want to take any chances with the polyps. Both my grandmas had theirs out and my grandpa had his out in his 40s he is 93 now and eats more than me!

**Diagnosis & Testing:**  
I did bunch of tests: Many ultrasounds as initially I was tracking my polyps, gastroscopy with biopsy, colonoscopy, MRI, MRCP, and extensive blood, urine and stool tests.

* HIDA scans aren't available in my country, but my GI performed an ultrasound before and after a fatty meal. My gallbladder only contracted a small amount.
* Everything else was clear except for 2-3 small 3-6mm polyps/stones in the neck and body, some sludge, and low Vitamin A and E. (My fat-soluble D and K levels were fine, but I was supplementing them).

**Post-Op Recovery:**  
Surgery was easy, done in half an hour, kept me overnight since thats the routine. First week was tough since my abdomen was hurting from incisions but I was driving to get dressing changed in about 3 days. I definitely recommend getting a **wedge pillow!**, lying down fully stretched was awful. One week after surgery, I had a scare with strong abdominal pain and went to the ER fearing a bile leak. The ultrasound was clear. The pain didn't return, so the doctor suspects it was either severe reflux or a loose polyp/stone passing into a duct during surgery. I also had some reflux for 2-3 weeks but that went away with a PPI.

**Current Status (2+ Months later):**

* **Pain:** The URQ, chest, and back aching and pressure is gone. Thought it wasn't gone right away, I was still having some pain the first month.
* **Digestion:** My stool has never been better! It is finally brown, solid, and sinking. I was surprised by the drastic change; the very first stool 3 days post-op was normal and has been ever since. Few times it was light brown but never yellow like before. It feels like I am finally digesting fats properly. Most often I poop once per day in the morning soon after I wake up or after breakfast. Before surgery I would go a few times and it would come out partly.
* **Lingering issues:** I am still a little gassy sometimes, but the horrible smell is gone. I had beans with sausage the other day and girlfriend wasn't happy.

**Diet:**  
I’m eating everything I ate before. I took it easy for the first week, but I didn't do any low-fat diets before or after surgery. Recently I had a whole prosciutto pizza, tiramisu cake, and black coffee in one sitting, followed by a 3-hour car ride and I was totally fine.

**Conclusion:**  
Of course, I wish I didn't have to do it. It is never a good idea to take out organs without eliminating other causes first. Try suppliments, maybe they will work for you. I looked also into stone only removal but it wasn't a good fit for me and it carries its own risks. But considering my quality of life now, I am very glad I did it.",3,1764959905.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

I'll probably be downvoted for my arrogance but just wanted to put this post out there. 

I got a first from Oxford and came from a grammar school so was extremely pompous about having significant academic achievement despite not coming from an affluent family. I worked hard and got a first in a difficult STEM subject. 

After graduating I started working in the corporate world in the city and was disappointed to see that some of the other grads went to low ranked unis like Aston and Lancaster. If I worked so hard to get a great, high paying grad job then it  did rub me the wrong way that someone who messed around in school and got poor grades and ended up at the likes of Lancaster/Aston University would be able to get the same grad scheme. 

I always felt superior to everyone else because I went to the best uni and most people there were UCL/Durham/Bristol types. I basically presented myself as an 'intellectual among the riff raff' which could be seen as pretentious and rub people the wrong way. 

Over the years I saw my colleagues from lower ranked unis get promoted quicker than me, get larger bonuses and bigger raises in salary. They won the internal awards and the senior execs at the firm would take them out for coffee a lot to have chats about being future managing directors. 

I thought my first class Oxford degree would be worshipped among the lower class universities, and 18 year old me who came from an average working class family thought I was unstoppable being the first person in my family to go to uni at all, let alone getting a first from Oxford. 

Most of the grads in my cohort have been promoted twice while I'm at the same level and many of them are at double my pay. I'm good at my job and always deliver good work so it's not like they can fire me for incompetence, but it's clear the senior execs don't like me.

Here’s everything I ate today (being full honest):

Breakfast: 1 egg, oatmeal with milk , 2 jujubes and some goji berries

Went for a workout and did not snack afterwards like I usually do!

Lunch: 1 sweet potato, 3 spoonfuls of beans, 1 can of sardines, 1 egg, and an iced coffee

Post-lunch snack: A bowl of blueberries and about 8 grapes

Evening snack (wanted something sweet): 1 nectarine and 1 apple (so glad that I didn’t reach for junk food)

Dinner: Rice with stir-fried veggies (spinach, mushrooms, broccoli), kimchi and grilled chicken

Post-dinner snack: About 8 grapes and an apple (probably didn’t need it since dinner was already enough and I was feeling a little too full after having the fruits, but still way better than bingeing)

Overall, it was a GREAT day , no bingeing at all!
One thing I want to improve is stop reaching for more food when I’m already comfortably full and actually satisfied (It was a habit). But I’m really proud of today and excited to keep going because this feeling of progress is amazing.

1pf2pyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1pf2pyc/the_phantom_cabinet_2_chapter_3_part_2/,The Phantom Cabinet 2: Chapter 3 (Part 2),"Sure, Carter had felt no small measure of guilt after abandoning his only child—particularly after a dishonorably discharged ex-Marine murdered Douglas in front of the Oceanside Credit Union—but his self-reproach was more than offset by the relief and relaxation he attained with a specter-free existence. Nights of lovemaking with Elaina segued to unbroken sleep. Strangers and acquaintances were far friendlier without “Ghost Boy” around. 

 

He still visited his son’s grave at Timeless Knolls Memorial Park twice a year, on Douglas’ birthday and Christmas—speaking to the corpse underfoot as if it could hear him and actually cared about the trivialities of Carter’s life—but he possessed not one photograph of Douglas, and barely remembered what he’d looked like. So too did he eschew any documentation of his time with Martha, his first wife.  

 

As with Douglas’ grave, however, he began to visit Martha from time to time. Seated at her bedside—in her cramped Milford Asylum room, with an orderly lingering in the hallway—he attempted to coax signs of awareness from the nonresponsive. 

 

Soothingly, he spoke of bygone days, the years they’d been so in love, of pancake breakfasts and formal events and snuggling on the sofa, lost in each other’s presences. Exasperated, he elaborated upon Douglas’ two deaths, demanding that she let the past go so as to heal her broken mind. Contrite, he explained his acquisition of a doctor’s certification, which attested that Martha’s mental state was unlikely to get better any time soon, which he’d use to file for a divorce. Later, he’d told Martha of his marriage to Elaina. No response. 

 

A malignancy seemed to churn, unseen, in the shadows around her. Carter’s skin crawled in Martha’s presence. Had she suddenly shrieked, he might have leapt out of it. 

 

Twice, he’d been dominated by her room’s blighted atmosphere. Seizing Martha by the shoulders, he’d shaken her. “Wake up, damn you!” he’d hollered, as her head flopped fore and aft, unresponsive, until he’d been pried away from the woman and escorted from the asylum, with threats of lost visiting privileges sounding hollowly in his ears. 

 

It had been nearly seven months since his last visit. He’d been meaning to make the drive—had made appointments in his head and skipped them, repeatedly—but was too comfortable in his suburban husband routine. The Milford Asylum experience was akin to enduring the same open-casket funeral over and over. Carter always drank a few shots of Jameson beforehand, to steel his resolve, and afterward got entirely blotto, so as to sleep. 

 

Within Martha’s withered, slack features, he saw what remained of his younger self’s naive notion of starting a family. All of Douglas’ lost potential was interred there, as was every bit of the love that Carter had felt for the two of them. 

 

If she ever emerged from her catatonia, he’d have to explain their divorce. He’d have to make Martha understand that they’d never live together again, even if she regained mental health. He’d attempt to be her friend, in some nebulous way, though the sight of her sickened him. He’d been in the delivery room when she’d throttled their newborn, after all. That memory had never slipped from his mind. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Fortunately for Carter, his days as an air conditioning engineer were long behind him. A few weeks after Douglas was laid to rest, he ridded himself of every item remaining in his unoccupied home, from the comics beneath his dead son’s bed to the bed itself, from the plantation shutters to the refrigerator—selling certain objects, giving away others, driving the rest to the landfill. 

 

While cleaning out the house, working long hours solo, Carter was astounded to find the place warm and stuffy. Neither cold spots nor winds of unknown origin conjured shivers. No phantoms capered in his peripheral vision; no mouthless voices made him revolve toward empty space. Still, he wished to be rid of the residence, as any good memories associated with it had long since been swallowed by the bad ones.

 

Selling the home for six figures had gone smoothly enough. Setting a portion of those funds aside for Elaina and his wedding—he’d yet to propose at the time, but certainly planned to—he decided to quit his job and live off of the rest. 

 

But uninvested currency is lazy currency, as many well know, and, succumbing to the preoccupation of most men, finding his days otherwise rudderless, Carter yearned for greater financial success. With neither of them working, Elaina and he often sniped at one another, and bore grudges over the most trivial matters. If he couldn’t find a solitary way to spend his time, to counterpoint those many minutes they spent together, their relationship would sour. Thus, he turned to long-distance real estate investing. 

 

Home prices being far too high in California for his liking, Carter contacted a Florida-based real estate agent, to whom he explained his intention of purchasing a home in need of light renovations, hiring a contractor to fix it up, then flipping the residence for a fast profit. He made sure to emphasize the fact that, should the agent produce a lucrative recommendation, Carter would be sure to turn to him for future property purchases. 

 

By the end of that day, not only did Carter have a half-dozen properties to choose from, complete with background info such as neighborhood crime rates and proximities to schools and shopping centers, but he had the names and phone numbers of the same number of contractors, all of whom the agent swore were bastions of integrity and cost-effectiveness. 

 

Eventually, after much hemming and hawing, Carter settled on a two-bedroom, one-bathroom Jacksonville residence for his inaugural investment. Studying photos his real estate agent emailed him, he decided that the place needed a paintjob, roof retiling, a marble backsplash in the kitchen, a new refrigerator and oven, and tile flooring to replace its cheap linoleum. He contacted the nearest three contractors for cost and time estimates, and settled on the cheapest, fastest responder. 

 

A few months later, Carter had successfully renovated and sold the place for a profit of nearly $100,000, without ever setting foot in the state of Florida. Realizing how easily he could make money without leaving his house—while wearing pajamas all day long, if he desired to—he was hooked. 

 

Initially focusing his efforts on a single house at a time, so as not to be overwhelmed, he went from city to city—Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach—selecting properties in need of light renovations, accruing profits from each. The vital repairs varied. Sometimes, doors, toilets, or cabinets needed replacing. Occasionally, lighting was the issue. When a place, otherwise rendered homeowner-friendly, still lacked a certain je ne sais quoi, he sprung for nonessential upgrades—skylights, heated flooring, accent wall stonework—to improve its wow factor and reduce its time on the market.

 

Years passed and, eventually, Carter turned his eye to Midwestern states: Ohio, Indiana and Missouri. Abhorring the idea of dealing with property managers and tenants on a regular basis, he avoided the steady stream of income that renting properties might have provided. 

 

Buy, renovate, flip…buy, renovate, flip. Profit kept inflowing; Elaina and Carter’s joint checking and savings accounts swelled. Naturally, they purchased new vehicles: a Mercedes-Benz E-Class for Carter, a BMW X5 for Elaina. Their wardrobes improved, as did Elaina’s jewelry collection. They dined out often and tipped generously. 

 

Better yet were the frequent vacations—Hawaii, New Zealand, Mallorca, Belize, Paris, Jamaica, French Polynesia and others—during which they immersed themselves in tourist attractions and off-the-beaten-track experiences.

 

Comfortable enough in Oceanside, they spoke not of relocating to a more affluent SoCal city. Instead, Carter and Elaina spent lavishly to enhance their own home. 

 

Upgrading their appliances to top-of-the-line equipment was only the beginning. A crocodile leather sofa now occupied their living room, facing an entertainment center whose pièce de résistance was an eighty-six-inch 4K television. Its sound thundered and screeched from a $4,000 wireless surround sound system. A matching TV could be found in their bedroom, which they watched from their Duxiana bed. They replaced every inch of their flooring with porcelain tiles, with electric underfloor heating keeping their feet warm at all times. They replaced their countertops with granite, and added under-cabinet lighting in the kitchen. 

 

In their backyard, they shelled out over $100,000 for an in-ground pool and jacuzzi, complete with a waterfall and breathtaking rock formations. Neither of them swam much, but they climbed into the jacuzzi at least once a week, typically with beer bottles or wine glasses in their hands. Their $10,000 American Muscle Grill evoked the 1969 Shelby GT 350 Mustang it had been modeled after.

 

Indeed, if they lacked any creature comforts, the Stantons were unaware of them. With myriad channels to choose from, hundreds of social media acquaintances, and the means to visit any location on Earth any time they desired to, rarely did they feel boredom or jealousy. Their rambunctious-but-adoring canine, a corgi named Maggie, more than made up for their lack of children, they attested. Walking her once a day inspired them to exercise.

 

Rather than succumb to the antisocial tendencies that afflict many individuals of advanced age, they maintained shallow friendships with half a dozen local couples, hosting and attending dinner parties with regularity. They were friendly with their neighbors, even babysat their children on occasion. On Halloween, they dressed in matching costumes and handed out full-size candy bars to all comers, though there were less trick-or-treaters every year. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Groaning theatrically for an audience of none, Carter eventually climbed out of bed. Soon, he’d check his email. He’d been in contact with a real estate agent in Kenton, Ohio, and the man had promised to send him documentation of properties that fit Carter’s criteria. 

 

A savvy investor, Carter wanted more than webpage bullet points and a handful of photographs to consider. In fact, he demanded a video tour of each property, shot with the agent’s cellphone, so that he might appraise the flow of the residence. He wanted to know whether knocking down a wall or adding a room would add significant value, and also which features were popular with homeowners in the area. Later, once he’d selected a probable purchase, he’d get a few contractors to inspect the place and provide him with a list of suggested repairs, along with the costs of completing them. Whichever contractor seemed the most valuable would be hired. Thus was Carter’s modus operandi. 

 

He spent time on the toilet, he shaved, and he showered. He wandered into the kitchen and manipulated his Keurig. Soon, a steamy mug of Cinnamon Dolce coffee, sweetened with pumpkin spice creamer, was his for the sipping. He carried it to the kitchen island, where Elaina awaited, drinking a similar beverage, otherwise occupied with inactivity.

 

Seating himself, sparing a moment to scratch Maggie’s head as she gamboled about his legs, he asked his wife, “So, what shall we have for breakfast? Or is it brunch time already? Eggs and toast? Bacon and waffles? Pancakes? We could go out, if you’re interested.”

 

“Oh, I don’t know,” she replied, playfully. “We both could stand to lose a few pounds. Perhaps we should skip it.”

 

“And wait until lunch or, God forbid, dinner to dine? Come back to your senses, woman. We’re not as young as we once were. We could starve to death.” He glugged down some coffee and sighed with perfect satisfaction. 

 

“Youth is a state of mind, Carter. We need to stop behaving like fogies. In fact, I’ll tell you what. I’ll fix us some breakfast, whatever you want, but only if we can go ice-skating afterwards. There’s that rink in Carlsbad. What’s it called again? Icetown?”

 

“Ice skating? Either you’re kidding or you’re some deranged doppelganger of the woman I married. I went ice-skating exactly once in my life, when I was nine, on my birthday. I slipped and smacked my head so hard I saw stars. Never again.”

 

“Oh, don’t be such a spoilsport. We’ll buy you a helmet on the way, even kneepads, if you’re so frightened.”

 

“Hey, I never said I was frightened. The word you’re looking for is ‘pragmatic.’”

 

“More like ‘prigmatic.’ Come on, it’ll be fun. If you hurt your poor little noggin, I’ll drive you to the doctor’s office. I’ll even buy you a lollypop, in fact an entire case of them, for being my brave little boy.” 

 

“Lollypop? How about anal?”

 

“You want me to peg you? Did you buy a strap-on without telling me?”

 

“That’s not what I meant. You know the kind of man you married. I’m not some…”

 

“Good-time Charlie?”

 

“Exactly. Not that I’m opposed to every type of fun, mind you.”

 

“Just any and all activities that might land you an owie?” She sniggered.

 

“Yeah, laugh it up, sugarplum. So…weren’t we talking about food? I’m growing hungrier by the moment.”

 

“Well, I could go for some eggs over easy, I guess. Maybe a little bacon.”

 

Unfortunately, Carter and Elaina’s dining was delayed by four rapid, no-nonsense thumps. Instantly alert, Maggie bounded to the front door, barking. 

 

“Are you expecting someone?” Carter asked his wife, eyebrow raised.

 

She shook her head negative.

 

Affecting a cowboy drawl, he said, “Well, I guess I better learn exactly who’s come a-knockin’.”

 

“Go get ’em, partnah.”

 

Carter ambled to the door, scooping Maggie from the floor with one arm as its opposite turned back the deadbolt. “Shh, shh,” he murmured to the corgi. “Behave, or I’ll lock you in the backyard.”

 

Opening the door, he nearly leapt out of his own flesh, nearly lost his grip on his wriggling canine. Four mirrored lenses, perhaps a foot above his eye level, reflected his agitation. Framing the aviator glasses were close-cropped, dark hairstyles and clean-shaven, square jaws. 

 

If not for their dissimilar complexions—cream and mocha, to be exact—the visitors might’ve been brothers. Each wore a dark suit, a white shirt, and a necktie. So polished were their outfits that every integrant that might catch the sunlight—their lapel pins, their tie clips, their cufflinks, even the toes of their wingtip shoes—shone most splendidly. 

 

“Mr. Carter Stanton?” said the Caucasian.

 

“I am he. And who, might I ask—”

 

“I’m Special Agent Charles Sharpe. This is Special Agent Norton Stevens.” Badges and IDs materialized, then vanished, before Carter could properly register them. “Might we come in and chat? We’ve some questions to ask, and today sure is a hot one.”

 

Carter’s stomach dropped. FBI agents at his house carried dark connotations in their pockets, he assumed. “Uh, I guess…I mean, sure, follow me,” he said.

 

Stepping over the threshold, both agents pocketed their sunglasses. Carter decided to lead them into the kitchen, where most of his mugful of coffee yet awaited. He’d need it to irrigate his suddenly far-too-dry mouth.

 

Though Carter couldn’t recall anything he’d done in years that was even slightly illegal, he was nervous all the same. “So, can I get you fellas something to drink?” he asked, keeping his tone even, unruffled. Rounding the dining room, he was pleased to find it spotless. Into the kitchen he strode.

 

The agents started to answer but were interrupted by an “Eep!” Carter had forgotten about Elaina. Though he’d dressed in jeans and an old shirt post-shower, she remained in the nightgown and panties she’d slept in. 

 

“Damn you, Carter!” she shouted, fleeing from the kitchen, toward their bedroom, a study in unbounded jiggling. The agents, to their credit, averted their eyes. 

 

“Sorry about that,” said Carter. “We slept in this morning…are still waking up, in fact.” He set Maggie on the floor. She sniffed the visitors’ ankles, and then scampered off. “Anyway, like I was asking a moment ago, are you thirsty? We have coffee, juice and soda…or something harder, if you’re of a certain disposition.” 

 

“We’re alright,” said Special Agent Stevens with weighted enunciation, swiping his hand through the air as if batting away the question. His partner didn’t seem to mind being spoken for.

 

They seated themselves around the kitchen island, with Carter reclaiming the chair he’d vacated, facing his rapidly cooling coffee, and the agents settling themselves opposite him, all the better to study his face. Sharpe’s eyes were blue; Stevens’ were hazel. Both pairs stared with an intensity that bored into Carter’s psyche. 

 

After gulping down a mouthful of coffee to fortify himself, Carter found words surging up from his throat: “So, I didn’t actually have to let you in, right? You don’t have a warrant, do you? If I don’t like your questions, I don’t have to answer them? I mean…I can call an attorney first, can’t I?” *Now I surely sound guilty*, he thought, as perspiration seeped from his face and his heartbeat accelerated. *They’ll arrest me for some serial killing I’ve never heard of, and that’ll be the end of it. The end of me.*

 

“Sure, you can go that route,” Sharpe answered. “Clam up and call a lawyer, if it makes you feel better. Tell us to leave and we’ll do exactly that. The thing is, though, Mr. Stanton, we’re not accusing *you* of anything. Like I said, we just have some questions, and then we’ll be on our way.”

 

“Oh, well, I guess that’s all right.” 

 

“Great to hear,” said Stevens, all friendly baritone. “At any rate, I’m sure that you’ve already figured out the reason for our visit.”

 

Surprised, nearly spitting out coffee before remembering to swallow it, Carter said, “Not a clue.”

 

“It’s about your ex-wife,” said Sharpe.

 

“Martha? My God, what happened? Did she finally wake up?”

 

“You mean…nobody called you?”

 

“Called me? No, I haven’t been contacted by anyone from Milford Asylum in a while. I was just there, though…half a year ago, give or take.”

 

“A definite oversight,” said Stevens. “You’re listed as her emergency contact. Somebody definitely should’ve been in touch by now.”

 

“Listen,” said Carter. “I have no idea what you’re talking about. Would one of you please explain what the hell is going on here, before my skull detonates?”

 

Ignoring his query, Sharpe asked another of his own: “So, Martha hasn’t called you, or showed up at your door?”

 

“Listen, man, the last time that I saw her, she was completely catatonic. She hasn’t walked, talked, or fed herself in years. I really have no clue what you’re getting at.”

 

“You haven’t been watching the news?” said Stevens, raising a skeptical eyebrow. “You don’t read the paper? It’s kind of a big story.”

 

“Hey, seriously, I’ve been busy. And who wants to follow the news, anyway? It’s nothing but political insanity and PC propaganda these days. Now please, for the last time, explain yourselves. The suspense is killing me.” 

 

The agents met each other’s eyes for a dilated moment, as if debating who’d be the bad news deliverer. Finally, Stevens cleared his throat, so as to say, “Well, Mr. Carter…sorry, it’s been a long day already; I meant to say Mr. Stanton. At any rate, the reason we paid you a visit is because every single person in Milford Asylum—patients, staff and visitors—was found dead, aside from Martha Drexel, your ex-wife. She disappeared from the premises, and hasn’t been seen or heard from since. There was some kind of bloodlust insanity. Everyone slaughtered each other. Corpses were piled in the dayroom.” He paused to let the info sink in. 

 

Carter’s head reeled. The kitchen’s far angles seemed to draw closer. Had he awakened from one nightmare into a worse one? It was as if hours bled out before he again summoned speech. “My God,” he said. “So, Martha was abducted?”

 

“We’re still attempting to determine that,” said Sharpe.

 

“Attempting? I’m pretty sure that the place has security cameras. I mean, doesn’t it? I remember seeing ’em there.”

 

“Correct, Mr. Stanton. There are, in fact, surveillance cameras monitoring the hallways, nurses station, and common rooms at all times…everywhere but the patients’ rooms. It’s the damnedest thing, though. Somehow, some way, for roughly forty-eight hours—a time frame that encapsulated the atrocity—those cameras recorded only green fog of indeterminable origin.”

 

“Fog? Inside the building?”

 

“We know how that sounds,” said Stevens. “But it’s entirely true, sir. At three in the morning, they all hazed over, all at once. By the time whatever was affecting them cleared up, everyone but your ex-wife was dead.”

 

“Are you sure about that?”

 

“Sure about what?” both agents asked in unison. 

 

“That Martha’s still alive. Maybe someone just stashed her corpse somewhere.”

 

“Could be,” said Stevens, absentmindedly massaging his temple, “but until we find a body, we’ll proceed as if she’s still living. Right now, we have nothing else to go on.”

 

Sharpe broke in with, “We were hoping that you’ve seen or heard from Martha. It’s too bad that you haven’t. Still, perhaps you can provide us with info of some use. Out of everyone we might talk to, you knew her the best, surely.”

 

“Her years-ago sane self, sure. But if she’s really awake now, who knows what she’s like? In the delivery room, all those years ago, she became something feral, something unrecognizable, rasping out, ‘You killed my baby,’ even as she herself strangled Douglas, our newborn son. Afterward, she retreated so deep into her own head that she never returned to me, never spoke a word or moved so much as a finger in acknowledgment of anything. If she did finally come back to herself, after all this time, is she the loving, beautiful lady I married or the madwoman, the child-killing lunatic who hardly seemed to exist on the same Earth as the rest of us?”

 

“Good point,” said Sharpe. “Still, people attempting to reconnect with society often visit old haunts. Are there any places you can think of that held special significance to Martha? Good memories or bad, just as long as they’re meaningful.”

 

“Well, there’s our old house, of course, on Calle Tranquila.”

 

“We checked it out,” said Stevens. “The family that lives there now hasn’t seen her.”

 

“Huh. In that case, how about the hospital? Oceanside Memorial Medical Center. That place has been abandoned for years, ever since the ghost incident. Nobody will buy the site. It would make a perfect hidey-hole, if Martha’s not too superstitious.”

 

Impatiently, Sharpe waved his hand. “We toured it already. Spooky, sure, but no signs of life. The security patrol we spoke with said that even skateboarders avoid the place. Imagine that.”

 

“Okay, well, we used to frequent the beach in the summertime…sometimes the pier, sometimes the harbor. Before Martha became pregnant with Douglas, when we still socialized with friends, we’d occasionally go to Brengle Terrace Park for barbecues. That’s in—”

 

“Vista, we know,” said Stevens, interrupting. “Was Martha particularly close to any of these friends of yours? Or were there any memorable fights?”

 

“No, not really. She kept all social interactions limited to boring small talk. A shy one, my Martha, definitely not into fighting. In fact, I don’t recall her ever raising her voice in anger to anyone. Even when we argued, she retained her composure.” He shook his head and muttered, “I don’t know what happened to her.”

 

“What about family? Any in the area? Was Martha close with her parents and siblings? Her cousins, perhaps?”

 

“No, Martha’s dad died years ago, and the rest of her family are East Coasters. They hardly kept in touch, save for a phone call or email every now and then. After Martha’s breakdown, they severed all ties with me. They never even met our son Douglas.”

 

“I see,” said Sharpe. He stood and sighed, as did his partner, seconds later. “Well, we appreciate you answering our questions, Mr. Stanton, though I can’t say we gained much from this conversation…unless Martha decides to show up at the beach or park sometime soon. Still, I’ll leave you with my number. If she pays you a visit or contacts you in any way, please don’t hesitate to call me.” From his wallet came a business card, upon which the golden FBI shield was printed alongside Sharpe’s phone number and email address. 

 

Carter shook their hands and accompanied the pair to the door. Watching the agents climb into a blue sedan and drive off, he was surprised to find himself shivering. *Martha, what has become of you?* he wondered. *Did you kill a bunch of people and flee the scene, or are you the victim this time? Are you even alive, or just a decoration in some serial killer’s living room?*

 

He closed the door. Swiveling on his heels, he nearly shrieked to find Elaina standing before him, now fully dressed. She’d donned a floral print dress, brushed her hair, and applied just enough makeup to give her a natural look. “Those serious-looking guys in the suits,” she demanded, “who were they?” 

 

“A couple of FBI agents,” he answered. 

 

Elaina’s eyes went wide. “What did they want? You’re not a secret serial murderer, are you? Or some kind of kiddie porn connoisseur?”

 

“Come on now, honey. I rarely leave the house without you…and you’re peeking over my shoulder half the time I’m online. I don’t have enough privacy for such activities.” 

 

“Otherwise you’d partake?”

 

“Of course not.” He took a deep breath and began to recount his conversation with the agents.

They put me on latuda. The past three years I have been on a health venture where I have been diagnosed with pots and a connective tissue disorder. This disorder has stolen my ability to exercise, drive, and work. I am in isolation 8 hours a day 5 days week. My muscles are always tight, my skin on fire, and I have zero appetite. I am loosing no weight. I keep showing up to the doctor and find myself bed ridden. I don’t feel sad or anxious, it’s my body doing its own thing. I can’t sleep at night because I’m afraid I’m going to die. I check my ecg on my watch, blood pressure, and pulse- I tell myself I’m fine and push through it. Ativan does NOTHING for my episodes. I feel faint,dizzy,chest pain, and cannot think straight. I felt the same way while on latuda, but atleast I was able to make it one mile down the road to sip coffee with my kiddos. I am completely deregulated. I walk outside and immediately get dizzy. I try to go for a walk and all my muscles tighten causing me to black out.

1pf2oxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/joinmeatthecampfire/comments/1pf2oxn/the_phantom_cabinet_2_chapter_3_part_2/,The Phantom Cabinet 2: Chapter 3 (Part 2),"Sure, Carter had felt no small measure of guilt after abandoning his only child—particularly after a dishonorably discharged ex-Marine murdered Douglas in front of the Oceanside Credit Union—but his self-reproach was more than offset by the relief and relaxation he attained with a specter-free existence. Nights of lovemaking with Elaina segued to unbroken sleep. Strangers and acquaintances were far friendlier without “Ghost Boy” around. 

 

He still visited his son’s grave at Timeless Knolls Memorial Park twice a year, on Douglas’ birthday and Christmas—speaking to the corpse underfoot as if it could hear him and actually cared about the trivialities of Carter’s life—but he possessed not one photograph of Douglas, and barely remembered what he’d looked like. So too did he eschew any documentation of his time with Martha, his first wife.  

 

As with Douglas’ grave, however, he began to visit Martha from time to time. Seated at her bedside—in her cramped Milford Asylum room, with an orderly lingering in the hallway—he attempted to coax signs of awareness from the nonresponsive. 

 

Soothingly, he spoke of bygone days, the years they’d been so in love, of pancake breakfasts and formal events and snuggling on the sofa, lost in each other’s presences. Exasperated, he elaborated upon Douglas’ two deaths, demanding that she let the past go so as to heal her broken mind. Contrite, he explained his acquisition of a doctor’s certification, which attested that Martha’s mental state was unlikely to get better any time soon, which he’d use to file for a divorce. Later, he’d told Martha of his marriage to Elaina. No response. 

 

A malignancy seemed to churn, unseen, in the shadows around her. Carter’s skin crawled in Martha’s presence. Had she suddenly shrieked, he might have leapt out of it. 

 

Twice, he’d been dominated by her room’s blighted atmosphere. Seizing Martha by the shoulders, he’d shaken her. “Wake up, damn you!” he’d hollered, as her head flopped fore and aft, unresponsive, until he’d been pried away from the woman and escorted from the asylum, with threats of lost visiting privileges sounding hollowly in his ears. 

 

It had been nearly seven months since his last visit. He’d been meaning to make the drive—had made appointments in his head and skipped them, repeatedly—but was too comfortable in his suburban husband routine. The Milford Asylum experience was akin to enduring the same open-casket funeral over and over. Carter always drank a few shots of Jameson beforehand, to steel his resolve, and afterward got entirely blotto, so as to sleep. 

 

Within Martha’s withered, slack features, he saw what remained of his younger self’s naive notion of starting a family. All of Douglas’ lost potential was interred there, as was every bit of the love that Carter had felt for the two of them. 

 

If she ever emerged from her catatonia, he’d have to explain their divorce. He’d have to make Martha understand that they’d never live together again, even if she regained mental health. He’d attempt to be her friend, in some nebulous way, though the sight of her sickened him. He’d been in the delivery room when she’d throttled their newborn, after all. That memory had never slipped from his mind. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Fortunately for Carter, his days as an air conditioning engineer were long behind him. A few weeks after Douglas was laid to rest, he ridded himself of every item remaining in his unoccupied home, from the comics beneath his dead son’s bed to the bed itself, from the plantation shutters to the refrigerator—selling certain objects, giving away others, driving the rest to the landfill. 

 

While cleaning out the house, working long hours solo, Carter was astounded to find the place warm and stuffy. Neither cold spots nor winds of unknown origin conjured shivers. No phantoms capered in his peripheral vision; no mouthless voices made him revolve toward empty space. Still, he wished to be rid of the residence, as any good memories associated with it had long since been swallowed by the bad ones.

 

Selling the home for six figures had gone smoothly enough. Setting a portion of those funds aside for Elaina and his wedding—he’d yet to propose at the time, but certainly planned to—he decided to quit his job and live off of the rest. 

 

But uninvested currency is lazy currency, as many well know, and, succumbing to the preoccupation of most men, finding his days otherwise rudderless, Carter yearned for greater financial success. With neither of them working, Elaina and he often sniped at one another, and bore grudges over the most trivial matters. If he couldn’t find a solitary way to spend his time, to counterpoint those many minutes they spent together, their relationship would sour. Thus, he turned to long-distance real estate investing. 

 

Home prices being far too high in California for his liking, Carter contacted a Florida-based real estate agent, to whom he explained his intention of purchasing a home in need of light renovations, hiring a contractor to fix it up, then flipping the residence for a fast profit. He made sure to emphasize the fact that, should the agent produce a lucrative recommendation, Carter would be sure to turn to him for future property purchases. 

 

By the end of that day, not only did Carter have a half-dozen properties to choose from, complete with background info such as neighborhood crime rates and proximities to schools and shopping centers, but he had the names and phone numbers of the same number of contractors, all of whom the agent swore were bastions of integrity and cost-effectiveness. 

 

Eventually, after much hemming and hawing, Carter settled on a two-bedroom, one-bathroom Jacksonville residence for his inaugural investment. Studying photos his real estate agent emailed him, he decided that the place needed a paintjob, roof retiling, a marble backsplash in the kitchen, a new refrigerator and oven, and tile flooring to replace its cheap linoleum. He contacted the nearest three contractors for cost and time estimates, and settled on the cheapest, fastest responder. 

 

A few months later, Carter had successfully renovated and sold the place for a profit of nearly $100,000, without ever setting foot in the state of Florida. Realizing how easily he could make money without leaving his house—while wearing pajamas all day long, if he desired to—he was hooked. 

 

Initially focusing his efforts on a single house at a time, so as not to be overwhelmed, he went from city to city—Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach—selecting properties in need of light renovations, accruing profits from each. The vital repairs varied. Sometimes, doors, toilets, or cabinets needed replacing. Occasionally, lighting was the issue. When a place, otherwise rendered homeowner-friendly, still lacked a certain je ne sais quoi, he sprung for nonessential upgrades—skylights, heated flooring, accent wall stonework—to improve its wow factor and reduce its time on the market.

 

Years passed and, eventually, Carter turned his eye to Midwestern states: Ohio, Indiana and Missouri. Abhorring the idea of dealing with property managers and tenants on a regular basis, he avoided the steady stream of income that renting properties might have provided. 

 

Buy, renovate, flip…buy, renovate, flip. Profit kept inflowing; Elaina and Carter’s joint checking and savings accounts swelled. Naturally, they purchased new vehicles: a Mercedes-Benz E-Class for Carter, a BMW X5 for Elaina. Their wardrobes improved, as did Elaina’s jewelry collection. They dined out often and tipped generously. 

 

Better yet were the frequent vacations—Hawaii, New Zealand, Mallorca, Belize, Paris, Jamaica, French Polynesia and others—during which they immersed themselves in tourist attractions and off-the-beaten-track experiences.

 

Comfortable enough in Oceanside, they spoke not of relocating to a more affluent SoCal city. Instead, Carter and Elaina spent lavishly to enhance their own home. 

 

Upgrading their appliances to top-of-the-line equipment was only the beginning. A crocodile leather sofa now occupied their living room, facing an entertainment center whose pièce de résistance was an eighty-six-inch 4K television. Its sound thundered and screeched from a $4,000 wireless surround sound system. A matching TV could be found in their bedroom, which they watched from their Duxiana bed. They replaced every inch of their flooring with porcelain tiles, with electric underfloor heating keeping their feet warm at all times. They replaced their countertops with granite, and added under-cabinet lighting in the kitchen. 

 

In their backyard, they shelled out over $100,000 for an in-ground pool and jacuzzi, complete with a waterfall and breathtaking rock formations. Neither of them swam much, but they climbed into the jacuzzi at least once a week, typically with beer bottles or wine glasses in their hands. Their $10,000 American Muscle Grill evoked the 1969 Shelby GT 350 Mustang it had been modeled after.

 

Indeed, if they lacked any creature comforts, the Stantons were unaware of them. With myriad channels to choose from, hundreds of social media acquaintances, and the means to visit any location on Earth any time they desired to, rarely did they feel boredom or jealousy. Their rambunctious-but-adoring canine, a corgi named Maggie, more than made up for their lack of children, they attested. Walking her once a day inspired them to exercise.

 

Rather than succumb to the antisocial tendencies that afflict many individuals of advanced age, they maintained shallow friendships with half a dozen local couples, hosting and attending dinner parties with regularity. They were friendly with their neighbors, even babysat their children on occasion. On Halloween, they dressed in matching costumes and handed out full-size candy bars to all comers, though there were less trick-or-treaters every year. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Groaning theatrically for an audience of none, Carter eventually climbed out of bed. Soon, he’d check his email. He’d been in contact with a real estate agent in Kenton, Ohio, and the man had promised to send him documentation of properties that fit Carter’s criteria. 

 

A savvy investor, Carter wanted more than webpage bullet points and a handful of photographs to consider. In fact, he demanded a video tour of each property, shot with the agent’s cellphone, so that he might appraise the flow of the residence. He wanted to know whether knocking down a wall or adding a room would add significant value, and also which features were popular with homeowners in the area. Later, once he’d selected a probable purchase, he’d get a few contractors to inspect the place and provide him with a list of suggested repairs, along with the costs of completing them. Whichever contractor seemed the most valuable would be hired. Thus was Carter’s modus operandi. 

 

He spent time on the toilet, he shaved, and he showered. He wandered into the kitchen and manipulated his Keurig. Soon, a steamy mug of Cinnamon Dolce coffee, sweetened with pumpkin spice creamer, was his for the sipping. He carried it to the kitchen island, where Elaina awaited, drinking a similar beverage, otherwise occupied with inactivity.

 

Seating himself, sparing a moment to scratch Maggie’s head as she gamboled about his legs, he asked his wife, “So, what shall we have for breakfast? Or is it brunch time already? Eggs and toast? Bacon and waffles? Pancakes? We could go out, if you’re interested.”

 

“Oh, I don’t know,” she replied, playfully. “We both could stand to lose a few pounds. Perhaps we should skip it.”

 

“And wait until lunch or, God forbid, dinner to dine? Come back to your senses, woman. We’re not as young as we once were. We could starve to death.” He glugged down some coffee and sighed with perfect satisfaction. 

 

“Youth is a state of mind, Carter. We need to stop behaving like fogies. In fact, I’ll tell you what. I’ll fix us some breakfast, whatever you want, but only if we can go ice-skating afterwards. There’s that rink in Carlsbad. What’s it called again? Icetown?”

 

“Ice skating? Either you’re kidding or you’re some deranged doppelganger of the woman I married. I went ice-skating exactly once in my life, when I was nine, on my birthday. I slipped and smacked my head so hard I saw stars. Never again.”

 

“Oh, don’t be such a spoilsport. We’ll buy you a helmet on the way, even kneepads, if you’re so frightened.”

 

“Hey, I never said I was frightened. The word you’re looking for is ‘pragmatic.’”

 

“More like ‘prigmatic.’ Come on, it’ll be fun. If you hurt your poor little noggin, I’ll drive you to the doctor’s office. I’ll even buy you a lollypop, in fact an entire case of them, for being my brave little boy.” 

 

“Lollypop? How about anal?”

 

“You want me to peg you? Did you buy a strap-on without telling me?”

 

“That’s not what I meant. You know the kind of man you married. I’m not some…”

 

“Good-time Charlie?”

 

“Exactly. Not that I’m opposed to every type of fun, mind you.”

 

“Just any and all activities that might land you an owie?” She sniggered.

 

“Yeah, laugh it up, sugarplum. So…weren’t we talking about food? I’m growing hungrier by the moment.”

 

“Well, I could go for some eggs over easy, I guess. Maybe a little bacon.”

 

Unfortunately, Carter and Elaina’s dining was delayed by four rapid, no-nonsense thumps. Instantly alert, Maggie bounded to the front door, barking. 

 

“Are you expecting someone?” Carter asked his wife, eyebrow raised.

 

She shook her head negative.

 

Affecting a cowboy drawl, he said, “Well, I guess I better learn exactly who’s come a-knockin’.”

 

“Go get ’em, partnah.”

 

Carter ambled to the door, scooping Maggie from the floor with one arm as its opposite turned back the deadbolt. “Shh, shh,” he murmured to the corgi. “Behave, or I’ll lock you in the backyard.”

 

Opening the door, he nearly leapt out of his own flesh, nearly lost his grip on his wriggling canine. Four mirrored lenses, perhaps a foot above his eye level, reflected his agitation. Framing the aviator glasses were close-cropped, dark hairstyles and clean-shaven, square jaws. 

 

If not for their dissimilar complexions—cream and mocha, to be exact—the visitors might’ve been brothers. Each wore a dark suit, a white shirt, and a necktie. So polished were their outfits that every integrant that might catch the sunlight—their lapel pins, their tie clips, their cufflinks, even the toes of their wingtip shoes—shone most splendidly. 

 

“Mr. Carter Stanton?” said the Caucasian.

 

“I am he. And who, might I ask—”

 

“I’m Special Agent Charles Sharpe. This is Special Agent Norton Stevens.” Badges and IDs materialized, then vanished, before Carter could properly register them. “Might we come in and chat? We’ve some questions to ask, and today sure is a hot one.”

 

Carter’s stomach dropped. FBI agents at his house carried dark connotations in their pockets, he assumed. “Uh, I guess…I mean, sure, follow me,” he said.

 

Stepping over the threshold, both agents pocketed their sunglasses. Carter decided to lead them into the kitchen, where most of his mugful of coffee yet awaited. He’d need it to irrigate his suddenly far-too-dry mouth.

 

Though Carter couldn’t recall anything he’d done in years that was even slightly illegal, he was nervous all the same. “So, can I get you fellas something to drink?” he asked, keeping his tone even, unruffled. Rounding the dining room, he was pleased to find it spotless. Into the kitchen he strode.

 

The agents started to answer but were interrupted by an “Eep!” Carter had forgotten about Elaina. Though he’d dressed in jeans and an old shirt post-shower, she remained in the nightgown and panties she’d slept in. 

 

“Damn you, Carter!” she shouted, fleeing from the kitchen, toward their bedroom, a study in unbounded jiggling. The agents, to their credit, averted their eyes. 

 

“Sorry about that,” said Carter. “We slept in this morning…are still waking up, in fact.” He set Maggie on the floor. She sniffed the visitors’ ankles, and then scampered off. “Anyway, like I was asking a moment ago, are you thirsty? We have coffee, juice and soda…or something harder, if you’re of a certain disposition.” 

 

“We’re alright,” said Special Agent Stevens with weighted enunciation, swiping his hand through the air as if batting away the question. His partner didn’t seem to mind being spoken for.

 

They seated themselves around the kitchen island, with Carter reclaiming the chair he’d vacated, facing his rapidly cooling coffee, and the agents settling themselves opposite him, all the better to study his face. Sharpe’s eyes were blue; Stevens’ were hazel. Both pairs stared with an intensity that bored into Carter’s psyche. 

 

After gulping down a mouthful of coffee to fortify himself, Carter found words surging up from his throat: “So, I didn’t actually have to let you in, right? You don’t have a warrant, do you? If I don’t like your questions, I don’t have to answer them? I mean…I can call an attorney first, can’t I?” *Now I surely sound guilty*, he thought, as perspiration seeped from his face and his heartbeat accelerated. *They’ll arrest me for some serial killing I’ve never heard of, and that’ll be the end of it. The end of me.*

 

“Sure, you can go that route,” Sharpe answered. “Clam up and call a lawyer, if it makes you feel better. Tell us to leave and we’ll do exactly that. The thing is, though, Mr. Stanton, we’re not accusing *you* of anything. Like I said, we just have some questions, and then we’ll be on our way.”

 

“Oh, well, I guess that’s all right.” 

 

“Great to hear,” said Stevens, all friendly baritone. “At any rate, I’m sure that you’ve already figured out the reason for our visit.”

 

Surprised, nearly spitting out coffee before remembering to swallow it, Carter said, “Not a clue.”

 

“It’s about your ex-wife,” said Sharpe.

 

“Martha? My God, what happened? Did she finally wake up?”

 

“You mean…nobody called you?”

 

“Called me? No, I haven’t been contacted by anyone from Milford Asylum in a while. I was just there, though…half a year ago, give or take.”

 

“A definite oversight,” said Stevens. “You’re listed as her emergency contact. Somebody definitely should’ve been in touch by now.”

 

“Listen,” said Carter. “I have no idea what you’re talking about. Would one of you please explain what the hell is going on here, before my skull detonates?”

 

Ignoring his query, Sharpe asked another of his own: “So, Martha hasn’t called you, or showed up at your door?”

 

“Listen, man, the last time that I saw her, she was completely catatonic. She hasn’t walked, talked, or fed herself in years. I really have no clue what you’re getting at.”

 

“You haven’t been watching the news?” said Stevens, raising a skeptical eyebrow. “You don’t read the paper? It’s kind of a big story.”

 

“Hey, seriously, I’ve been busy. And who wants to follow the news, anyway? It’s nothing but political insanity and PC propaganda these days. Now please, for the last time, explain yourselves. The suspense is killing me.” 

 

The agents met each other’s eyes for a dilated moment, as if debating who’d be the bad news deliverer. Finally, Stevens cleared his throat, so as to say, “Well, Mr. Carter…sorry, it’s been a long day already; I meant to say Mr. Stanton. At any rate, the reason we paid you a visit is because every single person in Milford Asylum—patients, staff and visitors—was found dead, aside from Martha Drexel, your ex-wife. She disappeared from the premises, and hasn’t been seen or heard from since. There was some kind of bloodlust insanity. Everyone slaughtered each other. Corpses were piled in the dayroom.” He paused to let the info sink in. 

 

Carter’s head reeled. The kitchen’s far angles seemed to draw closer. Had he awakened from one nightmare into a worse one? It was as if hours bled out before he again summoned speech. “My God,” he said. “So, Martha was abducted?”

 

“We’re still attempting to determine that,” said Sharpe.

 

“Attempting? I’m pretty sure that the place has security cameras. I mean, doesn’t it? I remember seeing ’em there.”

 

“Correct, Mr. Stanton. There are, in fact, surveillance cameras monitoring the hallways, nurses station, and common rooms at all times…everywhere but the patients’ rooms. It’s the damnedest thing, though. Somehow, some way, for roughly forty-eight hours—a time frame that encapsulated the atrocity—those cameras recorded only green fog of indeterminable origin.”

 

“Fog? Inside the building?”

 

“We know how that sounds,” said Stevens. “But it’s entirely true, sir. At three in the morning, they all hazed over, all at once. By the time whatever was affecting them cleared up, everyone but your ex-wife was dead.”

 

“Are you sure about that?”

 

“Sure about what?” both agents asked in unison. 

 

“That Martha’s still alive. Maybe someone just stashed her corpse somewhere.”

 

“Could be,” said Stevens, absentmindedly massaging his temple, “but until we find a body, we’ll proceed as if she’s still living. Right now, we have nothing else to go on.”

 

Sharpe broke in with, “We were hoping that you’ve seen or heard from Martha. It’s too bad that you haven’t. Still, perhaps you can provide us with info of some use. Out of everyone we might talk to, you knew her the best, surely.”

 

“Her years-ago sane self, sure. But if she’s really awake now, who knows what she’s like? In the delivery room, all those years ago, she became something feral, something unrecognizable, rasping out, ‘You killed my baby,’ even as she herself strangled Douglas, our newborn son. Afterward, she retreated so deep into her own head that she never returned to me, never spoke a word or moved so much as a finger in acknowledgment of anything. If she did finally come back to herself, after all this time, is she the loving, beautiful lady I married or the madwoman, the child-killing lunatic who hardly seemed to exist on the same Earth as the rest of us?”

 

“Good point,” said Sharpe. “Still, people attempting to reconnect with society often visit old haunts. Are there any places you can think of that held special significance to Martha? Good memories or bad, just as long as they’re meaningful.”

 

“Well, there’s our old house, of course, on Calle Tranquila.”

 

“We checked it out,” said Stevens. “The family that lives there now hasn’t seen her.”

 

“Huh. In that case, how about the hospital? Oceanside Memorial Medical Center. That place has been abandoned for years, ever since the ghost incident. Nobody will buy the site. It would make a perfect hidey-hole, if Martha’s not too superstitious.”

 

Impatiently, Sharpe waved his hand. “We toured it already. Spooky, sure, but no signs of life. The security patrol we spoke with said that even skateboarders avoid the place. Imagine that.”

 

“Okay, well, we used to frequent the beach in the summertime…sometimes the pier, sometimes the harbor. Before Martha became pregnant with Douglas, when we still socialized with friends, we’d occasionally go to Brengle Terrace Park for barbecues. That’s in—”

 

“Vista, we know,” said Stevens, interrupting. “Was Martha particularly close to any of these friends of yours? Or were there any memorable fights?”

 

“No, not really. She kept all social interactions limited to boring small talk. A shy one, my Martha, definitely not into fighting. In fact, I don’t recall her ever raising her voice in anger to anyone. Even when we argued, she retained her composure.” He shook his head and muttered, “I don’t know what happened to her.”

 

“What about family? Any in the area? Was Martha close with her parents and siblings? Her cousins, perhaps?”

 

“No, Martha’s dad died years ago, and the rest of her family are East Coasters. They hardly kept in touch, save for a phone call or email every now and then. After Martha’s breakdown, they severed all ties with me. They never even met our son Douglas.”

 

“I see,” said Sharpe. He stood and sighed, as did his partner, seconds later. “Well, we appreciate you answering our questions, Mr. Stanton, though I can’t say we gained much from this conversation…unless Martha decides to show up at the beach or park sometime soon. Still, I’ll leave you with my number. If she pays you a visit or contacts you in any way, please don’t hesitate to call me.” From his wallet came a business card, upon which the golden FBI shield was printed alongside Sharpe’s phone number and email address. 

 

Carter shook their hands and accompanied the pair to the door. Watching the agents climb into a blue sedan and drive off, he was surprised to find himself shivering. *Martha, what has become of you?* he wondered. *Did you kill a bunch of people and flee the scene, or are you the victim this time? Are you even alive, or just a decoration in some serial killer’s living room?*

 

He closed the door. Swiveling on his heels, he nearly shrieked to find Elaina standing before him, now fully dressed. She’d donned a floral print dress, brushed her hair, and applied just enough makeup to give her a natural look. “Those serious-looking guys in the suits,” she demanded, “who were they?” 

 

“A couple of FBI agents,” he answered. 

 

Elaina’s eyes went wide. “What did they want? You’re not a secret serial murderer, are you? Or some kind of kiddie porn connoisseur?”

 

“Come on now, honey. I rarely leave the house without you…and you’re peeking over my shoulder half the time I’m online. I don’t have enough privacy for such activities.” 

 

“Otherwise you’d partake?”

 

“Of course not.” He took a deep breath and began to recount his conversation with the agents.

1pf2npv,https://i.redd.it/rwkekihuhf5g1.jpeg,"Looking for this novel from Novasread. It may be under a different name ""Sixteen, pregnant, and my boyfriend dumped me before moving across the country""","Looking for this novel!

Seventeen, I met King. He swore that at seventeen, I was it for him. But I didn't think he would break me into a million tiny pieces a week later.
Now eight years later, I met Kim again. ""I found out I was pregnant two months after you left. When I was six months pregnant, I found out that it was actually twins. "" I pause to let that information sink in, while two of the Bluff brothers hang their heads. But not King; King is maintaining eye contact with me. ""I lived in my car, thanks for that by the way, until the babies were born. Then we lived in a women's shelter, until I was jumped for their formula. Then we were back to living in the car. The backseat isn't very roomy, but I made it work.""
""You lived in your car with two babies?"" This question comes from King's dad. ""Yes.We lived in the car for six months until I got into low-income housing. Even then I didn't sleep, my neighbor was a dope dealer, and people were coming in and out, the walls were paper thin.""
King quietly stands up and walks outside, slamming the door behind him. Looking at King's brothers, the ones I considered my brothers, but now they are strangers, their faces have lost all color due to the details of the last eight years.

Pregnant.
Just call me a cliché. Sixteen, pregnant, and my boyfriend dumped me before moving across the country. Let's not forget the cherry on top of this shiit sundae: I live in a falling apart trailer with my dope addict mother and her deadbeat boyfriend.
Screw. My. Life.
I thought I had a plan to get out of Magnolia Park the dump I've called home for the last six years. It was a good plan, or so I thought. I put all my trust in a boy, but he had no problems ripping my heart out and stomping on it for good measure. The trajectory of my life thus far should have been a sign that I would not drive off into the sunset with Kingston Bluff. King was the Robin Hood of the trailer park. Seventeen, not afraid of breaking the law if it helped one of the kids that lived here. He always found a way to bring food home, never leaving anyone behind. The unwritten rule was to meet at the picnic bench behind the trailer park at seven each night for dinner. We were a group of kids with parents who seemed to have missed the memo about responsibility, so we looked out for one another.

King spun a tale of him and along with his brothers, leaving the state of Georgia, and never coming back. He swore that at seventeen, I was it for him. And me, knowing nothing about love, believed him. King and his brothers were my family; my mom hasn't paid attention to me in years. Not since my dad left and she started hanging around different men every other week, and those men had a taste for hard dopes. Ever since then, I've been an afterthought. Now, I have to figure out how Im going to finish school, have a baby, and support a baby. I don't know what I'm doing, and I'm scared shitless. I can't even say that I shouldn't be pregnant, I knew the risk, but I didn't think my person would break me into a million tiny pieces a week later. However, I will always remember an important lesson.
All men are capable of is breaking your heart. ""Guys! We gotta go, we're going to be late for school,"" I yell down the hallway before grabbing my keys and purse. My kids are not morning people and this is a fight we have weekly. Thank God school is out next week. Neither one of them are crazy about school, so I look forward to the few months off.
That's right. My surprise eight years ago turned out to be twins.

Fun times.
Lochlyn enters the small kitchen and grabs her bookbag from the island. We both have raven colored hair and dark blue eyes. Loch still looks like she is half asleep when I step up to her and quickly braid her hair into two pigtails. I'm about to yell over my shoulder again, when my son Teller, slowly walks into the kitchen. His dad's genes said copy and paste when it comes to Telle. Dark brown hair, ice blue eyes, dimples in both cheeks. Imagine my surprise when my son asked me to give him a buzz cut, one that matched how King always wore his hair. Too bad they will probably never know each other.
""Are you working from home today, Mom?"" Teller asks me as he grabs two waters out of the fridge, handing his sister one. My son is a born protector, and unfortunately, I haven't eased that burden for my son. Trouble seems to always be one step behind me, and their earlier years were tense, to put it lightly. ""Im going to go sit at Dell's to send some emails but then be back here working on my next cover."" I'm a book cover designer for independently published authors, and I couldn't imagine a better career. I still pick up shifts at a local restaurant, because raising two kids isn't cheap, and my son somehow seems to need a bigger size every month. Not for the first time, I wish that I had someone to carry the load. But I tried that, and I won't be going down that road anytime soon. Never again, preferably. ""Alright, monkeys, we've gotta go."" The kids groan but follow me outside. I try to hide my smile when Telle grabs Loch's bag, knowing she has it weighed down with her sketchbooks. I like to think that my daughter got her artistic abilities from me, which could be true, but it's also likely that she got it from an uncle she never met. I think of the Bluff brothers often, usually when Loch shows me a drawing she is proud of, or when Telle looks at me with a wide smile on his face.
I think of the boy I loved with every damaged part of my heart. I wonder where he's at, if he's married with a family. I wonder if he thinks of the poor girl he left behind all those years ago. I get the kids to school and watch them enter the building before I take off towards the coffee shop. I used to walk them into school myself every day, but I heard the other kids snickering. I don't want Loch and Telle to be made fun of. They already live in a single parent household, in an embarrassing apartment building, where they never invite friends over. The deck has always been stacked against them. I feel guilty going to work at the coffee shop today. Life in general is expensive, add in doing the single parent thing, and there is no extra money. I rarely treat myself, but an author reached out last night to secure three book covers. Id say that calls for a sweet treat. I was so scared to put myself out there, but my best friend, Skye, saW some of my mock covers and made a social media account and website for me, and before I knew it, I had people messaging me for services. Because of my inability to tell anyone no, I trade sleep for late night design sessions.
As soon as I found out about my pregnancy, I told myself that I would never be like my mom. I cook dinner every night, we sit down and do homework together, we have family game nights. I go without, so my kids don't have to. They'll never know that for the frst few years of their lives, I barely ate so I could afford to feed them. After paying for my muffin and latte, I find a small table in the corner. Pulling out my used iPad, I connect to the Wi-Fi and start going through my email.  My phone lights up on the table, a smile breaking out on my face when I see who it is.
Jelly
I miss your face.
I met Skye when the twins were three, and we were both working at a coffee shop. The kids and I were living in a four hundred square foot shithole, that I'm pretty sure had a mold problem. Skye andI connected easily and shortly after, we got a three-bedroom apartment and became roommates. She moved to Michigan with the love of her life earlier this year, and if I didn't like him so much, I would hate him. She is the sister I always wanted. I'm the Peanut Butter to her Jelly. I desperately miss my person. I miss your face, too!
Jelly
You, my niece, and my nephew could come here for the summer.
Skye has been trying to get me up to Michigan since she moved earlier this year. As much as I would love to, I just don't know. Telle wanted to play soccer this year, Loch wanted to join an art class. I pick up a couple of nights a month at the restaurant. I just don't know how going ten plus hours away is feasible. You know I would love to; I just don't know if I can do it.
Jelly
I know. I thought I would try. I miss the days of Skye and I splitting a bottle of cheap wine after the twins went to bed, or when she tagged herself in when Loch had a fever, and Telle wouldn't stop crying because his sister was sick. Skye got home to find me in tears because I couldn't make either of my kids feel better. There is no worse feeling than not being able to help your kids. Skye came into my life when I really needed someone. Someone that didn't judge that I was a teen mom, that I was barely making it. She saw through the bullshit. Finishing up my work, I order two cookies for the kids to have after school. Loch, my sweets addict, would take one sniff, and know that I got something without her. Pulling up to our apartment building, I cringe when I take the building in. There is garbage stuck in the dead landscaping, the sidewalk is littered with cracks, and one side of the building is decorated in graffiti.
I'd never say this out loud, but the artist is actually really good.
When Skye moved, I moved into a two-bedroom apartment, on the bad side of town. I didn't inform my friend that I would be doing this. Skye would have dug her heels in and wouldn't have moved. And she deserves her happily ever after. She hasn't lived a charmed life either. Slowing down before I reach my apartment, my heart feels like it's about to burst out of my chest. My hands shake as I pick up the teddy bear that I find sitting on my welcome mat. Rushing into the apartment, locking the door behind me, I numbly walk into the kitchen. Looking over the bear, I find a note that was secured on the inside of the T-shirt.
You thought you could run from me.

1pf2mcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1pf2mcd/he_is_never_initiating_change_something_on_you/,"He is never initiating, „Change something on you“","As the title says, I am the reason why he is never initiating sex with me. 
This is what he said today to me. 



So I (34f) am typing this with intention to share with my husband (m34) too. Because he thinks i am not writing neutral.
I have been reading a lot on this page and wondering if what we have with him is a deadbedroom. 
He has been lately zero interest in me, especially after knowing I am pregnant. The week I got pregnant we were extremely happy on sex, on vacation at home, my app calendar was full of hearts. 

At first it stopped completely he going down on me, I wondered and curiously asked what is the reason. He then explained, after giving up since three months on that and not even telling me anything not to break my heart or to make sure no trouble comes out, „one time or two it smelled bad.“ I appreciated he said it. I hated it I would hate it. Omg i took care and had shower everyday, ordered intimgel, used shower oil that there is no smell at least two times a day. 

He did not try though since two weeks any sexual touch to me except from jokingly hitting my butt, or kissing me, hugging me under the blanket. 

Yesterday I had an emotional breakdown after reading all here. 
1. i am worried if this is like this how it will be after baby is born. 
2. i am the woman and seeing all the time woman complaining their husband wanting too much sex(normal ratio too) and they are done rejecting their husband melted me down. 
3. Mine not showing any attraction towards me sexually.

He came from work yesterday I was just out from shower. He hugged me kissed me meaningfully. I thought maybe we will not make „no sex in a month“ but at the end after so much huggings and kissings nothing happened. 

I got an attack like stress in bed and just said him I cant sleep I will go to sofa. I cried could not hold myself. Tried to hide it but our walls are so thin. 
He just snored and slept. 

Next day, he did not even ask what happened to you yesterday. 
Whole day nothing… 

Today during lunchtime I asked him why he is cold he said why i am aggressive. 
(He never talks directly never is his style to talk directly communication)
He put that on me. 
Then I said nothing but afterwork,“are you not even worried why I cried yesterday night and left the bed“
He said I simply dont care. 

Key point after i asked but a normal people cares what could be the reason one leaving bed crying. 

He said „ why should this be interesting for me, it is again something new, which needs to be opened again, as if last weeks we did not have enough problems.“ (assuming without knowing it is about him and not even want to know). 

Then i said why do you care about if i drink coffee but not this. His answer was „because it is a fucking BULLSHIT, which is not resolved, will not be resolved. Just another thing which is besides 2000 things you don’t like about me and fuck me up every other day“ 

He said I need to change something. 
He does not care what I feel. 
If he goes to therapy he will go for himself and I should not expect anything from it. 


Because of bringing this topic I was labeled narcissist, bcs I dont care about his feelings. 
He came from work hugging me kissing me, I am the problem thinking he might have interest in me. 
He said of just feels strange afterwards he does not want to initiate sex with me. 
I feel so left out, so burned out, so used. 

I read the part what people have here as option in deadbedrooms, either divorce, open relationship, therapy or live like this forever. 

Sexlessness something. But not being desired after months again… He can kiss me make jokes, share his day with me, make stuff together but then give me as a reason I have been the reason he lost interest in me because of our fights since 5-6 years in our times together. 



I assume these are my things which turns him down. 
- not initiation or showing interest sexually.
- not organizing any events for us, no surprises , not even doing something special on birthdays or year anniversaries. 
- using any free time (before the baby comes) for his hobbies and games- instead of saying come this is our alone time lets do some nice thing together. 
- we are contributing almost equal to the living expenses.
- catching him doing things behind me, has happened months ago, I am sure it is still same. Doing porn and rejecting me when I initiated sex. Telling he has erectile dysfunction. 
- i have been talking to him everyweek yes that he should throw his trash to trash not on the floor leaving. Or his clothes to be go to laundry not rest on the floor two weeks unless I say something. 
- simply said having the mental load at home and paperwork from governmental things. 

He is done with my REQUESTS. He does not feel enough or he feels burned out from my wishes. He cannot stand to any criticism coming from me.

There are plenty of reasons to count oneself as a morning person: the serenity of a sunrise, the awe-inspiring glitter of the morning dew, the convenience of getting an early start to the day… But for our money, one reason stands head and shoulders above all others: Breakfast sandwiches. Perfected over decades of practice by burger joints and coffee shops the world over, the breakfast sandwich is the ultimate incentive for morning person-hood, and Trader Joe’s English Muffin Breakfast Sandwich may just be the epitome of its expression.

Each package comes with two Sandwiches made with tender, crisp-exterior, fluffy-interior English Muffins, layered with a hearty pork sausage patty, scrambled eggs, and melty Cheddar cheese. Once quickly and conveniently prepped in the microwave or air fryer, every bite is savory and full-flavored, with each Sandwich containing 18 grams of protein to set up the rest of your day for success. And here’s the best part: you don’t actually have to be a morning person to eat them, nor need they be strictly served at Breakfast! For a savory Sandwich that can be enjoyed anytime (and happens to be especially delicious in the morning), check out the freezer at your neighborhood Trader Joe’s.

I started my calendar a little late because I don't usually brew such small doses and wanted to get dialed in before starting. I'm usually making pourover for myself and my roommates every morning (20-40 grams cycling between a couple of origamis and V60 ceramic, + Perfect Coffee Water). I have these very dialed in. 

For the 14g doses I landed on using the deep 27 with a Millab M01 (still relatively new but seasoned enough, set to 7.5). Days 1 and 2 were good but not great. Days 3 and 4 smell amazing and I'm hoping to improve them. Hoping to hear what y'all do so I can learn more 🫶☕️",1,1764958824.0,TanatAdventCalendar25,3,1.0,False

1pf2hqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1pf2hqw/ideal_water_volume_in_aeropress/,Ideal Water Volume in AeroPress,"I see most AeroPress recipes tell you to use a particular volume of water (fill with x grams, or fill to this # on chamber) but then most of us add water to the finished plunge to whatever strength we want. Why not fill the chamber almost to the top, brew for whatever time you want and then plunge as usual? 

My rationale is: the more water available for the coffee to disperse into, the more extraction achieved per gram of ground coffee. If you use a limited volume of water the extraction process is slowed as time goes on, leaving some ingredients still sitting in the grounds. I typically fill to #4 or a little higher before inserting the seal to let it brew for 2 minutes. I also presoak the grounds for 30 seconds to release CO2. 

This also begs the question of why a relatively coarse grind and long brew time vs. fine grind and immediate plunge like Alan Adler recommended? I accidentally recently ground my morning coffee to about an Espresso grind and plunged immediately; it turned out pretty good.",3,1764958811.0,AeroPress,9,0.81,False

My husband and I are two gay dads living in Canada with our two daughters (ages 6 and 4). We’re planning to move to Paris for a year, most likely within the next 1–2 years, and we’d love to start connecting with other gay dads or LGBTQ families who currently live there.

We’re not looking for travel tips, more hoping to build community, hear about your experiences raising kids in Paris, and maybe even grab a coffee or a playground meetup once we arrive.

I speak French and we’re open to connecting with both expat families and local Parisian families.

If you’re a gay dad in Paris (or know someone who is), I’d love to hear from you.  Any advice, connections, school thoughts, neighbourhood tips, or just a “bonjour” would be amazing!

1pf2gau,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1pf2gau/ldr_communication_shift_seeking_relatable/,LDR Communication Shift : Seeking relatable Perspectives on Attachment and Distance (34M/28F),"# Hey Reddit, I need some perspective, especially from guys who have navigated the anxiety and communication shifts that come with starting a Long-Distance Relationship (LDR).

My girlfriend (28F) and I (34M) have been dating for about six months. We were extremely close, practically living together. A week ago, she moved to a rural town for a new NGO job.

Since she left, the relationship has done a 180, and it’s sending my anxiety through the roof. **1. Sudden Communication Drop:** When she was here, she was hyper-communicative—calling me constantly throughout the day, Face Timing from her desk, sharing every tiny detail. Now, replies are hours late, spontaneous calls have stopped, and our daily interaction is minimal.

**2.The Trigger Event:** A few days ago, she missed my calls and texts for hours (later saying she was out for coffee/dinner). When I expressed my worry—not anger, but genuine concern about the sudden lack of contact—she became extremely defensive. Instead of acknowledging the change, she flat-out **refused to admit anything was different** and essentially blamed me for ""not understanding"" the adjustment period required for her new location.

**The Emotional Aftermath:** Our recent conversations feel forced and awkward. The natural flow is gone. I realize I have a deep-seated **fear of abandonment** that this situation has violently unearthed. I find myself constantly checking my phone, getting upset over small delays, and feeling like the relationship is becoming a burden to her.

I know people get busy, and I know she needs time to adjust, but what hurts is **the lack of validation.** She acts as if everything is perfectly fine, while to me, the entire foundation of our connection feels shaky and distant. I love her deeply, but I'm terrified that my insecurity and need for constant reassurance will ruin this LDR before it even gets started.

To the men (and anyone else) who have been through this exact scenario:

1. **Attachment Healing:** If you realized the communication shift was mostly triggering your own **anxious attachment issues** (fear of abandonment/being forgotten), how did you handle the internal anxiety? What strategies did you use to **self-soothe** and stop relying on her texts for validation?
2. **Managing the Shift:** How did you successfully **reset your expectations** and transition from a hyper-communicative relationship to one with reliable, low-frequency contact without seeming needy or causing conflict?
3. **Was it Normal?:** Did the relationship survive the initial, painful communication shift? If so, what was the turning point?

I need to learn to accept this new reality and become a secure partner. Any advice on how to practically **stop obsessing over her availability** and make the LDR sustainable would be deeply appreciated. Thank you.",2,1764958717.0,LongDistance,0,1.0,False

but like.. ugh he just gotta go. i really just am not a fan. shane and rylands dynamic is perfect by itself! add in morgan...( although when i think of them, i kinda do just imagine them from 2019 😭😭) and thats a pretty good video right there. even if it is just them trying trader joes snacks... 

  
maybe its just the content. i mean them just trying coffee in a car isnt gonna be good anyways, but spencer just does not match the vibe!!
