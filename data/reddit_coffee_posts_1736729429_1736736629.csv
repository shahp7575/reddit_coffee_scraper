We agreed to wake up early most days to be able to enjoy the the trip. However, in his typical fashion he didn't stick to this agreement. For nearly two months I was upset with this. And each time I said anything he said that I was berating him, or he ignored me. Yet, he complained whenever we would be out late in the day. Something which was a result of not getting up earlier and leaving late most days. He took this out on me and and failed to aknowledge this. Now for the past few days he is trying to get up earlier and we have planned to get back earlier. But both days we have been held up, in large part by my mother frequently stopping for bathroom and smoke breaks. He aknowledges it's her primarily making us take longer but still takes it out on me. He also agrees to go places and do things, only to complain later on. 

Today all three of us left around 11:30am with the hopes of getting back around 5pm. We wanted to come back to sell things which we need to do. We went to get coffee and that took longer than it should. My mother goes elsewhere to get her coffee and takes a smoke break each time. We sat for a while after as we usually do, mainly because we are waiting on my mother or deciding where to go. It was past 12pm when I put in a destination. A shopping center that is 20mins away. I went into five stores all next to each other for no more than 5mins each. My mother took longer than I did. It was 1pm maybe a bit later when we left. We talked a little bit about something I was wanting to buy for both of us and that took some time. I then went to a Walmart which I was no more than 5 mins in. I went in to check for something that they didn't have. My mother stayed in longer than I did and we had to wait on her. We then went to target which was 10 mins away. I took the longest in there roughly 15mins. After that we went 20mins away to another shopping center. I took 5mins in the store there. 

When I came out we talked a bit about what to get to eat. It was nearing 3:30pm at that point. He said he wanted a particular place. The closest locations were both 30mins away. I had a few places left I wanted to go to being a tjmaxx, marshalls, and a fry's marketplace. I said if we went to one of the two places we could get everything done rather quickly, that they were all near one another. He chose where we went because it was 20mins opposed to 40mins back to the house. When we got there it was 4pm. We ate for 30mins and then went to the tjmaxx which was 7mins away. When we got there he was asking me if that was the last place and seemed annoyed. I said no and that I was going to Marshalls and fry's. He said he forgot about those and could I leave Marshalls. That it was almost 5pm. I said I would leave Marshalls. I noticed there was a Walmart 5mins away and I asked if I could quickly stop there before going to fry's. I wanted to run in and check for what I'm searching for. He agreed to going there. 

On the way to Walmart he asked me if I would get groceries there instead of going to fry's. I said I would see if that had what I was getting. He kept asking me wanting me to just say yes. We went in and I looked for the item I'm after. They didn't have it and they were very busy. My anxiety was being triggered. I knew that even if my stuff was there it would take me quite some time to do a shop. I said that we should leave and go to fry's. We had only been in there a few minutes. He told me to at least go and look at the groceries, that my mother was already over there. I went and found a few items but none of the rest. I said I still needed to go to fry's. He was frustrated and asked me why I got the few things then, why I didn't just leave. I said I tried to and he told me to take a look. That I couldn't have left anyways as my mother was shopping. He told me I went back on my agreement. I said that it was him who did that because he knew I was going to fry's. That I told him I likely wouldn't be able to do a shop in Walmart. That I was right and it wasted time. 

We left the store and he started arguing with me about getting back later than planned. It was 5:40pm. I said that I wasn't the one holding us up. That I had been quick all day. He aknowledged it was my mother but kept taking it out on me. He then started complaining about driving too much and going too many places. When he agreed to going to all of them, and hadn't said anything until after it was past 5pm. I asked why agree to go to the place that was 30mins away then. Why take 30mins to eat. Why expect me to just up and leave the last few things I was doing as it seemed like he was. He said I wasn't listening, that I wasn't understanding.  When he didn't seem to be listening to me whatsoever instead chewing my head off for having driven so much, and about getting back past 5pm. 

This is how it's always been. He agrees to do things, goes along with them in the moment, and then gets angry and takes it out on me. I'm not even sure it it was where we went or how many places we went to, if it wasn't just the getting back past 5pm. For all the mornings he woke up late, and left late, compared to the few days we intended to get back earlier and didn't. He is taking it out on me far more than I did him. Why agree in the first place? Is it enjoyable for him to agree and act okay with it and then go off at me after the fact? I don't get it. He won't aknowledge that I did try to quickly get things done, that I was paying attention to the time, that I left going to Marshalls, and that I did attempt to do my grocery shop at Walmart. 

He is saying now that he isn't going out to get dinner as we planned. That he's not going anywhere tomorrow. That he's not going on a planned trip we were going on in a few days. That I should get somewhere else to drive me, that no one else would. Or that I should learn to drive myself. He says I don't understand because I don't drive. He thinks he's right because he's driven a lot, something which I aknowledge he's done, but that he is agreeing to each time. It's because I won't take the blame and accept this from him that he won't stop. ",1,1736736536.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

And lastnight I slept really bad, I couldn’t fall asleep until 5AM, due to a racing mind and hunger. I slept until about 10:00 AM but had woken up every hour.

When I woke up, I had a headache and low energy. I figured breakfast and milk/coffee would help. But after I ate, I got worse. A few hours later, I was eventually unable to even move. I was shaking slightly, slightly dizzy, slight tunnel vision, slight nausea, and a bad headache (I never get headaches). It got to the point where I couldn’t even move and it felt like a really bad hangover but I don’t drink. I couldn’t go to sleep due to the coffee/milk I just had. 

It got so bad, I almost went to the hospital because I was worried I was gonna die. But I don’t have health insurance currently, so I’d rather die than go to the hospital and have them take me for all I’m worth.

This lasted a couple of hours until I finally decided maybe I had low blood sugar, I ate a chocolate and basically instantly felt better. 

I am slightly skinny but muscular. I’ve been trying to eat a lot and put on weight, but haven’t had much luck. 3 meals a day is too much to keep up with. I usually eat 1 big meal a day, with other calories/snacking throughout the day. I haven’t been counting calories, but I typically feel like I’m eating enough. 

I eat mostly real food, such as red meat, eggs, rice, bananas, avocados, and avoid processed foods like the plague.

Was this a low blood sugar episode? Or just sugar withdrawal? Or am I possibly nutrient deficient somehow? Am I not eating enough despite my efforts? Is sugar necessary if I’m eating other carbs?",1,1736736448.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Prologue: 1908-1953

-Born to middle class and went to Lachaven business school 

“His father would come home and terrorize his mother and him. I think talking his way out of his fathers wrath is where his silver tongue came from. If he didn’t go into politics he would have been a great salesman! He never looked back once he got to Lachaven. He burned every letter from his parents, and I think he only regretted it after his mother died.”

-Interview with Monica Rayne in “Anton Rayne: The Father of Sordish Democracy” 1985

-Protested Luderin’s coup and held his ground 

“When they charged I stood my ground, I was lucky they didn’t kill me. What no one tells you about broken ribs is how much it hurts to speak, probaby the quietest I’ve ever been.”

-A Radical Interveiw with Rayne in 1953

-Joined student council 

“After the protests Anton only grew more opposed to authoritarianism, but he got smarter about it. He stayed away from those street brawlers, he used his charisma and joined the student council to push for greater student participation in the budget.”

-“Alongside a Hero” by Petr Vectern, 1977

-Met Monica, didn’t much care for women’s rights 

“A student rally was where he and Monica met, he liked her diligence in organizing her sororities' support, although he didn’t care much about that ladies' crusade of hers at the time.”

-“Alongside a Hero” by Petr Vectern, 1977

-He voted for Soll

“I can’t believe I used to support the [Redacted], Member of honor, my foot. I’m sure he's the secret puppet master behind Alphonso’s fall. I KNOW IT.”

	-Recorded by a bug in the 1953 Rayne Campaign office placed by Lucian Galade 

-He faithfully served in Bergia and sent the refugees back.

“I could see how you chafed at the hierarchy, and lack of oversight for abuse. But you were a good soldier under my command, you respected me for my fairness. I think that's why you did it”

-Iosef Lancea in response to Rayne recounting escorting refugees back to Wehlen despite moral reservations, Interview with Sordland Today, 1963

-Began working for USP because he wanted to fix the country

“I remember meeting Anton, I was a young clerk in the Central Bank, and Anton was an aide in the Economy ministry. He was endlessly diligent and was a favorite of his superiors as a result. We didn’t speak much, but we got along. Who would have thought of the places we'd go?”

-Interview with Symon Holl in “Anton Rayne: The Father of Sordish Democracy” 1985

-Accepted Solls MP offer gladly, sacrificing family for work

“He went off the deep end when Soll made him an MP. We all know how good of a husband I was, and I was the one who had to tell him to go home to his family.”

	-“Alongside a Hero” by Petr Vectern, 1977 

-Watched from the sidelines, took Solls deal and voted for him

 “I knew he liked Alphonso, but he didn’t want to get caught on the wrong side if things went sideways. He told me about Soll’s deal with him and said it was the insurance policy he thought he needed.”

-“Alongside a Hero” by Petr Vectern, 1977

 -Campaigned for Alphonso

“I was very surprised by the result, but very pleased, from the moment I heard I threw all my energy into making sure Alphonso won. It was probably the biggest election upset in USP history.”

-From “A War of Words”, Rayne’s Autobiography, 1978

-He worked to make Sordland better

“Rayne the Giant Slayer”

-Caption of a political cartoon in a 1947 issue of the Radical depicting Rayne fighting a giant labeled “corruption”

-He advised Alphonso to step down because of the recession 

“I knew when he advised me to go it was all over, if he was telling me to go it meant the rest of the party probably wanted me gone too. He’s careful like that. I’ve never felt more defeated.”

-Ewald Alphonso in an interview with the Lachaven Times, 1953

-he promised to enact democratic reforms, align west, promote free markets, reform education, and relax immigration.

“People of Sordland, the time for reform is not over! Sordland is sick! Let me be its doctor! I promise to democratize our system, I will keep the hands of unelected and self-serving bureaucrats from strangling you! That is not all, I will revitalize our rotten education system, no longer will the darkness of ignorance blind your children to those who cheat them! Furthermore I will bring us closer to Angolia, Lespia and our western brethren to rebuild Sordland’s trade relations. Sordland was once great, and it can be made great again! A MORGNA WES CORE!”

-Rayne at a Narbel campaign rally in 1953

Chapter One: Drastic Economic Action, 1954

-Rayne insisted media should be independent 

“Lucian tried to convince me to control the media, he's not wrong it would make this easier but I want to avoid copying Soll’s path, I won’t be in office forever, and the next man may abuse such power.”

-“Presidential Journal of Anton Rayne: 1954” edited by Deana & Monica Rayne, published 1985

-Vetoed the campaign finance bill

-Cartoon in the Young Sords Monthly Bulletin, 1954

-Invested in the L-1 railway project 

“Those who say President Rayne is betraying the people to business interests simply haven’t looked at the charts. As this graph clearly shows…”

	-Symon Holl in a press conference on the decision, 1954

-Didn’t buy Armandine Stock

“Gus offered an opportunity to buy stock in a radio company today, turned him down. The slimy crook wouldn't be in my here if I didn’t think I needed the bridge between my administration and Alphonso’s”

-“Presidential Journal of Anton Rayne: 1954” edited by Deana & Monica Rayne, published 1985

-Visited protesters in person

“He shook my hand and said to me, “Son, it will all get better I promise, hold tight, stay out of trouble, and steer clear of people selling a quick fix and I promise it will get better.” I was fifteen then, and I’m proud to say I took his advice, without him I probably would of joined the Young Sords and had my head kicked in in some street fight. President Rayne was a real man of the people. I owe my life to him.”

	-Rudolf Sacwin, mourner at Rayne’s State Funeral, 1984

-Didn’t take Tusks bribe

“Good knowing what Lotherberg thinks. Smug as he is he is a valuable asset, good taste in cigars too. But he needs to learn the rules, no bribes. Bribery is abhorrent, let alone the risk. Underhall might be a good choice if only to build trust with Lotherberg.”

-“Presidential Journal of Anton Rayne: 1954” edited by Deana & Monica Rayne, published 1985

-Authorized a business bailout 

“The people have not been forgotten, this was a decision made for the people, what use is one measly stimulus check if your employer goes bankrupt.”

	-Rayne in a radio address, 1954

-Chose Underhall for the L-1 project.

“The Administration is very happy with the work Underhall can do, they have a respectable volume of work. They can allow us to maintain our economic aims while still ensuring the Sordish economy benefits, better than having billions disappear into foreign bank accounts.”

-Gus Manger at a press conference following the decision, 1954

-Didn’t take Koronti’s Deal

“Didn’t trust the look in the bastard's eye, too smug and too threatening, if he’s that blunt while pretending to do me a favor I hate to imagine what happens if I end up owing him? Probably will kill me if I cross him.”

-“Presidential Journal of Anton Rayne: 1954” edited by Deana & Monica Rayne, published 1985

-He attended the Circas funeral, allowed the red youth to stay but put guards on them

“I reasoned that it wasn’t unusual that Red Youth members would be at their leader's funeral, and it was unlikely to be assassins. But I thought I was better safe than sorry and had Mr. Greiser put some guards on them. I was on edge the whole funeral.”

-From “A War of Words”, Rayne’s Autobiography, 1978

-Closed the Rumburg consulate 

“It was a hard decision, but I decided that I need to present a strong front against their aggression in the hopes they would cease it. I was disappointed to find I was wrong.”

-From “A War of Words”, Rayne’s Autobiography, 1978

-Signed the tourism act

“Lounge on the beaches of Benfi, Hike the forests of Laren, Take in the Mountain vistas of Narbel, Sip whisky in Erlory, shop in a Holsord bazaar.”

	-Poster in Lespia as part of the “Seeing Sordland” Tourist campaign, 1954

-Declined Hawkers demand to declare an emergency

“Hawker and Garaci visited today, tried to threaten me and convince me to betray the republic. More proof of the Old Guard Octopus strangling this land. Must keep an eye on them.”

-“Presidential Journal of Anton Rayne: 1954” edited by Deana & Monica Rayne, 1985

-Invested in Gascom alone and negotiated better housing for workers

“He told the public it was a move of “Sordish Protectionism”, and in fairness it was. But it was also because he was suspicious of Rizia, their ties to Rumburg worried him. He mentioned while briefing me about the meeting that he thought it was a Rummish ploy to undermine us. Quite typical of him.”

-“Alongside a Hero” by Petr Vectern, 1977

-Successfully talked down the protest, cheer as he left

“It is to me the quintessential example of his charisma, some have said that it was no great feat. How else would a crowd react if you gave them what they've spent years fighting for? But they weren't there, the rabid strikers and melenyevists turned placid as lambs within minutes, I’d never seen such a fast change in a crowd.”

	-Interview with Gus Manger in “Anton Rayne: The Father of Sordish Democracy” 1985

-Didn’t ban any political groups

“Restricting the right of others to assemble and protest their government will only lead to armed resistance, without an outlet for one's frustrations armed resistance is the only recourse one has. Our country enshrines free speech in law, and we must uphold these fine Nur given rights.”

-Television address by Rayne, 1954

-Vetoed G.R.E.E.N Act

	“The cause is admirable, but a recession is the wrong time to pass this law.”

	-Official memo to the assembly on the veto, 1954

-Proposed a new constitution with the following changes: Vetoes overridden by supermajority, Supreme Court loses vote, impeachment by majority of assembly and supreme court, confidence vote for ministers, 8% election threshold, decrees require enabling act, two term limit, Supreme Court may be impeached.

“Nia spoke at length trying to convince Anton not to remove the judges immunity. He could taste the blood of the old guard and his conquest of them though, so in it went.”

	-“Alongside a Hero” by Petr Vectern, 1977

-Didn’t promise tax cuts to Tusk

“Tusk appears to be learning, no bribe this time. A tad demanding, and gave me a veiled threat when I refused, but he is playing the game. I need to be careful, he may be a threat if I keep going against him.”

-“Presidential Journal of Anton Rayne: 1954” edited by Deana & Monica Rayne, 1985

-Increased foreign EPA investment limit to 49%

“I was very happy with the decision. After the consulate incident and his refusal to partner with Rizia I grew concerned that he would drag Sordland into isolation with an inability to compromise with foreign countries. I spent several nights sleepless with worry. Catherine was very worried I might have another heart attack. But Rayne took the middle ground, it showed he was willing to open ourselves up to other countries.”

-From “A Life of Service”, Deivid Wisci’s Autobiography, 1960

-New Budget: Education, Law & Order, and Military increased, healthcare maintained.

“Still almost twenty five years later I can recall how ill Symon looked when I put forward the budget plan, in one fell swoop I had plunged Sordland into massive debt. I thought he might vomit right there. I spoke to a secretary later that day and she said he had returned from the meeting and then locked himself in his office for half an hour. Looking back I can see just how precarious things were economically, I am very sorry Symon, I shouldn’t have put a friend through that.”

-From “A War of Words”, Rayne’s Autobiography, 1978

Chapter II: Strides are Made, 1955

-Signed the WRA

“For too long you have been ignored, betrayed, and abused! While I say you have suffered long enough! I say no more! I say it's time we have proper protection for the people who make Sordland strong!”

	-Rayne in a speech before Lorren coal miners during a tour of Lorren, 1955

-Invested in Lorren

“I thank you for your dedication to Sordish Recovery. The administration is proud to support patriots such as you. A morgna wes core!”

	-Rayne toasting at a dinner with Morna Factory owners during a tour of Lorren, 1955

-Justice Ministry allocated funding and ACP created

“Call him paranoid if you like, but I think we can all agree Sordland is much less corrupt thanks to him. I certainly appreciate his efforts.”

-From a “Lachaven Times” interview with Nia Morgana, 1959

-Increased Corporate Taxes and maintained Small/Medium Business Taxes

	“Rayne makes fat cats pay their fair share”

	-”Radical Headline 1955

-Initiated education reform and privatization

“Keeping a state stranglehold on education only serves to allow one, biased voice to prevail. Our privatisation and reform will open up our children to being open-minded, critical thinking citizens whose fresh thinking will power Sordish greatness.”

	-Rayne in a radio address on the reforms, 1955

-Mechanized Gruni farms

“The Rayne administration cares about you, without you Sordland starves! We are bringing the future to Sordish agriculture, these subsidies will ensure that soon you will be producing much more for a fraction of the costs.”

	-Gus Manger in a speech to the West Gruni Farmers Cooperative, 1955

-Removed changed to Justices Immunity in exchange for conservative support.

“Mrs. Tory drove a hard bargain, but she was fair and honest. Hawker and Garaci are old men, they will die off eventually anyway I suppose.”

-“Presidential Journal of Anton Rayne: 1955” edited by Deana & Monica Rayne, 1985

-Trade War hit

	Holl: “This nonsense really comes at the worst time doesn’t it!”

Rayne: “The giants fight while we suffer in the middle.”

Holl: “We very well might be well and truly screwed this time.”

-Conversation recorded by one of Lucian Galade’s bugs, 1955

-From “A War of Words”, Rayne’s Autobiography, 1978

-He didn’t support Monica at the Benfi festival.

-Interview with Monica Rayne in “Anton Rayne: The Father of Sordish Democracy” 1985

-He chose to modernize the military

-Iosef Lancea in a press conference on the modernization announcement, 1955

-Sent the ACP after the Old guard 

“He came home that night and ranted and raved that he knew it, that the old guard existed. Greiser had said so. He didn’t go to sleep until one in the morning.”

-Interview with Monica Rayne in “Anton Rayne: The Father of Sordish Democracy” 1985

-Recognized Heljiland as Agnolian for a better trade deal and a military alliance.

“It was a masterful move of his beloved Sordish protectionism. We maintained our advantage and still got a deal with Agnolia. His vision was coming into focus, and it was very clever.”

	-From “A Life of Service”, Deivid Wisci’s Autobiography, 1960

-Did not trade with Wehlen 

	“Wehlen border need reinforcement immediately, more info upon return.”

	-Telegraph delivered to Iosef Lancea, 1955

	-Telegraph delivered to Deivid Wisci, 1955

-Removed Conscription and modernized the Air Force

“In a wise move the president has made the Sordish military a volunteer force, the next round of conscription will be the last. Furthermore, the Air Force has been chosen to receive the bulk of modernization, another wise choice to ensure Sordish air dominance.”

-Iosef Lancea in a radio address announcing the end of conscription, 1955

-Didn’t invest in a second mega-project

“He was still very spooked by the trade war, I think it is perhaps his only mistake economically. But I’m no economist.”

-“Alongside a Hero” by Petr Vectern, 1977

-Signed the Central Bank Reinforcement Act

“As this trade war has shown, Sordland needs to be ready for the tribulations of the world economy. In accordance with Sordish Protectionism we will enact protective measures to ensure future crises will have minimal effect.”

	-Symon Holl in a press conference on the act, 1955

-Didn’t privatize healthcare 

“I find it rather ironic that Ms. Walda was the one against privatization and I was for it, considering which of our ministries oversaw privatization, I suspect Rayne may have wanted to privatise healthcare but he wanted to protect the conservative vote.”

-Quote from Paskal Beniwoll in his biography “The Winding Path” by Carol Circas, 1979

-Decided to build new rural schools and improve existing rural schools

“Our work in revolutionizing education is not over. Our rural areas have been ignored for too long, and it is now our ministries goal to bring our rural areas to parity with our urban areas, ending this fundamental inequality.”

-Ciara Walda announcing the planned reforms, 1955

-Sold 1/3rd of Gascom shares

“This decision does not reflect a loss of faith in Gascom, but instead the administration's desire to reap the rewards of our savvy investments.”

-Press release, 1955

-Made teaching evolution mandatory but didn’t ban creationism

“This law is a slap in the face of our traditional values, we are sick of big city folks who have never done an honest day's work telling our children what is right, mandatory evolution education is no compromise. We are surprised Rayne would betray his faith like this, he must stop busy-body women like Ms. Walda and Ms. Morgana from controlling him.”

-Op-ed in a small town newspaper in Nargis, 1955

-Argued Bluds are Sords before the law

-Symon Holl in an interview with the Ekonomist, 1956

-Vetoed UELA

“He was a devoted assimilationist, but he thought the NFP was rushing the integration of the Bluds and were going to botch it by stirring up too much tension. He figured that by uplifting the Bluds to parity with Sords the would naturally assimilate into the larger Sordish population. He was clever like that.”

-“Alongside a Hero” by Petr Vectern, 1977

-Refused to sell shares to Koronti and Tusk

“Showering me in gifts like a child who can be bribed with sweets, fools. They ran away whining about consequences. I’ll have to keep an eye on them, can never be too careful.”

-“Presidential Journal of Anton Rayne: 1956” edited by Deana & Monica Rayne, 1985

-Sent Franc to military school

	-Franc Rayne’s speech upon accepting the position of Minister of Defense in 1994

-He decided to focus on the economy following this victory 

	Rayne: “Is protectionism not the right path Symon?” 

Holl: “I would prefer a more open approach, but the economy is bouncing back, even if it is slower than we thought.”

-Conversation recorded by one of Lucian Galade’s bugs, 1956

-Created the fair trade and competition commission, radio & television commission, and began the free medicine program

“Many of you know exactly what is wrong with you, but simply can’t afford treatment. What a travesty! We are making sure that changes. Furthermore, my dedication to integrity and truth has continued. The Fair Trade Commision will hold corrupt, bad-faith businesses accountable, ensuring you receive better products and services. The Media Commision will make sure you aren't sold lies and misinformation. My devotion to you citizens is unwavering!”

	-Patricio Alvarez in a address to Lespia on the alliance, 1956

-Had Livia arrested and shouldered the blame with Petr

“I never saw him angrier, not only had I committed adultery, something he hated, but I had compromised national security. I think my saving grace was ironically Lucian’s bugs. They uncovered Livia, and he was grateful for that, but finding out Lucian was secretly recording his co-workers was the beginning of his souring on Lucian.”

-“Alongside a Hero” by Petr Vectern, 1977

-Chose Albin Clavin as new VP

“I’ll admit I came to regret this choice, I suspected the man he was and asked the ACP if they’d found anything, but they hadn’t uncovered his corruption yet so I thought he was a good choice compared to the other options.”

Rayne in a interview on Sordland Today, 1965

-Deivid Wisci to reporters while meeting with Arcasian diplomats, 1956

-Expanded electronics industry 

“This economic initiative is designed to bring Sordland to the forefront of developed economies. Electronics are the future and few countries produce them. By subsidising this industry we can get a headstart and make our country a global supplier of technology.”

	Press Release, 1956

Chapter IV: Turbulence, 1957

--Interview with Monica Rayne in “Anton Rayne: The Father of Sordish Democracy” 1985

-Debt crisis hit

“It was the tensest moment in those four years, especially in my ministry. During the worst of it the economic reports were out of date just days after being finished. However, it showed the strength of Sordish Protectionism, the bank reenforcement act he signed in 1955 cushioned the blow significantly.”

-Interview with Symon Holl in “Anton Rayne: The Father of Sordish Democracy” 1985

-Signed minority rights act 

“President Rayne has proved himself willing to stand against the laws and systems that have artificially kept us divided, this will be a turning point!”

-Mansoun Leke in a interview, 1957

-Vetoed Human dignity act

“I honestly don’t know why he didn’t veto it, he was a devout Dastnurist and fired one of the maids when she got pregnant, and he turned the presidential guards upside down looking for the father. Maybe he wanted to consolidate the liberal vote, but then again he didn’t stop seeing Petr after the scandal. But many things about papa were a mystery to me.”

-Interview with Deana Marki in “Anton Rayne: The Father of Sordish Democracy” 1985

-Vetoed children's future bill

	“Rayne continues to abandon poor children”

-From “A War of Words”, Rayne’s Autobiography, 1978

-Approached the Rummish plane incident with diplomacy 

“I regret to inform you of the death of Neil Rothard, an air force pilot killed when his jet was shot down over Sordish territory by Rumburg. Rumburg has claimed he was over their territory. We believe this was an honest mistake and are willing to work with Queen Beatrice to clear the air and fix this mistake diplomatically.”

-Address to the public by Rayne, 1957

-Declined joining the ATO

“I am happy that the promise he made in 1957 held true. He told me if he won reelection he would happily join us but he thought it simply too big before an election – a logic I can’t fault. Sordland is better for his wise leadership.”

-President Dwight Walker in a speech to the ATO on Sordland’s entry, 1960

-Had Graf arrested, but not all Old Guard

“I’d never seen him more manic, all his years of being called paranoid were vindicated. Lucian told me later that he’d narrowly talked him out of purging all of the old guard from the government. He settled for Graf’s head but wasn’t happy with it completely.”

-Interview with Monica Rayne in “Anton Rayne: The Father of Sordish Democracy” 1985

-Achieved a Mixed Economy

“People of Sordland, I am ashamed to tell you that the recession still persists. Our infrastructure remains lackluster, unemployment is still steady at 16% – far too high. The economy has only grown by a few billion ren. You suffer greatly from this, and I promise that if you reelect me I will fix these issues. But not all is wrong! Our debt is 117 billion ren lower and inflation has dropped to 2%, the lowest ever in our history! We have built strong trade relationships with our neighbors while protecting Sordish industries, in fact they have never been more productive. Sordish Protectionism has shown its superiority to Alfonso's reckless Arcasian Capitalism and Soll’s stifling Autarky! Holsord wasn’t built in a day, and neither can the sleeping giant of the Sordish economy be awakened in just one term. A MORGNA WES CORE!”

-Rayne in Holsord campaign rally, 1957

-Had a successful interview with Sacker, Rumburg expelled from OMEC

“This is a terrible injustice upon us, the world refuses to see Rayne as the snake he is! We will not lie down, my loyal subjects I will ensure Rumburg is not overtaken by the imperialism of Sordland!

-Queen Beatrice Livingston in an address to her people, 1957

-Held a military parade 

“I was very lucky to run into president Rayne again four years later when I was a young recruit, but I don't think I made a good impression, I dropped my rifle and General Lancea gave a scolding for the ages.”

-Rudolf Sacwin, mourner at Rayne’s State Funeral, 1984

-Moved wealth to Kyrute

“It was a decision based in my worry of a coup by the old guard in response to my arrest of Ms. Graf, I admit my wrongdoing and hope we can move past this.”

	-Rayne in a press conference after Lucian Galade exposed Rayne during the formers trial, 1960

-AN supported Sordland 

“The AN has shown its devotion to peace with these actions, we are grateful for the quick investigation of our concerns.”

-Response to the decision from the Sordish Foreign Ministry, 1957 

-Promised greater security in his next term.

	“Promise of Security too little to late, 15 murdered by Young Sord thugs”

	-Headline in “Se Bludrat Ocar” (The Bludish Eye),  1957

-He won a second term, NFP won second and PFJP third, CPS won some seats but the Blud vote was decided and neither party won seats

I also did a glucose challenge test which showed high insulin (cant recall the name but you drink sugar water over 3hrs and have your blood taken). my LF CGM device has showed the following which i find strange:
- low glucose (3.7mmol/l) 5x during the night - was not sleeping on my side, woke up and monitored it and it continued to be low for 2hrs.
- 7.7 glucose upon waking
- drinking coffee and unsweetened soy milk dropped this to 5
- 7.8 on fasted morning run
- zero sugar/low carb whey protein shake spiked from 5.5 to 9
- eating carbs (orange, cereal, corn chips) results in my glucose falling 
- going for a walk after eating results in my glucose rising
the above seems the opposite of what should happen based on my (limited) understanding of blood sugar and insulin. i will obviously make an appt with my doctor to discuss, but if anyone has any idea whats happening to me i would be curious to know in the meantime. thanks in advance.

I want to make sure I’m not missing out on something even better just because I’m more familiar with one side of the island over the other. 

I know old town is all pretty walkable and it’s easy enough for us to get to both sides, but If you had to pick one resort for the weekend, which would you choose and why?

I made plans with my partner to get breakfast at our favorite local donut shop for breakfast and coffee. The cronut bites are most excellent. So yeah, a chill day. Driving around thrifting and checking for Shipt orders. #stayhustlin

Not too many orders today, so we've been to a few places: Goodwill, where she found a few dresses she liked, and an antique mall with lots of booths. Our last stop was at another antique mall, which prompted the #todayilearned post.

Today I learned that EarthBound, the SNES game I played as a kid (and lost), is currently owned by my girlfriend. (I forgot she had this, to be honest.) As we strolled through the mall, we came across a booth with retro games and consoles. (Finally, our type of nerdy!) Lo and behold, in the center of the display case, we see it: ""EarthBound Tested and authentic SNES cartridge $400 obo.""

My girlfriend said, ""Why is that game so much?"" and I replied, ""I don't know. Let me message my buddy and see what he says."" So I sent my friend a pic and asked, ""Why, though?"" He responded, ""Because it be,"" and I said, ""Alright then."" Then I told her, and she exclaimed, ""Oh, cool. Fuck  Kansas!™️ money!"" and I replied, ""Fuck yeah!"" Then my edible kicked in.

For your consideration: A sleeve of ten Vertuo capsules is about us$15, some cost much more, some a bit less. A household with two coffee drinkers, who brew two cups per day, will consume 120 capsules in a month, 1440 capsules in a year. The math is inescapable: that is $2000/year, much more if the household orders limited editions and super premium capsules. The Original system, slightly less expensive per capsule, offers no real savings because the household might brew twice as many of those tiny shots. 

 Third party OL capsules are not in play here because they’re mostly undrinkable. 

And not everyone who loves good coffee likes Nespresso output. There are so many other ways to brew great coffee. Grinding fresh beans from your local roster, faffing about with a sophisticated drip brewer, Aeropress, pour over, or espresso system is not for everyone,true, but the coffee is unbelievably superior and far less expensive.

I've been applying to entry-level jobs on Indeed/company websites and other job listings through emails 2 days out of every week since February 2024, I've only had one interview for a waitress position at a restaurant that I've heard nothing back from in months. I've applied to everything from Walmart, fast food places, Kennel work, dollar stores, pet stores, Veterinary Assistant work, coffee shops, being rejected entirely or hearing nothing back from the employer. At this point I just really need some work experience and I know I'm doing something wrong for being ignored/rejected. I don't know what to do in this situation other than ask for help or constructive criticism and keep applying for jobs.

I've added as many things to my resume as I can that are relevant (or so I believe) including my experience as a trade-show vendor. I honestly don't have much to work off of without securing some kind of job that I can add to my resume, and I've been told that I would have more luck getting a job if I'm already actively employed which feels like a slap to the face with the situation I'm in. It really doesn't help that I am a massive introvert with poor social skills and a diagnosed Anxiety disorder, but I am really trying to improve that for the sake of employment.

I've heard from friends and family that are in similar situations with struggling to get ahold of a job in my area, and they have way more job experience than I do so its even more disheartening on my outlook. I'm sorry if this is more of a rant than asking for advice, I just feel worried about my future with so much being reliant on me on top of other issues I won't share here.

Home kitchen organization is crucial for creating a functional and enjoyable cooking space. A well-organized kitchen not only maximizes efficiency but also enhances the overall aesthetic of your home. From pantry storage to countertop management, implementing effective organizational strategies is essential for any homeowner.

One of the first steps in achieving effective home kitchen organization is decluttering your space. Begin by removing items that are no longer needed or used. Here are some tips for decluttering:

- Sort through utensils and gadgets; discard duplicates.
- Organize pantry items by category and consider expiration dates.
- Assess cookware and bakeware; keep only what you frequently use.

Next, consider utilizing vertical space to enhance organization. Tall cabinets and shelves can store items that are not used daily while keeping essential tools within reach. Investing in pull-out racks and tiered organizers can maximize visibility and accessibility. Additionally, labeling containers and shelves can streamline your cooking process by ensuring you know where everything is located.

Drawer organization is another vital aspect of home kitchen organization. Use dividers to separate utensils or create designated spaces for different tools. This not only saves time during cooking but also prevents drawers from becoming overcrowded and chaotic.

Don’t overlook the importance of countertop organization. Keep frequently used appliances, like toasters and coffee makers, at the forefront while hiding away less-used gadgets. Utilizing baskets or decorative containers can help maintain a clean and tidy appearance while ensuring easy access to necessary items.

Finally, maintain your home kitchen organization by regularly reassessing your set-up. Seasonal decluttering and rearranging can help uphold a pleasant and efficient cooking environment, making your culinary experiences more enjoyable.

Should I buy?","I randomly found a 2020 Arteon SEL Front Wheel Drive with 43K miles on it for $21,000 at a well established/rated luxury car dealership. They have had the car for about a month and in that short time they have dropped it from 23k to 21k. Price is less than Kelly and shows one owner, no wrecks and looks like basic maintenance has been performed at normal intervals. Took it for a ten minute spin and noticed no issues. Side note, it does show owner was commercial use. According to the sales guy, the previous owner came in and traded it in towards a new car. I feel like I could probably wiggle them down to $19,500 to $20,000 with a little talking, but if I can't is this still a deal at $21k? I own two paid off 2016 Kia Optimas that have both had engines replaced by Kia so they both technically have decently low mileage for the year on the engines. I'm giving one of them to my daughter who is just starting college.

My wife works from home so this would basically be hers as a drop kid off at school, coffee, workout, grocery getting car. She still averages about 15k miles a year though. Any crazy side things or maintenance issues with these? I keep cars for the full extent of loan (5 years) than I usually keep them as long as they don't start causing me major troubles. I'm an average DIY'er. I can do the usual brakes, rotors, oil change, plugs, basic sensors if I can reach, but I'm not a deep digger and what scares me is with the rarity of these in the states I don't see youtube walking me through how to change a (insert name here) on these on the fly.

My main goals last year (which will continue this year) were to shop and eat out less, and to save up for an upcoming trip. Last year I also started investing more seriously, but for now I’m prioritising putting more in my Kiwisaver over Hatch to save for a house deposit.

1i03jlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1i03jlb/something_is_stalking_me_and_i_cant_kill_it/,Something is stalking me and I can't kill it.,"I need help. I am currently writing this in a shitty motel room I scraped the last of my money for, scared for my life. I am writing this as a last resort. My friends don't believe me and neither do the police.  I am a 22F who lives in a small cottage in the woods with my English setter, Johnny. I got Johnny a few years ago as my hunting companion. His breed is trained to stalk and point to birds so you can find and shoot them. It was all around 6 months ago I started noticing weird things happening around my house. It was small things at first, like noticing windows in my house were cracked even when I was sure I closed them. It didn't take long before this thing started doing shit right in my face instead of waiting for me to find them. I woke up one night to Johnny crying, pressing his weight into me, pointing his snout to the bedroom window. This was enough to instantly wake me up and make my stomach drop. I stayed still trying to focus my eyes in the pitch black room. I reached for the lamp on the nightstand, but I couldn't help hesitate. I knew if someone or something was there, it was better for me to know asap whether or not to grab the shotgun under my bed. But there was a childish part of me that wanted to believe that if I just put my head in the covers and went back to sleep everything would be alright. Like whatever was there would give up after a while and decide to leave me alone. But I knew that wasn't an option, so it wasn't long before I switched on the lamp. My worst nightmare came true when I saw a black figure speed past the window as soon as the light hit it. It was so fast I almost convinced myself it was just my tired eyes adjusting to the sudden light change. It was too fast to be human. But I knew I wasn't crazy when Johnny started running frantically around the room barking, as if he was telling me he lost sight of whatever was standing there. I got up as fast as I could and grabbed the gun under the bed, tiptoeing my way to my bedroom door. I pressed my ear up to the door and stayed quiet, listening for the sounds of someone possibly breaking in. The silence made my ears ring and eventually Johnny calmed down. If I am being completely honest, I was too much of a pussy to open that door. Instead I locked myself in, closed my curtains, and stayed in there until Johnny's bladder couldn't hold it anymore. I spent the next few days constantly looking over my shoulder, barely eating from the anxiety. What oddly made it worse is that the next few days were quiet. No windows were left cracked, no noises at night... You think that'd make me feel better but it just made me feel like I was going crazy. I knew I didn't imagine it because Johnny saw it too, but how did I know he wasn't just freaking out because he had to pee? Maybe there was a deer or something walking outside the window that was spooked by the light. About a week after, just when I thought everything was fine, this thing came back worse than before. It would wake me up by slamming every door, cabinet, and window in my house all at once. Plants in my yard would go missing like they were never there to begin with. I'd lie in bed at night, hearing scraping along the walls and ceiling. All the lights in the house suddenly stopped working past 9 pm. I would wake up to scratches up and down my arms. This went on for months and I could feel it eat away at my brain. It felt like a leech sucking my consciousness out of me. My days started blending together and my anxiety was at a constant. The word ""anxiety"" doesn't capture the terror I felt in my stomach at every waking moment. I would go days without eating without even realizing. I had gotten visibly smaller over the months and I think since this whole thing I've lost about 95 pounds. I know you're all wondering why I didn't sprint out the door the second I saw something peering at me as I slept and it comes down to one factor: money. I simply don't have the money to move and it didn't help when I started reaching out to my friends about it. I met my friends at a coffee shop in town and I told them everything. The noises, the plants, the figure I saw. I don't know how I expected them to react, but they just stared at me silently for a few seconds. I got that sudden feeling of just oh fuck, I shouldn't have said that. I wanted nothing more to take it back and I don't know why. I felt almost embarrassed talking about it. ""Are you getting enough sleep?"" My friend, Chelsea asked me. ""No, but I mean that's not an issue. This thing is keeping me awake."" I immediately got defensive. No fucking way they're gonna brush it off that I'm just tired? All she did was sigh and she looked to our other friend at the table. ""Audrey..."" she trailed off. ""I know you think you know what you saw, but I think it might be time to talk to your psychiatrist."" For the first time in a few months I wasn't anxious, I was furious. My palms started sweating and my knee started bouncing. ""Are you fucking kidding me?"" They drop their heads and sigh again. Are they treating this like an intervention right now? ""We're just worried about you. You have to keep in mind your genetics, Audrey. Your mom was diagnosed with schizophrenia and it's very possible it could've been passed down to you. It's nothing to be ashamed of, we just want to help."" Chelsea tried pleading with me but I didn't say anything, I just stood up and walked away. I held my composure til I turned my back from them and I couldn't hold the tears anymore. I knew what I saw. I knew what I heard. I knew what I felt. If I'm completely honest, I stopped at the dispensary before going home. I knew it probably wasn't the smartest to be on a substance while I potentially have something stalking me, but I couldn't take the gut wrenching anxiety anymore. And honestly that night was the most peace I had experienced in the last few months. Maybe it was the weed, but either way I wasn't complaining. It was even the first night I was able to go to sleep without pills. Johnny was quick to interrupt my sleep to tell me he had to pee though. It was around 3 am when I opened the back door and let him out. I usually didn't like to leave Johnny outside at night alone because of predators and the fear of him getting through the fence, but at that moment I whole heartedly believed I was gonna pee myself. I jogged down the hallway to my bathroom and before I could make it, I heard Johnny yelp outside. I turned around as fast as I possibly could and ran down the hallway. Johnny was standing on top my patio furniture out back, staring at me. His eyes were the biggest I had ever seen them. He looked horrified but he was as still as could be, just staring at me. Something felt weird but I was still a little high and I just wanted to make sure my sweet boy was okay. I let him in and start feeling around his body, looking for any cuts or scrapes he might've gotten outside. He usually hated me touching his legs and his paws, but right now he was just standing there as still as he was standing outside. He was looking straight ahead, almost like he was a statue. I ended up finding a hell of a scrape on one of his ankles. I touched it and he had no reaction, even though it was a pretty good gash. I looked closer at it and I saw there wasn't any visible blood. I stopped like a deer in headlights.  I looked at the black spots on his coat and they looked out of place. Almost like when you put a fitted sheet on wrong. His skin stretched weirdly over his body, like it was 2 inches too short. I looked at his head and he was just staring straight ahead of him. I knew this wasn't Johnny. I fought tears back, images of what could've happened to Johnny went through my head. I had to figure something out. Who knew what this thing would do to me when I fell asleep. ""Awww poor baby look on your foot."" I said in a fake sympathetic voice. This flipped a switch and this thing started wagging its tail and licking my face. I felt sick to my stomach. I brought it over to the kitchen, half ass wrapping the foot and getting ""Johnny"" ready for bed. ""Okay, let's go to bed!"" These four words would usually have him sprinting down the hallway into our bedroom. Except this time he stood at my feet, staring at me with big puppy eyes. There was an excited look on his face that made me want to fall to my knees and cry. ""Johnny get in the fucking bedroom!"" I yelled. I tried to act as normal as I could but fuck I just wanted to call a quits and let this thing kill me. The only thing that kept me going was the off chance of my real Johnny being outside right now, scared and alone and hurt. This thing scurried off into my bedroom and it was obvious it moved weird. Instead of taking a step with his front foot and the opposite back foot, he'd step with both feet on the same side. He moved almost side to side like a train on tracks. I heard him creep around the bedroom, his nails scraping the floor like he was being dragged. I knew my only chance was grabbing my shotgun from under the bed. I was far too weak for any physical fight. I was basically skin and bones and Johnny was no small dog, he was a tall dog at about 95 pounds. He was practically as big as I was at that point. I slowly made my way to the bedroom, staying as quiet as possible. My whole body was shivering and twitching. It felt like my body was going to collapse under me at any moment. He started to bark at me and even his bark was different. Johnnys usual bark was deep and loud, but this bark was high pitched, almost like a shriek. I was quickly losing my patience with this fucking monster. In that moment I honestly just wanted to knock the shit out of it. I knew I'd die in the process, but all I wanted to do was go out swinging. But I had to try and find Johnny. I turned around the corner to see it sitting on my bed. It looked like a cartoon of a dog, laying down looking at me, it's tail wagging with its head tilted and its tongue hanging out the side of its mouth. Except it still looked off. It's tongue was a little too long, his eyes were too far apart, his teeth went too far back in his mouth, and he had that same excited look in his eyes. I smiled, putting my hands on my hips. ""Johnny, we almost forgot your dinner!"" I say as excited as I could, my voice was shaking with every word. ""It's in the kitchen, baby boy. Finish then come to bed, ok?"" It quickly got off the bed and made it's way for the kitchen. I grabbed my shotgun and loaded it, running to the door and standing at the end of the hallway. It started making its way back to the bedroom when it realized there was no food. It stood there at the other end of the hallway, staring at me. The excited look hadn't left and I would be lying if I didn't say that was the most unsettling part. Like it knew something I didn't and it was just two steps ahead. I shut my eyes and started firing. The shots lit up the dark hallway, and I think I fired about 4 shots until the gun stopped. I opened my eyes to see it oozing and convulsing on the floor. It made a sort of gasping sound as it thrashed around and it had a strong sulfur smell to it. Its shape kept morphing between Johnny, a deer, and a man I didn't recognize. It scared the living fuck out of me but I focused on running out the back door to go find Johnny. I walked outside with my gun in my hand, calling out for him. It was about 10 minutes before I found him. I found him in a ditch, brush and vines tangled around him. The way the vines wrapped around him locked his legs bent under him. I was scared I was too late until he raised his head to look at me. I ripped away the plants and he shot up toward me. He pushed himself into me like he couldn't get close enough. He was wet and shaking. We sat there for a second before quickly making our way to the truck. I sped down the remote streets, constantly looking in my rear view mirror. We drove to the nearest police station where I told an officer everything that's happened. I thought it was finally over until the cop looked at me the same way my friends did. ""Ma'am are you under the influence of any substance tonight?"" The tears I had been holding back all night finally fought their way out. I didn't even try to argue. This thing got what it wanted. It watered me down into a shell of the person I was before and I was too weak to fight. After tonight, all I cared about was making sure Johnny was safe. I drove him over to Chelseas house and let him through the gate into her backyard. I knew she wouldn't be happy, but she was the only person I could trust to take care of him. This takes me to now, sitting in this shitty motel room, waiting for this thing to inevitably break in. I've been here for about 2 days and I think its followed me. I still hear scraping along the walls and ceiling. The lights still don't work past 9 pm. Windows are still being cracked open. It feels like its starting its twisted game all over again. I am tired of living in fear. The leech in my brain is getting bigger and I can feel it pulse every minute of every day. I feel like I've gone completely fucking crazy and I need help. I don't know how much longer I can fight this thing.",2,1736734490.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

For the past year I've been having this weird chest pressure. I wasn't really thinking too much about it until this fall when I started having more small heart palpitations (but no more chest pressure) and really intense panic attacks. Every time I would feel a palpitation I would start panicking. I've had so many EKG's done in 2024, I had blood tests, urine tests, and in November, I had an echo and everything always came back normal except for a pretty high EF of 74%. I was fine over the holidays until the start of this week. I started feeling the weirdest thing in my chest. I don't know if it's a palpitation, but it feels like a super big beat or like a big jump or jolt or something like that, and then my heart rate goes up and I panic. What I noticed is that it usually happens after I eat. Because my stomach starts making weird noises and I feel the need to burp. But the palpitation is SO strong it almost hurts so I am convinced it has to be cardiac related. I don't feel dizzy or anything afterwards, just very anxious. Also sometimes, I feel that same feeling in my chest but it's not as intense so I don't panic and I notice that my pulse is not out of whack or anything so I'm like : could it be GI related? Also sometimes they get worse when I lie down. Sometimes I am about to fall asleep and I feel it and it makes it hard to fall asleep. I am so scared, it's making it hard to live my life normally.

Do you love chaos? Have you mastered the art of staying calm while the world burns around you? Then step right up, because I, an overstretched mother of four (walking natural disasters), am hiring a Remote IT Analyst to untangle the mess that is my life. Must have CBAP (Can’t Believe Anyone’s Productive) and PMP (Projects? More Pain!) certifications—or at least be good at faking it. Bonus points if you know how to handle technology, rogue pets, and The Great Grandma Janine Internet Romance Saga of 2025.

A Day in the Life

Welcome to Madness HQ, where you’ll help keep the wheels from falling off my unhinged remote life. You’ll be working alongside my four kids (ages 4, 7, 12, and 16) who treat every hour like an episode of Survivor: Sibling Smackdown.
	•	My 7-year-old is always super determined, which means she’s a bright, creative genius with a tendency to turn every simple activity into a 57-step science experiment. She just taught the hamster how to use a pulley system. Meanwhile, my 4-year-old is trying to eat glue, my teenager is perfecting the art of passive-aggressive eye rolls, and my 12-year-old is convinced he’s the next big YouTuber despite having zero content ideas.

And let’s not forget the real MVPs of chaos: the animals.
	•	The ancient cat (Sir Licksalot) has decided the dog’s tail is his mortal enemy and spends every waking moment swatting at it from various ambush points.
	•	The dog, Rufus, retaliates by barking at invisible enemies while projectile vomiting questionable substances.
	•	Meanwhile, Mr. Nibbles the hamster, who was last seen rappelling from the ceiling fan, is leading his own personal escape revolution.

Oh, and then there’s Grandma Janine, who’s ignoring her family’s entirely reasonable concerns about her oil rig boyfriend, “Chad.” She’s convinced he’s her soul mate, even though he keeps forgetting her name.

Your Responsibilities (Godspeed)
	•	Resolve tech issues like why Seesaw, Google Classroom, and “that weird portal from 1998” are all conspiring to make me cry.
	•	Help me figure out why Rufus ate my charging cable. Again.
	•	Track down Mr. Nibbles before he makes it to the neighbor’s house.
	•	Be the intermediary when Sir Licksalot escalates his war with Rufus to DEFCON 1.
	•	Coach Grandma Janine on why she should drop “Mr. Oil Rig” and move on to Dr. Sebastian, a dreamy humanitarian saving injured children while galloping through an Eastern European war zone on a white horse.

Qualifications
	•	CBAP (Can’t Believe Anyone’s Productive)
	•	PMP (Projects? More Pain!)
	•	Previous experience surviving chaos, preferably in a zoo, daycare, or reality TV production.
	•	Fluent in Zoom troubleshooting, hamster evasion tactics, and comforting someone mid-meltdown without also melting down yourself.
	•	A Ph.D. in Sarcasm preferred but not required.

Benefits
	•	Salary: $0, but I’ll let you keep any quarters you find in the couch cushions.
	•	Housing: A premium pup tent in the backyard, strategically located near Rufus’ favorite “digging spot.”
	•	Mental Health: Unlimited sessions with TherapyGeese™, the revolutionary app that pairs you with an AI goose to scream supportive affirmations in your direction.
	•	Food: Unlimited coffee, slightly stale goldfish crackers, and my kids’ abandoned PB&J crusts.
	•	Perks: Full access to my doom-scrolling habit and a lifetime supply of stress-induced sarcasm.

IMPORTANT: SHARE THIS FAR AND WIDE

Please post this job listing on every site you can think of, starting with offshore (seriously, let’s aim for at least 12 time zones away). Forward it to your friends, family, enemies, and any internet forums where desperate IT analysts gather. Our goal is 404 applications per second—because if enough people hit “apply,” maybe this life will stop resembling a live-action disaster movie.

How to Apply

Send your résumé, three references, and a heartfelt essay on why Grandma Janine should dump Chad for the hot, bare-chested, “Yes, you can have my routing number” Dr. Sebastian to ScreamingIntoTheVoid@ChaosMomInc.com. Applications will be reviewed between toddler’s 3 a.m. snack demands and the time Sir Licksalot steps on my face at dawn.

We'd only been together for 5 months, known each other for about a year, so not nearly as traumatic a breakup as the years-long relationships I've had in the past. Still, the sudden nature of it left me with a lot of unresolved questions and confusion. I was especially sad that when we ended things, he was shut down and didn't feel like the person I'd been dating. 

Today I sat down and imagined him showing up months later to talk things out over coffee. I imagined it highlighting all of his worst qualities - the way he would talk down about people he considered less intelligent than himself, being dismissive of my feelings, getting short-tempered, etc. Then I imagined the same coffee chat, only this time he was reflective, open, and kind. I asked my questions, and got honest but thoughtful answers. I imagined him asking if I would try again and telling him I couldn't, and listing all of the reasons I wouldn't be able to justify getting back together. I ended it by hugging him and wishing him well, which is how I wish it could have gone. 

Something about that process really made me feel lighter, and more at peace with things. It felt like a much more productive and meaningful outlet for my sadness than ruminating on all of the different things I could have done to prevent the breakup. I don't know if this will help others, but it really helped me. Thought it was worth sharing in case it benefitted anyone else.  ",1,1736734092.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Chasing my TF for 2 years.,"I’m new to this Twin Flame stuff (after two years of trying to find answers). I used to be focused entirely on unity with my ‘twin flame’, but now I’m trying to get to a place where I can be happy with or without him.  

Our Story: I met the most wonderful man about 2 years ago. We went on 2 coffee dates early on and he’s made excuses to avoid getting together again, but we’ve been talking and texting ever since…. for two whole years. 

We had the most intense connection when we met. We met at randomly a coffee shop and when he said hello, it was like time stopped and we were the only two people who existed. The conversation was so easy between us and every move me made felt like we were dancing. We chatted for a couple hours during our initial meeting, and then agreed to meet for dinner that night. He stood me up for dinner and made some excuse later. We had another amazing coffee date a couple weeks later. I suggested getting together multiple times after, but he always had an excuse. I know he’s equally attracted to me. We both agreed that we’d never experienced this type of intense connection before and he even shared some romantic daydreams that me echo my own limerence-style thoughts. So I don’t think this is a one-sided connection, although it feels that way sometimes. 

I haven’t been able to stop thinking about him for the past two years. I even went no contact for 6 months, hoping that would get him out of my head, but nothing changed. I made some excuse to get back in contact and he was so excited to hear from me again, but still no interest in meeting in person. Since then we’ve just been texting without any plan to see each other again, we even stopped speaking on the phone. Now we just have this weird text-only relationship with little substance. 

I haven’t been looking for signs or synchronicities since I’m new to this. But I can’t deny that our dynamic mimics the twin flames journey. I know the endgame is to surrender to the journey and realize that this connection is about developing a relationship with a higher power, but I’m not sure I even know what that means. 

Right now I’m trying to get to a place of non-attachment, where I can be open to a relationship with him if he desires it, but without the painful attachment to it. I want to open my heart to other romantic relationships. I want to live my life without feeling tormented by ‘the one that got away’.  I want to love him enough so that I can be happy for him even if he chooses not to be with me. I want to love myself enough so that I can be happy even if he isn’t with me. But how the hell do I get there?

I guess my question is… has anyone gotten to a place where they can be happy and content without their twin flame? Has anyone had other healthy, fulfilling romantic relationships during separation? I’d love to hear stories of positivity without unity.",1,1736733945.0,twinflames,0,1.0,False
1i03cgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1i03cgc/had_a_terrible_experience_and_quite_frankly_its/,Had a terrible experience and quite frankly its kinda shattered me.,"I (42M) have been a longtime Bumble user - maybe around 10 years and even signed up to the lifetime premium subscription. While it goes without saying the quality of people on the app has deteriorated quite a bit - I still stick to this app because of the subscription and when I've been in between relationships / looking to date.

I matched with a girl day before yesterday (I could see her on the queue) and she was a little aggressive in the chat (the kind that makes you need to prove yourself). When her opening prompt was what dog would you be I said Golden Retriever and she said you are NOT a golden retriever - bla bla. Regardless she wanted to switch over to WhatsApp the next day and she asked to meet for coffee.

Now it was a Sunday and I was mildly hungover from the day before but I still put in the effort to get ready and get there on time. She was there and from the get go it was hostile. Everything I asked was met with one word answers - she claimed she was coming down with a migraine and I even offered to run outside and get some painkillers if that would help. By this time I ordered a coffee but things weren't improving by the time the coffee arrived. At some point she asked ""how long ago were your photos taken"" - I said fairly recently, its just that I've decided not to dye my beard and hair because one I like the salt and pepper look and I personally feel dye on guys seems unnatural. 

I was just met with one word answers throughout at which point as said, I can take the hint, is something wrong - to which she said ""I would rather be by myself right now"". I got up, coffee untouched put some cash (more than what the coffee would cost) on the table and left.

I kinda had decided on no dates for 2025 and I broke my rule + had the shittiest dating experience I think of my entire life. On the way back I was having intrusive thoughts as to whether I currently look like ass - nothing on my profile is misrepresented - my height, age, weight etc. I've never had a girl tell me I'm not the person in my pictures so this was definitely a new one for me.

What happened to people even getting to know each other. Bear in mind that this girl was divorced at 23 and is currently 40 - surely at this age there is some maturity about getting to know the person? She had a very ugly tattoo on her arm that wasn't in her pictures and she had a potbelly that was evident when she stood up - her photos too conveniently excluded all this. But at my age you look past that - i thought it was about getting to know the person. I wasn't even given a chance. I'm not lamenting about losing ""the one"" or something, just about the way it went down and I felt I was treated badly.

I thought typing this out will help get it out of my system - I didn't really sleep well last night, I saw she put some snarky comment on Twitter about this and I was very tempted to say my side of the story but I held back.",2,1736733861.0,Bumble,3,0.75,False

I'm a 35m that dated this 40f on and off for about 3 years and I am having trouble understanding what happened in the end. I'm looking for insight or advice, or maybe a shared similar experience to help me make sense of all of this, and properly move on from her. There has been a pattern to this relationship that I refuse to partake in anymore.

\-We matched on Tinder. She messaged me first. She engaged with me. We went on a date, spoke a ton about our goals, values and what we wanted, and there was alignment. After about a month of dating she told me she had feelings and wanted to be exclusive. I accepted. First time someone ever asked me to be their gf.

\-She is a super busy mom of 3 kids and works two jobs. Our schedules conflicted often but when we hung out we would always have a great time, and the sex was incredibly passionate. I made sure she was always pleased. Over time I fell in love with her hard.

\-After about 2 months she said she needed space and was feeling stressed and wanted to be alone. She still had feelings for her ex-husband.

\-I was hurt. After granting space a couple weeks later she would message me seeing how I am doing and ask to come over for a coffee. She came over, we would open up about our feelings, told me she slept with her ex-husband, somehow I forgave her, we ended up making love, and suddenly we were back together.

\-Cycle repeated over and over. Every single time she was stressed she would totally disengage from the relationship. Every stress was different, sometimes it was money, sometimes it was because her car, sometimes it was family, sometimes it was because of her kids. Discovered attachment theory, found out she totally fits the description for someone with avoidant attachment. At the time I fit the bill for anxious attachment, and took a ton of therapy since then to become secured. I suppose that was a blessing in a way.

\-After a few times I said f this. Some of the times I got mad and told her off and blocked her everywhere, followed by unblocking and apologizing after I cooled down. Most of the time I just lovingly let her go, following dating advice from Corey Wayne to just love freely and let go, and focus on my purpose, and avoid difficult women. Ok.

\-But everyday I would think about her. Heck, I'd think her about almost every minute of every day.

\-Again she apologized, we got back together, nothing really changed although I found myself less attached and less hurt each time, thanks to therapy and also just understanding that it was nothing I did wrong. I discovered something important about myself - communication is the most important thing for me in a relationship. Whenever communication lacked, and she hid her feelings or thoughts, I suffered.

\-For the next while I gave it absolutely everything. I loved her with all my heart. Love notes, gifts, flowers, dates, accommodating her needs as best as I could...even when we had our struggles we had (and still have) no doubts that the love was real. We jammed with a band together. We really did have some great times, although they were far and few between.

\-She was always tired. Constantly exhausted from work and her kids. Felt like whenever we were together she would just give me breadcrumbs, all we ever started doing was chilling at her place and Netflix and chill. Soon her coparent scheduled changed from 1 week on to 2 weeks with kids at a time. She always wanted to spend quality times with her kids, which I respect and understand as I am a single dad too. I started to feel like I was missing out on life. In my opinion she never really had time or energy for a serious relationship and was kidding herself. 

\-She took therapy because apparently the relationship was hard on her too. She expressed it wasn't what she wanted, and she didn't know what she needed, let alone how to communicate those things, and expectations of me. Sex was the strongest thing about our relationship but that was about it.

\-Over time it just felt like she was not interested in anything to do with my life, or my thoughts and opinions. She would routinely disengage. I tried to not make much of it, after all we are different people. But we would go on dates and have nothing to talk about. All she ever talked about is her problems or her family, or gossip, and I am a nerdy intellectual who loves to talk about anything other than that stuff. The last time I stayed at her place was exactly like this. I thought were both just tired, but no. I asked her if everything was okay. She said yes. As soon as I got home though she opened up by text. It really frustrated me because I had told her many times how important it was for me to have these convos in person, but she didn't really care.

I lovingly said ok all the best, you have my friendship but from here on out I am going to date someone else and have not heard from her since. Funny thing is I have already met someone incredible, and a good communicator, with 0 baggage...but I think I made the mistake of dating too soon. I am still grieving hard. I have told this person and she totally understands, but yeah.

I have no doubts that in the next few days or week my ex will text my ""how are you doing"", or ""have a good week"", and I got to be honest here, I don't know what the heck to do. In the past I have just matched and mirror, good thx hbu, ok, blahblah, take care! But it always reboots the cycle. I hate ignoring people. I think blocking is immature. I'm upset and sad, and in a lot of pain, and don't want to lie about my feelings to her, but I also don't want to make her feel guilty either and I also don't want to give her the satisfaction that this was the right thing. She has no idea what she lost. There are not many guys that will give someone so many chances, and make so many compromises. I do wish her the best, but am struggle finding the balance between feeling righteous about putting myself first, without being a total dick in the process.

I think I have been through enough. I think just peacefully ignoring her completely is the best thing to do. I have already gotten rid of all the photos of us together and deleted all texts. Now I just need to train myself to stop thinking about her when I catch myself reminiscing. I just feel so dumb. This relationship was far from logical and I don't know why I kept taking her back.

And my new gf is completely amazing. I feel like an idiot for still being in love with someone who treated me like garbage, all while not being able to give my whole self to this new person.

TLDR: Struggling moving forward from a messy relationship with an avoidant and looking for any advice you might have to help me stay positive.

Man. My 1.5 year old Great Pyr/Catahoula X named Kirby is just such a handful and every day I think about how much I want him to be a older dog already. He's a sweet dog, very friendly and playful but God he just never stops. Can't free roam the house yet, because he chews on things he shouldn't and he swallows them. But the past few weeks he has decided to rebel in the crate and now barks for up to 20 minutes after going in (he has loved it and has had no issues ever in the crate until now). I wanted so badly to let him free roam, because with my other dog we only used the crate for potty training and he was free roam by 4.5 months old and has never, ever had an issue. But Kirby is a bored chewer, and will ignore the chews we put out for them when we leave in favor of finding something ""new"" to chew that we can't really puppy proof, like the cat tree or the coffee table leg or the phone cord that was stapled and painted into the baseboards (and of course the bitter sprays don't make a difference for him). No matter how much exercise he gets, every time we have attempted him free roaming he chews something up. So he's in the crate every time we leave now. I don't know how to keep trying to get him to free roam status without potentially also putting him through an emergency obstruction surgery 😩

Don't even get me started on walks. I've ceased to exist to him outside. We barely make it out in front of the house, working on him staying with me and not pulling my arm off to get to the next new exciting smell. I've been doing the turn around method since he was a puppy to teach leash pressure and that a loose leash means we kept walking. For a blissful period from when he was 4mo-11mo he was great on leash. But then a switch flipped and now I'm just the boring old cement block on the other end of this torture rope that is keeping him from sprinting to all of the cool and awesome smells. God forbid there is another dog in the general vicinity. I'm the person you see plowing ahead while dragging their jumping, leash biting, twisting, lunging, full body wagging doofus if a dog behind her. 

I am just so tired of him. Tired of adolescence. Hating the fact that he's a big dog at 80lbs and is maturing MUCH slower than my 50lb older dog, and I know this adolescent period is going to last so much longer. Ugh. I love him but I freaking hate him sometimes. I want this to be over. Walking my older dog alone now makes me cry from how blissfully peaceful it is compared to walks with the 18mo old menace of a teenager, Kirby. Ugh.

What we have been doing is only opening up 2 portafilters per day, as we don’t really have a use for the third. We rotate through them and make sure that in a week’s time they’ve all been used fairly equally. 

Management has told us that moving forward we need to use all three evenly, each day. That claim it’s better for the machine and whatnot. 

My argument is that all of the portafilters get used evenly, just on separate days which should be enough for the machine to keep in tune if you will. Management is still unhappy and requires all three in use. I’m worried this will add too much responsibility to our day in terms of cleaning the extra portafilter and head. For more context, none of our management team works on the floor, one completely from home, the other works in the kitchen only making food. 

Here’s where you come in.

1. Do we have to use every portafilter every day? If so, can you help me understand why?

2. If no, How should I approach management starting my claim, without being too confrontational?

POTENTIAL KIDNAPPING ATTEMPT AT DUNDAS SQUARE

Hey everyone, I wanted to share a scary experience my friends and I had this past Friday night at Dundas Square to warn others. I’m 18F, and I was with two friends (both 19M) and my boyfriend (19M). We had just exited the subway and climbed the stairs, and there he was—a random guy standing there who immediately started talking to us. At first, we honestly thought he was just a homeless man, as we’ve always tried to be kind to people in similar situations. We regularly try to buy coffee or offer cigarettes to people who are homeless, and we know how lonely it can get on the streets, so we always make an effort to talk.

But things quickly felt off when he started offering us food, drinks, alcohol, and weed. At first, we thought it was just a sketchy situation, but we knew we could defend ourselves if someone turned violent. We were really broke, so we decided to go along with it thinking we weren’t in immediate danger. He ended up spending $50 on weed and smoked with my friends, but he kept focusing on me. Despite repeatedly telling him I didn’t smoke, he kept pushing me to try it. My boyfriend doesn’t smoke, so the guy started trying to get him drunk instead, constantly offering to buy him alcohol. It felt like he was really intent on getting us all under the influence.

Then, he insisted we all go to a movie. He mentioned that he had just gotten out of prison and was really eager to watch something with us. We reluctantly agreed, thinking we might get a free movie out of it (in hindsight, bad decision, I know). When we got to the theater in the mall and found out it was closed, things got even sketchier. He asked to take a group photo to “show the cinema they lost customers.” By that point, we didn’t want to be around him anymore, so we covered our faces. I was hiding behind my boyfriend and threw up a peace sign to block my face, but he kept adjusting the angle, clearly trying to get a shot of me specifically.

After that, he offered to “get cars” to take us to another theater. We were done by then and said no, but he followed us the whole time, pressuring us to go with him. When we started saying no, he started trying to intimidate us, throwing around Toronto slang and trying to act gangster, as if he thought that would scare us into agreeing. We decided to head toward TMU (Toronto Metropolitan University) because it seemed safer with more people around. I was sick with pneumonia and have asthma, so I slowed down a bit, and that’s when things got really scary. He noticed I was lagging behind and started speed walking toward me, like he was waiting for an opportunity. I yelled out to my friends, and as soon as they turned toward me, he backed off.

We eventually reached a courtyard where people were playing hockey, and we finally felt safe because there were others around. What really freaked us out was how he stopped right at the edge of the courtyard and didn’t step in, like he knew exactly where security cameras or guards might be. He stood there, yelling for us to come back, but didn’t follow us further.

At one point, while we were still in the mall near the movie theater, we saw a security guard in the lobby. We asked if they could help us in any way, explaining the situation. We even offered to hit my vape inside or just pretend to argue with him so they could pretend to call the cops, just to scare him off without us having to escalate things or get physical. Unfortunately, the security guards refused, saying, “My supervisor isn’t here and I don’t want to get involved.” I understand that people can be scary and unpredictable, but it was really frustrating that no one stepped in to help us.

Looking back, it’s clear he was trying to get us under the influence and lure us into a “car” he kept mentioning. He might have assumed we were underage, but we’re just broke college students who made a bad decision. Thankfully, we’re okay, but it was a close call, and I want to warn everyone to stay alert, especially around Dundas Square.

I know we were dumb for going along with him for the free stuff, but we learned our lesson. Please trust your instincts and get away from anyone who seems overly pushy or sketchy.

TL;DR:
On Friday night, a random guy at Dundas Square tried to lure me and my friends (2M, 1BF) with free alcohol, weed, and a movie, but his behavior quickly turned sketchy. He pressured us to get in his car, tried to intimidate us with Toronto slang and act gangster, and followed us until we found safety. Security wouldn’t help, but we eventually got away. Be cautious, trust your instincts, and stay safe in downtown Toronto!

Feel free to share this with friends who hang out downtown. If anyone’s had a similar experience, please comment—it’d be helpful to know if this guy has approached others.

The city bus rolled to a stop, its brakes hissing as Steven stepped off into the quaint charm of Seal Beach. The air was tinged with salt and the faint scent of sunscreen, even in January. It was the kind of oceanside town that felt like a gentle exhale after the hustle of bigger cities.

He made his way down Main Street, where colorful storefronts and cozy cafes lined the road. Locals strolled leisurely, some carrying surfboards, others holding steaming cups of coffee. Steven smiled, the laid-back vibe reminding him why he loved California’s coastline.

At the end of the street, the Seal Beach Pier stretched out into the Pacific, a beacon of weathered wood and salty history. He adjusted his camera and began walking its length.

The waves rolled in rhythm below, surfers carving paths through the frothy peaks. Steven paused, framing a shot of a surfer mid-turn, water spraying like shattered glass in the sunlight. The scene had a cinematic quality, the kind he always sought to capture.

A fisherman stood near the edge of the pier, his line cast far into the ocean. Steven struck up a conversation, learning the man’s name was Hector, a retired navy sailor who came to the pier every morning. “Keeps the soul young,” Hector said, holding up his latest catch. Steven clicked his camera, immortalizing the moment.

As the afternoon waned, Steven found a bench and sat, watching the sun sink lower. Gulls cawed overhead, and the ocean’s vastness seemed to stretch endlessly.

For Steven, this small town with its serene pier and vibrant surf culture was another glimpse into California’s soul. Another story etched in light and shadow, another day to remind him why he chased moments like these.

Playing it on 3DS, have it mapped to dual analog, which has its plusses and minuses (mostly not having to use a stylus).

1) Feeling a strange mix of ""I'm amazed they were able to make this as good at is for the system it's on"" and ""I don't know how good this actually is."" And I'm not sure how much of the latter is ""Maybe I'm not paying proper attention to the game's conveyance,"" because I have had to go to secondary sources for a bit of help. (I'm stunned the game has so few item pickups-- seven E-tanks feels borderline surreal.)

2) The maps of the planets themselves feel satisfyingly designed. I like the portal / docking baby of the Celestial Archives, and how Alinos opens up a little bit more each time I return. The backtracking never feels too annoying.

3) Maybe a stylus would be better for shooting, though, because I struggled at times with aiming. This was manageable in general because enemies didn't hit too hard and stayed in predictable patterns, but it was awfully hard to keep up with, for example, those big eyeball bosses that float around. Again, I think the designers recognized this and tried to mitigate that, whether by making the damage taken pretty minimal, or by giving you lots of drops. But it's the first game I've played since maybe the first game where combat could be frustrating as much as fun.

4) That said, the platforming is smooth as silk, and the morph ball stuff largely works well (I liked a morph ball puzzle on Alinos that involved some arbitrary pistons straight out of *Galaxy Quest*). Shooting mapped to the left trigger plays better than I thought it would. So while the combat can annoy, it hasn't made the game unmanageable. (And anyway, I like *Metroid* games more for the exploratory sequences than for the ""action,"" which can be excellent, for sure; I just like Samus the Archaeologist a bit more than Samus the Killer.)

4) I would buy a book that just consolidated the Alimbic / Chozo / Luminoth lore into a galactic history. Good coffee table material.

I absolutely love museums. I am skipping some that appear to be mostly European focused...I figure I can experience European art and history in Europe, you know?  If I've missed any you think I'd enjoy, I'm all ears. I'm really hoping to see exhibits focused around Asian art, history and culture. 



I love live music and live performance in general.  I have captured two places I don't want to miss on my itinerary, and I'm hoping to just stumble across others in my travels.  I have a bunch pinned on Google maps.  If drag shows are a thing in Tokyo, I would love any recommendations. I am unsure if I want to do a Kabuki show or not...It feels like something I would really dig (elaborate costume design, larger then life performance, very culturally specific to Japan, etc.) but reviews seem pretty luke warm amongst the english speaking crowd. I'll take any insight on this. 



 I am an adventurous eater and not picky. I don't need to visit the best places... I imagine that 9 times out of 10, whatever I end up eating is going to be very good.  The only thing I really want to experience is sushi omakase, which I'm working on reserving and have captured in my itinerary. 

I love video games.  Fromsoftware is my favourite developer, and I'm kind of bummed that they don't appear to have much cultural relevance in Japan. Torchtorch is on my itinerary and I'll be scouring Akihabara for merch. 

I'm not interested in night clubs.  Not interested in Teamlabs.

You buy a cup of coffee from a cute looking cafe on wheel, the owner is away and a friendly girl steps in to make your coffee, free of charge. Two men (one is a cop the other one is a firefighter) are talking about how much their girlfriends mean to them.


You walk around, you see Leak again, Leak tells you his story. 


You walk by an area that seems shady, everyone is super nice, they invite you to sit down and chat. 


Then you hear conversation about secret drug dealing, something about a body.


You go to the only restaurant in town, a bar. Even though there’s only one waitress and nobody in the kitchen, you get your food. Leak goes in the bar and pour you a drink. Again, no charge.


Where’s the chef, you asked. 


He went to build a barn, Leak said.


You laugh so hard that your body hurts, Leak suggests you should go see a doctor. 


You go to the local clinic, receptionist write down your info on a notebook. Then the doctor sees you. Out of network? No problem. You are thinking that’s nice, but he gets a phone call from his wife so he has to leave. The doctor left, the nurse showed up in a dress, she makes sure you are ok, gives you a hug. Then she goes to teach yoga.


You go to the bar to have dinner with Leak. He is worried about your car, offers you a place to stay. An old lady say you can stay with her. The next day you go to the cafe again, people ask you to move here.

We were having a great day- I came home from having dinner with a friend and surprised him with take out. He surprised me by taking the dog out and meeting me on the street, though he was sad he didn't make it fast enough to catch me coming off the train platform. We took a loop around the block, me, him and the dog super happy.

We get home, he tells me to wash up, gets everything ready for me. He restarts the movie he was watching even though we've seen it already, brings me some cookies to snack on. And then... somehow he starts getting agitated, is talking at me about something that bothered him that happened 2 weeks ago and then bam- he pauses the movie and the fight is on because even as I see it coming I'm trying to downplay it. Keep calm. And when we fight, it's never about the issue that originally bothered him- he starts bringing up every single thing that I've ever done wrong. Even that thing from 6 years ago. 2 years ago. 6 months ago. Everything. I can't say anything- this always happens, he is unstoppable with his convictions, when he asks me specific questions like, 'remember this thing you said?' and I say no, he'll spitefully comment 'how convenient.' But it doesn't matter because if I did remember and it's not what he remembers, then he accuses me of rewriting history. The fight's not a fight, more like him wrapping himself in his anger and me, trying to figure out how to deescalate but always failing because I can never follow the script and accept words he wants me to say that's hidden in his brain. I start getting mad because of all the same issues he brings up every time, and I'm trying to be better, but he accuses me of not trying hard or soon enough. I'm in therapy and he throws that back in my face, saying how I use it as a crutch when I say I'm trying to improve. I drink tons of water to ensure I can take bathroom breaks and center myself, because I can't fuck up and start yelling back, I have to be calm. 

It doesn't work all the time, and sometimes I snipe back, usually making it worse: ""When you say things like, 'fuck you,' and 'shut the fuck up,' it's like you hate me."" ""Yeah, I do,"" was his answer, and I think... that's when I broke the first time.

The day before we had a couples counsel session and he went on and on about how he wants to work on this relationship, how he appreciates me and etc., and all I can think, 'what a fucking lie,' as he once again threatens to leave. I stop him from leaving and he tells me he'll leave in a few days and won't be back for months to give us a break. Okay, I said, so tired.

The fight lingers into the next day, he slept on the couch but often does because he has night sweats from his ptsd (but then insinuated that maybe he does that a lot because he doesn't want to sleep with me (I broke, again)), and he gets into bed with me for literally 2 minutes to hold my hand. He asks if we're over and I'm like NO! He gets out, and then comes back in an hour or so later to stand above me, and then starts spouting off over one of our old issues with pure vitriol and I'm like ??? When I get out of bed, he is giving me the silent treatment. I'm still mad and I'm so tired as having always be the one to grovel- I can't remember the last time we had a fight over something I got mad about- and if we did, it 100% turns into him being like, 'oh, you're mad I did this, what about this thing you did to me??' So we spend one whole day in separate rooms, and but made me food because when I'm stressed I don't eat, but feel obligated if he makes it.  He does not, however, make me coffee, which is significant because to a friend he was bragging that even when we're fighting he'll always make me coffee. He's still openly hostile if I try to say anything to him. Day 3, again, no coffee (broken, again), but when I ask, he makes it, ignoring my thank you. He's not raging hostile anymore, but quietly spiteful- when I try to talk to him, he rebuffs me- ""oh, now you care?"" I asked to give him a kiss: ""No."" He's never said no before. I tried to hold his hand- it's limp. I make us a meal and he doesn't have any of it. I'm getting more and more mad and sad at myself at how desperate I'm being. Every time I say I love you, he ignores me. Even after all of our other fights, he'd say it, and he says it so much when we're not fighting. But he doesn't say it back this time.

\*\*Narration (Girl’s Thoughts):\*\**No matter what I do, it’s never enough for them. For my mom, everything I do is a waste of time. My dad... he never even listens. He just... doesn’t get me. I’m just supposed to follow the rules, live the way they want.*

\[Panel 2: The girl pulls a notebook from under her bed. Her handwriting is messy but heartfelt as she writes down her thoughts. She sighs heavily.\]

\*\*Narration (Girl’s Thoughts):\*\**I used to write, back when they didn’t lock my books away. I had dreams. I wanted to be something more... but all I’ve ever been to them is a disappointment.*

\[Panel 3: A flashback panel shows the girl submitting her first story. The scene fades into her parents’ harsh words dismissing her dreams and her giving up writing altogether.\]

**Scene 3: The Boy Discovers Isha’s Story**\[Panel 1: Flashback—Tea is browsing through a dusty corner of a library, bookstore, or attic. He stumbles upon a weathered manuscript with faded handwriting. The title is faint but legible.\]

\*\*Narration (Tea’s Thoughts):\*\**I wasn’t looking for anything special, but then I found it. A story left behind. Forgotten. But something about it felt... alive.*

\[Panel 2: Tea flips through the pages, his eyes widening as he gets immersed. A panel shows tears welling up in his eyes.\]

\*\*Narration (Tea’s Thoughts):\*\**The words were raw, unfinished, but powerful. It was as if the writer had poured their soul into it but couldn’t find the strength to finish.*

\[Panel 3: Tea sits at his desk, the manuscript beside him as he begins sketching ideas for his manga.\]

\*\*Narration (Tea’s Thoughts):\*\**I don’t know who wrote this, but I feel their pain, their hope, their passion. I want to honor that. I want to give their story an ending—a voice that reaches others.*

**Scene 4: The Boy’s Rising Popularity**\[Panel 1: The boy’s manga begins to gain traction online. Readers’ comments and shares appear, showing enthusiasm and support.\]

\*\*Narration (Boy’s Thoughts):\*\**Maybe they didn’t see the value in my story, but it seems others do. My work is connecting with people. For once, I’m not alone.*

\[Panel 2: The boy smiles faintly, his eyes a little brighter. He’s looking at the screen, the comments pouring in with messages like: “This story is real,” “I can relate,” and “Thank you for sharing your truth.”\]

\*\*Narration (Boy’s Thoughts):\*\**It’s not about being accepted by them. It’s about creating for myself. It’s my truth. And that’s enough.*

**Scene 5: The Girl Discovers Tea’s Manga**\[Panel 1: Isha is curled up on her bed with her phone, the glow from the screen illuminating her face. She begins reading Tea’s manga.\]

\*\*Narration (Isha’s Thoughts):\*\**The art... the story... it feels so familiar. Like I’ve seen it somewhere before.*

\[Panel 2: Close-up of Isha’s eyes widening as she gets drawn into the story. The scene transitions into her imagination, showing Sha in a pivotal moment, struggling to write.\]

\*\*Narration (Sha, in Isha’s Imagination):\*\**They’ll never understand me. But maybe... that’s okay. I don’t need their approval.*

\[Panel 3: A side-by-side panel shows Sha writing passionately, juxtaposed with a flashback of Isha setting her pen down years ago.\]

\*\*Narration (Isha’s Thoughts):\*\**This... this is my life. How does he know this? How could someone I’ve never met understand my struggle so deeply?*

**Scene 6: The Twist – Tea’s Inspiration**\[Panel 1: Isha scrolls to the author’s note at the end of the manga, where Tea thanks “a forgotten story” for inspiring him.\]

\*\*Narration (Isha’s Thoughts):\*\**He found it. The story I thought was lost forever. He didn’t just hear me—he believed in me enough to make it his own.*

\[Panel 2: A flashback panel shows Tea discovering Isha’s abandoned story years ago and using it as a foundation for his manga.\]

\*\*Narration (Isha’s Thoughts):\*\**My voice wasn’t lost. He heard me. He gave my story a new life.*

**Scene 7: The Cycle of Inspiration**\[Panel 1: Isha reflects on the line from Tea’s manga: “I create for myself, because my worth isn’t defined by others’ opinions.” She writes it down in her notebook, her hand steady and determined.\]

\*\*Narration (Isha’s Thoughts):\*\**His story... my story... it reached so many people. It’s given me hope. It’s reminded me that my voice matters, even when I thought it didn’t.*

\[Panel 2: Cut to Tea at his desk, reading Isha’s heartfelt comment on his manga: “Thank you for reminding me who I am.” His eyes light up with recognition.\]

\*\*Narration (Tea’s Thoughts):\*\**Her voice inspired me when I was lost. And now, my work has inspired her. It’s come full circle.*

\[Panel 3: A split-screen panel shows Tea drawing a new page and Isha writing in her notebook. Both are smiling faintly, their actions mirroring each other’s determination.\]

\*\*Narration (Isha and Tea, Simultaneously):\*\**I create for myself, because my worth isn’t defined by others’ opinions.*

\[Panel 4: Both the boy and the girl, though miles apart, find themselves taking the first steps toward healing. The weight of rejection, family trauma, and self-doubt still linger—but now, they’re not as heavy. There is hope, there is purpose, and there is the freedom to create their own paths.\]

**Narration (Closing Line):** *""Every story has its roots, and every voice, no matter how faint, leaves an echo. In the spaces between rejection and recognition, pain and hope, lies the power to create, to connect, and to inspire.""*

\[End of Chapter.\]

**""Based on real events.""**

*There is a girl who lived through all the trauma you’ve seen. A girl who had her voice silenced, her dreams forgotten. And there is a boy who wrote her story, not knowing it would reach her. Maybe you're just looking at his work, but in the spaces between the ink and pages, there's more than just fiction. There's a truth, a voice, and a journey that was never meant to be lost.*

# The Surprise Extra Page

1. ***Scene Setup***
   * *The page begins with Tea standing on a brightly lit stage, holding an award, looking humble yet proud. He’s clearly overwhelmed but at peace, finally valued for who he truly is.*
   * *The audience is clapping, some standing in applause, but the focus shifts subtly to someone sitting quietly in the crowd.*
2. ***The Mystery Girl***
   * *The girl's face is hidden, either by her hair, shadows, or the angle of the scene.*
   * *She’s holding a diary on her lap. The diary is distinctive, matching the one Isha had in the main story.*
3. ***Visual Emphasis***
   * *The panel zooms in on the diary, showing small details that confirm it’s Isha’s without explicitly stating it.*
   * *A subtle hint—like a faint, barely visible name or the unique pattern of the cover—can add intrigue.*
4. ***Final Panel***
   * *The girl sits silently, watching Tea with a small, mysterious smile or calm expression.*
   * *The last frame is either a close-up of the diary or her hand gripping it gently, leaving readers questioning her identity.*",1,1736732434.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False
1i02vqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1i02vqs/34_m4f_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection/, 34 [M4F] - Longing for intense and deep connection and seeking the casual chat that leads to it ,"Hello!

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity. While we're on the topic, since it fits better here than in most spots, I don't do the politics thing. If it's a requirement of yours that someone shares your exact political, cultural, or personal values, we should discuss it bluntly and quickly to see if something is possible between us. No 'side' or 'sphere' is one I relate all that much to and I have contentions with all of them.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1736732419.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

But that's not how it's supposed to be, and chances are, you already know that. Yet I've not seen any proper networking events happening around, when they happen abroad all too often. 

As a founder, you might want other successful friends, you might need help and guidance from other people who share a similar goal, or you might want to help others because it fulfills you to see other people grow.

If you understand what I'm talking about, and you're a Business Owner/ Founder/ CEO who's looking to network with other like-minded individuals from the twin cities, then read on. But if you're still confused and can't relate, then it's just not for you.

So the goal is to collectively uplift the business fraternity of the twin cities. For that, we're starting a series of weekly networking meetups with the first one being next week, where we will not only be in the company of other capable people with high goals, but also maybe make friends that could help eachother along the way in different areas.

Our meetups will be in a cafe / coffee shop that shall be disclosed only to the people that are verified. This is only for the folks in the Twin Cities (Rawalpindi & Islamabad), and here's how you can join.

To be a part, [join the WhatsApp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/CxH4NoHVb8mEoD5RatkByS), and then fill out the form which will be shared in the group. The form will be a short vetting process that allows me to maintain the quality of our group.

a) are a Business Owner/ Founder/ CEO
b) have employee(s)
c) are already generating revenue

1i02rq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i02rq1/synchronicity/,Synchronicity,"James Cavendish looked across his desk at his visitor with a level gaze. The blublphllt looked like a frog crossed with a blowfish, but uglier. Alien body language was sometimes hard to read, but he was pretty sure Ambassador Glpltd was glaring at him.

“Thank you for coming, Ambassador. Tea?” he offered.

Glpltd burbled a short response, sounding like someone blowing bubbles in something thick and viscous. Yogurt, maybe. “No,” the translator device on his desk said a moment later.

“All right. Water? Coffee? My attendant baked some scones earli–”

More yogurt bubbles. “No. You will attend the point of this meeting immediately or I will leave.”

Rude. But so be it.

“All right.” James leaned back in his very comfortable chair. It had been brought to the galactic capital at enormous expense. He considered it worth every penny.  “You have accused humanity of espionage, over some leaked video of us swimming.”

Burble. “Yes. And I presume that you will deny it, despite its obvious veracity.”

Leave it to a translator to use a word like *veracity,* James thought. “Yes. We do.”

“Humanity is not an aquatic species,” Glpltd plorbed. He paused after each sentence to let the translator do its work. “Even being in water is unnatural. But this ‘synchronized swimming’ is clearly a training technique. That is the only purpose possible. The similarity to our own dgltptth technique only helps stick our assertions in the mud.”

It took James a moment to realize the translator had perhaps taken a blublphllt saying too literally. And another for him to figure out it probably was roughly equal to *cement my case.* “To the contrary, there is another reason. Art.”

“You claim this is art? There is no manual visual recording being made.”

Damn translator.  This was probably natural when a species is new to galactic diplomacy, like humanity. But that didn't make it any less annoying. “Tell me, Ambassador: do your people not dance?”

“Of course. It is the primary way to gain the attention of a potential mate.” Glpltd leveled a short, stubby arm James' way accusingly. “But you do not do such things. You are new here, but that much is known already. Your people do not court this way.”

James considered briefly telling Glpltd about proms and nightclubs, but decided that would take too long. Way too long. “Not entirely true,” he said, instead. “But, not entirely false, I’ll grant you.”

“Then I remain unconvinced. We shall continue to call for sanctions against humanity.”

James was a good ambassador. That's why he’d been assigned here, after all. So he didn't wince at the thought of all the lucrative trade deals humanity had made since First Contact suddenly evaporating. Billions of dollars would vanish overnight. Companies would be ruined. The stock market would tank. It wasn’t impossible sanctions might spark political unrest, if they were severe enough.

Sanctions would be *bad.*

“Ambassador Glpltd,” James said levelly, “please, tell me: how long has humanity been a member of galactic society?”

Glpltd blinked slowly, clearly unsure why his counterpart was asking a question he surely knew the answer to. “Four years,” he glubbed after a moment.

“Yes. Well, three years, as we consider them. But my point is, First Contact was very recent, would you not agree?”

“Yes.”

James pressed a few buttons, and the wall display changed from a mural to a video. On it could be seen a pair of swimmers performing a routine in front of a crowd in perfect synchrony.

“This is Emma Orton and Laura Waltony. They won the gold medal for synchronized swimming at the last Olympic Games.”

Glpltd stared at the screen and blorped, “When were these… games?”

 ""Two years ago. But–”  

 ""You admit it!” Glpltd's noises were distressingly loud.  And kind of disgusting. “Your perfidity goes back so far! Nearly to First Contact!”

 “Before First Contact, actually. *Well* before.” James pressed the button again, pulling up a new pair of swimmers, in a different pool. And again. And again. “I'm willing to pay for an investigative team of your choosing to visit our homeworld and examine our records. The earliest ones are physical, not digital. Their age cannot be faked.”

 “I do not think we will accept your... generous offer,” the blublphllt plooped. “These waters smell of deceit. Even physical records can be falsified, with enough time and money.”

 “You think so? Well, possibly."" James stopped changing the images, leaving the display showing a grainy, black-and-white video of two figures moving together in the water. ""But other races will come. And once they've verified the ages of our records, if you still insist we stole your techniques, things will go badly for you.”

“Are you threatening us?”

“Not at all!” James held up his hands in what he hoped Glpltd recognized as a placating gesture. Threatening the race that owned the third-largest fleet of military starships would *also* be bad. “But consider. If we stole those moves from you, and those records are genuine – which they are – then it means we met you long before official First Contact.”  James leaned forward and looked intently at his opposite. “So tell me, Abassador: what *is* the penalty for contacting a pre-spaceflight species? Without authorization. And not informing the rest of the Council. Because if your accusation is true, then so must that one be.”

It was less than a minute later that Glpltd was hastily leaving James' office, glubbing loud apologies and promising to quench his government's ire.

James sighed and relaxed. He let himself savor the victory for a moment before summoning his assistant. “Have that couch cleaned.  Maybe the entire office. The place stinks of fish and mud, now.”

“Certainly, sir,” Piotr said, making notes on his tablet. “I can have them in tonight.”

“Good. And get word to those damn SpecOps back home. They need to be more careful of the videos they put online. No more showing off how good we are at alien training techniques on TikTok!”",9,1736732069.0,HFY,3,0.8,False

1i02mb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1i02mb7/a_dying_empire_the_trial_of_devotion/,A dying empire: the trial of devotion.,"Esten’s heart beat ragged though the fanfare had yet to break the silence of the arena. Bear stood next to him, glancing down with a smile and speaking in a deep heavy voice. His accent still thick despite his years of service before he became a Hand of the Emperor, and the generation of service as one. “Ye got nutin to werry bout lad.” words like a rich deep coffee allowed only to the highest officers. “Even if yer a twig i cen narry lad a hand on ye in train, ye gonna be fine.”

“Bear everyones a twig to you.” Esten said with a smile and a gentle nudge, drawing a hearty laugh from the giant of a man. It was true standing next to the man Esten looked nearly like a child. Though he was a far cry from the emaciated slave he had been three years ago, before the trial of the relics and starting his training to serve as a hand of the Emperor, Bear stood larger than a Red Mountain Regiment marines armor. He had been attached to them for that very purpose, a hand needs to fit the arm it's attached too.

Esten remembered the words of Bishop Jarume all too well, the man's tutelage had been brutal in his initial training, but he had always been fair. Esten thought it strange that he didn't miss the man, that seeing his head blown open by an elven arrow hadn’t bothered him. He always wondered if that was an effect of the Relics swimming in his blood, or if he had simply grown callus in the life he had lived.

“He’s not wrong, Bear.” Specter's voice came from the air on the other side of Esten before his body materialized into view. The man's sharp features were always off putting when he did that, even in the year he had been on loan from the Amethyst Gale Regiment to train Esten in infiltration and reconnaissance tactics he hadn’t grown used to him materializing from thin air. “Course would be easier if you could hide your presence fully, but the relics bless us all in different ways.” Specter said with a smile, turning his hand over and looking at his nails. “I'm still not sure why on earth so much effort has been put into training you Sage, your blessing seems useless.”

“Specter, dunt be an arse.” Bear growled. Specter responded something but Esten paid no mind. He quickly checked his twin pistols hanging under each arm, then the knife tied around his leg, and finally the long thin elven sword he wore across his back. He had taken the sword in conquest in his first battle, the sleek black blade looked as though it would make a fine trophy, but he had never been able to find anything that cut quite like it. He adjusted the sleek armored jacket underneath the leather holsters, making sure the gig line was straight. Each of the Hands uniforms were slightly different. Specters jacket long and hooded, Bears more a vest that showed his arms thick as a Vankta who would crush its prey before swallowing it whole. Estens was more like an officers dress uniform, two rows of shiny silver buttons adorned the front, a stark contrast to the deep black of the jacket. A high collar, a red lining around each cuff, sleek black trousers tucked into the fine Dolor skin boots. The Ancients relic of armored fabric ran though the whole of his uniform, but he had refined it somewhat to be stronger. An action that would have him branded a heretic were he not chosen as the sage by the relics. He brushed absently at the golden insignia of the black dawn stitched into his left sleeve, a setting sun. 

“Hey are you listening to me?” he heard specter ask as the man struck towards the back of his head. He ducked, letting the blow pass him by and straightened a mischievous grin on his face.

“No I wasn't Specter, there are a great many things i find far more useful than listening to you. Like watching paint dry for instance.” Esten jested, seeing ire grow on the mans face. He watched as Specter almost instinctively touched the shackles around his wrists. Those were uncommon for a hand, a constant reminder not only to Specter but to all others that even though he was a Hand he had been selected for the trial of relics from prison. He always played at them when he felt disrespected, and there was something like a twinge of sadness within Esten seeing the subtle show of the man's insecurity.

“Do you know why we were honored with the trial of relics?” Esten asked absentmindedly, touching the tattoo on his left wrist that showed all he had been a slave belonging to the college of relics. He watched as Specter balked for a moment, suddenly aware it was something he had never thought about.

The sound of trumpets cut off all conversation and thought as the three men stiffened to attention. the sound of hundreds of marines armor moving to a standing position at once not even drowning out the fan fair for a moment. Then silence, an uneasy thing. Broken by the soft brush of a robe along the ground in the distance. Esten couldn’t see it but he knew the Emporer had arrived, was taking a podium across the arena and would call for the festivities to start. 

“Welcome friends, life of our glorious empire.” the mans voice was soft and kind, not at all what Esten would have expected, and the words drew a roar of praise from the nobles of the nearby planets gathered in the thousands. The few hundred peasants who were lucky enough to be in attendance seemed to cheer even more raukessly than the nobles. As if they may change their lives by a moment of fevered worship. The crowd grew quiet and Esten knew the emperor had raised his hands.

“Today we pay witness to the glory of my Hands, as the latest is ready to be tested.” a pause for a moment of more cheers and applause. “Then we shall feast, and celebrate the world over. Each man shall receive a full day's wage for each of the three days we shall celebrate our empire.” Esten could feel the tone of the room shift, the nobles unaware of this coming command suddenly finding their credit accounts taxed and returned to their serfs. He couldn't help but smile, Bear openly chuckled. Something if any noble saw them do would have meant death were it not for their station.

“For it is you, the working man of this empire who is its life blood. Nobody can survive with weak blood! The Marines who serve to cure the universe of the disease of the coalition, those foul orcs, elves, and others who stand against the glory of the human empire. The farmers who feed all the empire, the miners who draw minerals from the planets we lay righteous claim to! For my hands cannot shape this universe without each and every one of you who keeps the body of the empire alive!” The man spoke with pride and power in every word. Esten could practically feel the patriotic fervor of the presents who screamed in awe and gratitude for the Emperor.

The gate before the three men began to rise, and Esten could finally see the red dirt floor of the grand imperial arena, the seats packed full with men and women in every bit of finery they owned in the lower stands. Above them marines in various armors, each painted with different colors and symbols he couldn't make out clearly. And above them the private boxes that held the highest ranking of nobles in the empire. Directly across from the gate, near the middle of the arena walls that stretched so high Esten couldn't even guess from the sun's position what time it was, jutted out the cubiculum, great red banners hanging from it that almost reached the dirt floor bearing the imperial seal. A large closed fist, steaks of silver escaping in the gaps between the fingers and thumb. The hand that had gripped the stars.

“I call upon my hands!” the Emperors voice boomed over the croud. Bear went first, charging though the still half opened gate, ripping it from the wall with a great clatter, before slamming his fists upon the ground to send a smattering of dirt into the air. 

“Remember Sage. Put on a show.” Specter said with a mischievous smile before moving though the gate when bear had reached near center of the arena. He stepped into view of the crowd only for an instant before vanishing into the air. Reappearing in the stands next to a young woman, a rose held out in his hand. Just as quickly as he had appeared he vanished again, before reappearing far enough along the arena floor that Esten knew it was his time to move. He stepped calmly and gracefully into the arena, the cheers of the crowd filling his ears with a glory that warmed his soul. He glanced around before moving quickly, striding across the arena floor until he stood before the rows filled with the few peasants lucky enough to be in attendance. He placed his right hand to his chest and bowed deeply. A hush swept across the crowd like a ghost had walked though every man, woman, and child. He held the bow for a moment before he heard a chuckle from the cubiculum he knew to be the emperors, he lifted his head and moved so he was more clearly facing the marines, and put his right fist to his chest in salute.

A soft clap, like the striking of a match before it touched to a powder keg and the room was rocked by a million explosions, cheers so loud they nearly deafened Esten. He broke the salute, turned, and walked to stand between Bear and Specter.

“Fuck lad yer lucky he liked that. Culda get us killed.” Bear hissed at him under his breath, but Esten merely smiled in response.

A single hand raised from the emperor and the thousands of people in the room went silent in an instant. The three men immediately put their hands to their hearts and bowed deeply, each taking a knee to the ground and lowering their heads. But it wasn't the emperor voice they heard first. Instead it was one Esten recognized, just as he recognized the beating in his heart from the fear it brought. “Emperor, i would ask that you.” Esten couldn’t see what happened, he knew the old priest was whispering, and the Emperor had cut him off.

“Sage, wisest of my hands, has seen fit to follow the directive of his Emperor in his first appearance. To show today honor to those who are most important to our Empire, by bowing first to the working men and women, then saluting those who fight for our glory. Even in his first moment to appear in glory before the empire he shows the wisdom to humble himself and act in his duty, being a hand of the Emperor means carrying out his will. Before it has even begun the trial of devotion has been passed.” The booming voice of the Emperor seemed to be filled with mirth and pride. The instant the words left his mouth the room exploded in cheers so loud Esten could feel the ground shake under their vibrations. He kept his head trained towards the ground but could see specter mouth profanities from the corner of his eye.

The crowd grew silent again, and Esten knew the Emperor had raised a hand to continue the ceremony. “Even though Sage has already proven his devotion, i still enjoy the ceremony, and im sure well all enjoy the show, so please good people humor me.” he paused for a moment allowing the crowd to laugh. Esten was somewhat shocked the Emperor seemed to have such a kind sense of humor. “Bear, strongest of my hands, have you taught Sage everything he must know?”

Esten saw the man to his right raise his head before he spoke. “Your illustrious grace,” the man was straining with every bit of might he had not to let his accent slip out. “I fear i have failed you, i came hear to teach, but i have learned far more from the Sage then i could ever impart.”

“Does he have the strength to use his wisdom in devoted service to the Empire, to protect it even from itself?” The emperor responded, continuing the ceremony's progression.

“He has the strength to grip the light from a star. As each of your hands can.” Bear responded. Esten could hear the man's heart beating so fast he began to worry about him, the fear of letting his accent slip in the ceremony was evident.

“Spector, oldest of my hands, have you taught Sage all you would have hoped to learn?” The voice boomed again and Bear lowered his head back into the deep formal bow as Specter raised his.

“Your magnificence, i'm afraid i failed you as well, he’s far too wise to ever make most of my mistakes, and had received tutelage to grow beyond error from the staff of many priests long before he was given to the trials of the relics.” Specter almost laughed as he said the words.

Esten’s breath caught in his chest, criticizing the church was a one way ticket to a dishonorable grave even for a noble. Were the hands in such a position that there station could engage in open sacrilege? Or would this be seen by the emperor as praise to the priests. The men had told him of the ceremony loosely but not exactly what would be said. He was drawn from his thoughts and his fear by the emperors voice.

“Will he be another mistake for you to learn from?” the emperor asked calmly, Esten felt the relife wash over him as the ceremony continued forward. No one seemed to have reacted to what was said about the beatings he had received.

“In honesty your grace, he'll probably be the one you send to put me down when you finally tire of my service.” Specter laughed as he finished the sentence, both Esten and Bear stiffened, ready to move in an instant. That definitely wasn't part of the ceremony, had Specter grown tired of living? Was he trying to get the emperor to order his death? The instant stretched on longer than any seemed like it could while Esten ran every calculation of movement Specter may make, how to counter any blow, any movement he could make to strike, how Spector would respond.

And then the instant passed, Esten felt his body soften as he heard the Emperor laugh. “Rise now Sage, and stand ready for a final trial. A trial of devotion, you will be tested in every capability, tested to act as my hands should.”

Esten rose to his feat, raising his head to the Emperor, setting eyes on the man for the first time. He was shorter than Esten had expected, standing perhaps the same height as Esten himself, his dark black hair framed his face in curly locks as the crown of bone and gold sat perched atop his head, his close black beard giving a dignified air. Aside from that and the long black and red robe that hung around his shoulders his clothes looked no finer than any Esten would have worn during training, a simple black tunic and trousers. If he discarded the crown, and the robe he could have slipped into a crowd and vanished in an instant. Perhaps that was the point all along.

Esten didn't have long to ponder as the sharp creak and grind of another gate began. He heard the shuffle of Spector and Bears boots along the sand floor of the arena, quickly moving back towards the gate they had come in. He heard the tell tale sign of a rifle cocking from where the gate had lifted to his left.

He spun, using his foot to kick up sand before diving to the right, feeling the heat of a plasma round round pass though the air where his chest would have been a moment before as he pulled the pistol from the holster under his left arm, quickly training it in the direction of the rifle sound and firing. The pistol kicked in his hand, ejecting the casing as it belched fire and lead. The relic was so ancient even the college of relics had questioned why he requisitioned it as a tool. He had spend countless hours shaping and forging each little part it needed to function again, and countless more building what he needed to to shape near useless scrap metal into rounds for it.

A shatter filled the air as the round connected with the helmet of the marine who was testing him. Followed by a gasp from each marine in the crowd as the heavy thing fell into pieces off the Witch Hunters head. Esten moved towards her as quickly as he could, hoping he could get next to her before the daze from the shock wore off. His boots pounded and twisted in the sand, his knife nearly springing into his left hand as he ducked under the rifle and slashed upwards though the tube in the left armpit of the armor, moving this time not to be sprayed in the face by the hot fluid as he heard the armor begin to groan, the Marines knees give out under its now unsupported weight and collapse to the ground as he took a position behind her and placed the knife at the nape of her neck.

“Its been almost 3 years to the day since the last time we were in this position Tan.” He whispered as the tip of the blade bit though the leather, chewing into the slight scar between the vertebrae. He glanced up quickly at the Emperor before a thought crossed his mind.

“You win again Sage.” the Witch Hunter growled. “Send me to an honorable grave then.”

Esten withdrew the knife and stepped around to face her, quickly holstering his pistol and switching the knife to his right hand. He could hear the beating of her heart, only this time it didnt pound with fear, it held steady and the thumping of the pistons as they drove the engine of the Black Dawns Galactus class forward though the black sea. He couldn't help but smile as he looked down at her. He knew somehow diying at his hands was an outcome she wasnt afraid of.

He quickly placed the hilt of the knife against his right shoulder, blade facing outwards to her as he striaghteded to a position of attention, sliding his left hand behind his back in a salute reserved for officers. “Witch Hunter Tenniset, your efforts in creating and expanding the field repair training program, in coordinating with the college of relics to ensure the veneration of each relic undergoing field repair, and your constant effort to ensure all relics entrusted to the Black Dawn are well maintained shows devotion to the Empire. Today i salute you, as an honor to your ancestors, an honor to the black dawn, an honor to the empire, and an honor to the ancients.”

An orbital bombardment might have well been dropped directly on the arena for all the noise the cheering of the crowd made. Even the emperor rose to his feet and clapped boldly. All across the many worlds of the human empire where screens played in small villages with huts made of dirt and stone along farms, shacks of little more than twigs peasants called home, people cheered. So loudly the coalition grew nervous, suspicious of the humans progress once more.
Esten knew little of this beyond the roar of the crowd in the arena, and the smile of the woman he had come to know in his last three years in training with the Black Dawn as a steadfast friend.

As suddenly as it had erupted the croud grew silent, as the emperor made his way down the stairs of the cubiculum onto the red sand floor of the arena, his great black and red cape dragging across it. Esten broke his salute and moved quickly to take a knee and bow deeply. The emperors voice boomed across the arena as he grew closer to the man and the collapsed witch hunter. “Sage Wisest of my hands, honors those I want honored for service that strengthens the empire.” He said, pulling a rod with a symbol of crossed keys on its end from within his robe and pressing a button on the side. Even as he spoke it began to heat, Esten could smell the Iron growing red hot. “Hold out your hand Sage, so you may be marked with the honor you have earned.”

Esten dropped his knife in the dirt, holding out his right hand, his head still bowed. His flesh began to sizzle the instant the emperor pressed the branding iron hard into his palm. Holding it long enough so even with the healing the relics gave him he would hold the scar for all his life. The crossed keys of the kingdom, the seal of the emperor that made any decree or law official. He smelled his own flesh burning, but felt no pain. Only joy and pride as the sizzling of the flesh grew slower.

“Now rise, and look me in the eye.” The emperors voice boomed across the arena. Estin did what he was told, looking deeply into the mans soft green eyes. Something about it felt like blasphemy in and of itself, but he did as he was told as the emperor reached out and grabbed his arm at the elbow. He returned the gesture and saw the man break into a wide smile.

“You have no idea how much good will you’ve just bought me from the people. Even the nobles will stop hounding me to produce an heir for at least a week. Bloody brilliant Sage.” the emperor whispered to him. The informal tone took him immediately by surprise, and he did his best to keep his mouth from falling open. “Oh don't look so surprised, im just a person in the end, and the hands are the one group of people in this bloody empire i can talk to like they are people, since technically your a direct extension of my body now, when i talk to you im really just talking to myself.”

The emperor did the unthinkable then, he winked and grinned somewhat mischievously at sage. Sage knew there were relics all around taking in every bit of the image, but somehow knew they didn't catch that. That to the public the emperor must remain the divine will of the ancients placed in the verse to lead humanity to glory. “Come Sage, we must go gather with the other hands to sit for a new official portrait. It takes ages for these fools to put paint to canvas to capture our pictures, but all my advisors say its needed. And itll be a nice time for us to talk and for you to meet the other two of my hands.”

The emperor broke the handshake and turned walking towards the gate of the arena the Witch hunter had emerged from, even as a Black Dawn recovery unit scurried around the Witch Hunter, breaking her out of her armor as quickly and safely as they could.

Esten followed quickly behind the emperor, trying his best to follow at a respectful pace and distance.”That was truly incredible Sage, the way you played of my message to the working class to placate them, helped the marines feel honored to keep them in line. And those weapons you carry, ive never seen anything like it what even are those things?”

“Uhh thank you your grace.” Esten began to respond only to be cut off by a groan from the emperor.

“Ehhhh it’s always your grace this, your eminence that, your devine presence of the ancients the other. My name is barry!” the emperor whined. It was a strange juxtaposition to the regal man he had seen in the arena less than moments before.

“Berry?” Esten couldn’t help himself, as he laughed. It was all just so strange.

“Well technically Markus Barthalemew Sunder Titus VIII. But my mother always called me Berry, i quite liked my mother, and i like the name she chose for me.” The man said, undoing his great cape and gathering it up in his arms. “This thing is such a chore to wear.” he said somewhat abesntly before continuing. “Did you like you mother sage?” he asked almost carelessly as he made his way into the bowels of the imperial arena.

“I dont rightly remember her much, i was four when she sold me.” Esten responded flatly. It wasnt that it was something that upset him to think about, he just didnt care much about it in the end.

“Ah right the slave trade…” Berry said pausing for a moment. “I tried to end it once you know? That did not go over well, so many nobles were so furious when i even floated the idea i had to have Specter stay in my room every night watching over me for asassination attempts for a full year.” he chuckled as if reliving a fond memory. “Of course i was 14 at the time, and did not consider the consequences for my actions. Sometimes he still reminds me of that. Oh but you were to tell me of the weapons you carry. what are they! How can break a marines helmet!” he said the last as if he had suddenly stumbled upon some long forgotten treasure.

“They’re relics from mother world. They use shaped projectiles like the capital rail guns just on a much smaller scale, propelling them forward with the force of a black powder explosion. I had to study several holy texts to develop the capabilities to forge the parts for them, but the college of literature, and the college of craftsmen were all to happy to help. An idiots guide to watch making came in rather handy believe it or not.” Esten responded excitedly. Pulling one of the pistols from its holster and pressing the button on the side to remove the magazine, before pulling back the slide to eject the bullet in the chamber. He held it out in offering to the Emperor. “It was called a 1911 by the ancients if im not mistaken, but they had several thousand shapes and forms of pistol so i'm not certain.”

“Fascinating.” Berry whistled as he took the pistol from the Estens hand. He quickly dropped into a mock battle stance and pointed the pistol at the wall pulling the trigger as he did. “Bang! Bang! Bang!” he said the weapon clicked in his hand. “Why isnt it working?” he looked like a disappointed child, turning it over in his hands.

“I unloaded it.” Esten responded holding up the magazine. “Each pull of that trigger sends a round into whatever its pointed at, as such i felt it was best to remove the rounds until such a time that you could safely use it.”

“Already protecting the empire from itself. I like it.” Berry said excitedly, tossing the pistol over his shoulder back towards Esten as he began to climb the stairs in the back of the arena. “This is technically a secret route into my private on site quarters, the painter is waiting in my sitting room with the other hands by now.” He said somewhat absent mindedly as he began to climb.

It wasnt long before they entered into a room, bear and specter both sat eating and drinking heartily, beside them a woman with long white hair, and a black cloak that reached almost to the floor, and a man standing in the corner peeing into a plant.

Today my other friend who I haven't seen in a while and has never been to the coffee shop with me noticed for me that the really cute barista that always works Sundays was giving me ""the looks"" - women you apparenlyy know what those are... I as a man don't know lol. I got a second confirmation from my friend who I usually see who joined us today. Both friends are women and both agree she's showing interest in me... 

I haven't tried flirting with her because 1) dude, in this crazy society for a man to be flirting with a barista? Yeah no, so not up for opening any of those doors. 2) I think I've just not bothered looking for any of those signs since COVID and the lack of organic meeting/interest qhstever you want to call it. And 3)... Tbh idk how to flirt anymore. I was apparently good at it when I was a teenager, or at least I was intentionally charming... But as a grown man? Hell idk man. Maybe I'm just still stuck in pandemic lockdown mode where I'm afraid to try anything out of my comfort zone. 

Thoughts? I know I'm overthinking it. But I legit just don't know what to say...

**Boy: Tea**

**Girl: Isha**

**Girl in manga: Sha**

**Scene 1: The Boy's Rejection**\[Panel 1: A dimly lit room filled with crumpled paper and empty coffee cups. The boy, in his early twenties, sits at his desk, staring at his laptop screen. His manga submission has been rejected. A letter with a red “REJECTED” stamp lies on the desk.\]

**Narration (Boy’s Thoughts):***Another rejection. It’s the same story every time. They think I’m not good enough. They don’t understand my story, my passion... but maybe they’re right. Maybe I’ll never be able to make it.*

\[Panel 2: The boy leans back in his chair, defeated. A gentle light comes from the laptop screen as he opens his manga files.\]

**Narration (Boy’s Thoughts):***But... maybe I don’t need them. Maybe I can find my own way, even if no one else believes in me.*

\[Panel 3: The boy, still looking defeated, begins uploading his manga online to a platform, hitting the “publish” button.\]





**Scene 2: The Girl’s Struggles**\[Panel 1: A small room in a house filled with textbooks, journals, and old family photos. The girl, in her early twenties, sits on the edge of her bed, staring at the wall. She looks tired, her face a mix of frustration and sorrow.\]

**Narration (Girl’s Thoughts):***No matter what I do, it’s never enough for them. For my mom, everything I do is a waste of time. My dad... he never even listens. He just... doesn’t get me. I’m just supposed to follow the rules, live the way they want.*

\[Panel 2: The girl pulls a notebook from under her bed. Her handwriting is messy but heartfelt as she writes down her thoughts. She sighs heavily.\]

**Narration (Girl’s Thoughts):***I used to write, back when they didn’t lock my books away. I had dreams. I wanted to be something more... but all I’ve ever been to them is a disappointment.*

\[Panel 3: A flashback panel shows the girl submitting her first story. The scene fades into her parents’ harsh words dismissing her dreams and her giving up writing altogether.\]





**Scene 3: The Boy Discovers Isha’s Story**\[Panel 1: Flashback—Tea is browsing through a dusty corner of a library, bookstore, or attic. He stumbles upon a weathered manuscript with faded handwriting. The title is faint but legible.\]

**Narration (Tea’s Thoughts):***I wasn’t looking for anything special, but then I found it. A story left behind. Forgotten. But something about it felt... alive.*

\[Panel 2: Tea flips through the pages, his eyes widening as he gets immersed. A panel shows tears welling up in his eyes.\]

**Narration (Tea’s Thoughts):***The words were raw, unfinished, but powerful. It was as if the writer had poured their soul into it but couldn’t find the strength to finish.*

\[Panel 3: Tea sits at his desk, the manuscript beside him as he begins sketching ideas for his manga.\]

**Narration (Tea’s Thoughts):***I don’t know who wrote this, but I feel their pain, their hope, their passion. I want to honor that. I want to give their story an ending—a voice that reaches others.*





**Scene 4: The Boy’s Rising Popularity**\[Panel 1: The boy’s manga begins to gain traction online. Readers’ comments and shares appear, showing enthusiasm and support.\]

**Narration (Boy’s Thoughts):***Maybe they didn’t see the value in my story, but it seems others do. My work is connecting with people. For once, I’m not alone.*

\[Panel 2: The boy smiles faintly, his eyes a little brighter. He’s looking at the screen, the comments pouring in with messages like: “This story is real,” “I can relate,” and “Thank you for sharing your truth.”\]

**Narration (Boy’s Thoughts):***It’s not about being accepted by them. It’s about creating for myself. It’s my truth. And that’s enough.*





**Scene 5: The Girl Discovers Tea’s Manga**\[Panel 1: Isha is curled up on her bed with her phone, the glow from the screen illuminating her face. She begins reading Tea’s manga.\]

**Narration (Isha’s Thoughts):***The art... the story... it feels so familiar. Like I’ve seen it somewhere before.*

\[Panel 2: Close-up of Isha’s eyes widening as she gets drawn into the story. The scene transitions into her imagination, showing Sha in a pivotal moment, struggling to write.\]

**Narration (Sha, in Isha’s Imagination):***They’ll never understand me. But maybe... that’s okay. I don’t need their approval.*

\[Panel 3: A side-by-side panel shows Sha writing passionately, juxtaposed with a flashback of Isha setting her pen down years ago.\]

**Narration (Isha’s Thoughts):***This... this is my life. How does he know this? How could someone I’ve never met understand my struggle so deeply?*





**Scene 6: The Twist – Tea’s Inspiration**\[Panel 1: Isha scrolls to the author’s note at the end of the manga, where Tea thanks “a forgotten story” for inspiring him.\]

**Narration (Isha’s Thoughts):***He found it. The story I thought was lost forever. He didn’t just hear me—he believed in me enough to make it his own.*

\[Panel 2: A flashback panel shows Tea discovering Isha’s abandoned story years ago and using it as a foundation for his manga.\]

**Narration (Isha’s Thoughts):***My voice wasn’t lost. He heard me. He gave my story a new life.*





**Scene 7: The Cycle of Inspiration**\[Panel 1: Isha reflects on the line from Tea’s manga: “I create for myself, because my worth isn’t defined by others’ opinions.” She writes it down in her notebook, her hand steady and determined.\]

**Narration (Isha’s Thoughts):***His story... my story... it reached so many people. It’s given me hope. It’s reminded me that my voice matters, even when I thought it didn’t.*

\[Panel 2: Cut to Tea at his desk, reading Isha’s heartfelt comment on his manga: “Thank you for reminding me who I am.” His eyes light up with recognition.\]

**Narration (Tea’s Thoughts):***Her voice inspired me when I was lost. And now, my work has inspired her. It’s come full circle.*

\[Panel 3: A split-screen panel shows Tea drawing a new page and Isha writing in her notebook. Both are smiling faintly, their actions mirroring each other’s determination.\]

**Narration (Isha and Tea, Simultaneously):***I create for myself, because my worth isn’t defined by others’ opinions.*

\[Panel 4: Both the boy and the girl, though miles apart, find themselves taking the first steps toward healing. The weight of rejection, family trauma, and self-doubt still linger—but now, they’re not as heavy. There is hope, there is purpose, and there is the freedom to create their own paths.\]





**Narration (Closing Line):** *""Every story has its roots, and every voice, no matter how faint, leaves an echo. In the spaces between rejection and recognition, pain and hope, lies the power to create, to connect, and to inspire.""*







\[End of Chapter.\]



**""Based on real events.""**

*There is a girl who lived through all the trauma you’ve seen. A girl who had her voice silenced, her dreams forgotten. And there is a boy who wrote her story, not knowing it would reach her. Maybe you're just looking at his work, but in the spaces between the ink and pages, there's more than just fiction. There's a truth, a voice, and a journey that was never meant to be lost.*



# The Surprise Extra Page

1. ***Scene Setup***
   * *The page begins with Tea standing on a brightly lit stage, holding an award, looking humble yet proud. He’s clearly overwhelmed but at peace, finally valued for who he truly is.*
   * *The audience is clapping, some standing in applause, but the focus shifts subtly to someone sitting quietly in the crowd.*
2. ***The Mystery Girl***
   * *The girl's face is hidden, either by her hair, shadows, or the angle of the scene.*
   * *She’s holding a diary on her lap. The diary is distinctive, matching the one Isha had in the main story.*
3. ***Visual Emphasis***
   * *The panel zooms in on the diary, showing small details that confirm it’s Isha’s without explicitly stating it.*
   * *A subtle hint—like a faint, barely visible name or the unique pattern of the cover—can add intrigue.*
4. ***Final Panel***
   * *The girl sits silently, watching Tea with a small, mysterious smile or calm expression.*
   * *The last frame is either a close-up of the diary or her hand gripping it gently, leaving readers questioning her identity.*

Is it artificial in any way? They sound appealing but if the taste is very artifical I can't imagine liking it. I hope to order again and try more flavors after my positive experience below with chocolate, coffee and vanilla. Please don't bother recommending banana because there is no amount of convincing someone can try to make me think it's not going to be awful, and I love bananas.

I recently changed over from Soylent powder as it's unobtainium without paying the Amazon tax. It is a bit different, and has a bit of the at slime at certain ratios of water and powder that Huel had but not nearly as bad and I'm still working on the perfect water to powder ratio. Right now I'm doing about 90g powder to 700 ml water and the slime isn't as bad. I prefer the consistency of my drinks on the thinner side. Plenny shake seems a bit thicker than Soylent powder, hense more water than my normal 90g powder of Soylent to 600ml water. In regards to edibililty it's far and away better than Huel Black in my opinion. Huel Black Chocolate was so bad so I nearly had to waste the entire bag, but instead incomporated just a little bit in my Soylent to not waste it but not make it inedible. I did have an issue with the shipper but that is not Jimmy Joy's fault and they helped me work with the shipper to get the package delivered. I do live in a ridiculous gated apartment complex (it's not fancy, this isn't a brag) that has no way to buzz people in, but I have no problems getting deliveries from any other carriers as there is a delivery enterance that is open during the day on the other side of the block. I am just going to have it shipped to a family member that I often visit and pick it up there instead to not have to worry about, so it's not the end of the world.

I know it's gross but my poops are totally different on Plenny Shake, a lot more bulk compared to Soylent. Any one else experience this? Sorry for the wall of text, a simple question about flavor turned into more and I didn't want to make multiple posts.",1,1736731109.0,JimmyJoyFood,0,1.0,False

- FIL (54) was widowed 2.5 years ago, now dating a 72 year old lady. 
- His new GF has almost 90k in debt, due to some lawsuit judgment
- she has no contact with her children, and when I've reached out to her children, they don't even acknowledge the relation. 
- FIL received somewhat sizeable life insurance policy when MIL passed away (enough to cover her debt and then some. 
- New GF treats my children (13,9) with very little patience and is often short tempered with them. 
- New GF is disliked by literally everyone in the family. 
- New GF repeatedly has gossiped to her coffee group about personal family matters, in an extremely small town (approx. 300 people) 


I personally have no issue having hard conversations, however I don't really want to ignite a family brawl- which would be inevitable. 

Most recently my wife was told some very personal information about someone in the family by the GF. Something the GF had no business telling anyone, and if that news was to be told to my wife it should have come from family, not from this person. 

Should I talk to my FIL and/or his GF and set some boundaries? Or do I just leave it alone? 

Also, what is the best way to address the way that she treats my children? My oldest has a learning disability and she treats him like he should know things he can't understand. 

I have politely explained this to her before, but it hasn't made a difference. 

I'm an Army guy, I have no issue being pretty aggressive standing up for my kids, but due to the dynamic of my FIL being pretty hardheaded this would likely cause some problems between us, which I really want to avoid. 

My FIL is pretty good at calling her out when she isn't treating my kids well, but she doesn't improve.

Potential trigger warning for personal details (nothing super crazy). The internet is about to learn some very personal details about my health. 

So, back in August of 2024 my boyfriend and I got back from a trip to Colorado, where I’d been in a hotel hot tub (this is an important detail). On the drive back from Colorado, I felt some mild UTI symptoms, but figured it was just from not drinking a lot of water during the long drive. The night after getting home, I suddenly felt very nauseous and had some chills. I had a low grade fever, and kept bouncing between hot flashes and shivering. At this point, no more UTI symptoms were present. 

This all continued into the next day until I went to the ER (a family friend who’s a doctor said to go to the ER instead of urgent care in case I needed an IV since urgent care doesn’t provide them). I did so, and was of course immediately put on an IV antibiotic. My urinalysis showed a high bacterial count, and my white blood cell count was through the roof. The doctor said I had a “significant UTI that was likely spreading to my kidneys,” and that I was fortunate to have gone to the ER before it got worse. The infection was likely from the hot tub, because it’s the only thing I can think of that would cause that. I stayed on the IV for a few hours before being prescribed an oral antibiotic to take for the next week. 

Towards the beginning of September, I began feeling pain in my lower left side, and went to urgent care. I did another urinalysis that came back clear, and that doctor informed me that my urine culture from the ER never actually grew any bacteria. The doctor then asked about sexual activity, and I explained that I’m a virgin and my boyfriend has also never been sexually active. The doctor said that even though I was an unlikely candidate for an STD, he still wanted me to do a vaginal swab to rule out any type of bacterial infection. That swab showed a SUPER tiny amount of Staphylococcus aureus (which is a common bacteria that is already essentially everywhere). Regardless, I was then prescribed a round of doxycycline. 

I continued to experience pain in my side after I was done with those antibiotics, and a CT scan was scheduled to rule out anything like an ovarian cyst. The scan didn’t show anything abnormal, and I was then referred to gynecology. That appointment yielded nothing notable, and a Pap smear wasn’t even done since I’m not sexually active (although, I am 21 years old). 

On November 10th, I suddenly began experiencing UTI symptoms. I would go to the bathroom, and then immediately feel like I needed to go again. I also felt a lot of pressure around my bladder. 

My PCP then showed that I was potentially constipated because I was noticeably backed up on my CT scan (my ENTIRE colon was full), even though I felt fine at the time of the scan. My PCP was wondering if that was the source of my lower left pain, as well as the bladder issues. Several rounds of laxatives later, the pain was gone, but the UTI symptoms remained. 

Several more urinalysis later, and they’ve all been normal. No urine culture has grown anything, even when I know I actually had an infection back in August. 

I’m still experiencing urinary frequency to the point it’s driving me crazy. No specific food seems to make things worse (like chocolate, tomatoes, etc..), and coffee has also never caused a flare up. It’s been near constant discomfort since November. The only thing that makes it worse is actually peeing. After I use the bathroom, I almost always feel worse right after (like I need to go again). There’s been no pain, but there’s been some bladder spasms (it feels like my bladder is twitching sometimes). It’s also always worse in the evening time. 

The only thing that seems to cause a “flare up” is sexual activity. Even though I haven’t had sex, by boyfriend and I will still—for lack of a better way of wording it—fool around. Orgasms are not painful, though. The only pain I ever had was from the constipation. 

My current diagnosis is interstitial cystitis, and I’ve been referred to a urologist to hopefully have a cystoscopy done. I don’t know if I actually have IC, though. I’ve wondered if it’s potentially pelvic floor dysfunction since I’ve also had issues with constipation, but I’m at a loss. 

Heating pads seem to help, but I honestly might just be relieved to have the comforting heat on my abdomen, as opposed to it actually helping symptoms. 

I apologize for the long post, but does anyone have any advice? Any potential suggestions as to what this might be? I’m tired of constantly being uncomfortable. ",1,1736730460.0,Interstitialcystitis,0,1.0,False

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity. While we're on the topic, since it fits better here than in most spots, I don't do the politics thing. If it's a requirement of yours that someone shares your exact political, cultural, or personal values, we should discuss it bluntly and quickly to see if something is possible between us. No 'side' or 'sphere' is one I relate all that much to and I have contentions with all of them.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention.

1i0259a,https://www.reddit.com/r/jackstauber/comments/1i0259a/revisiting_jack_staubers_musicart/,Revisiting Jack Staubers music/art.,"This will be an essay of some sorts, I just wanna write about Jack after listening to his music again. Here:

Jack Stauber, to me, is the 'perfect weirdcore' artist. A lot of theories about his work IS depressing, but the music is usually very highly energetic. While dealing with topics such as suicide and depression. His YouTube channel consists of 'short films' basically. I got recommended 'goldie' and it opened up a can of worms, and it caused me to go to back and listen to his music, and something about what he made, makes me feel a certain type of way. I was an avid Jack Stauber listener a couple years ago, I didn't branch out to other projects he made, because I was afraid that I wouldn't like them. What I listened to, e.g: 'Coffee' 'Two Time' 'Cupid' and 'Dog Nightmare' is what I stuck to. Yeah, they were more popular than 'Today Today' but they were nice to listen to, they were cheery, and 'happy' sounding, if you didn't pay attention to the lyrics. The visuals given on his YouTube channel are a bit eery and a lot of them deal with, gross bodily image, death and growing up. My personal favorite is 'New Normal', it holds a special place in my heart because of the memories surrounding it. It is, in my opinion, the best song he has made and has the visuals to help. And I don't think I can say more, this little essay isn't as in-depth as I wanted it to be. I hope it's good enough. All this to say that Jack Stauber will hold a special place in my heart, for all the memories surrounding the time that I was a big fan. For the smiles through hard times, I'll revisit him every now and then. I miss Jack, I hope he's doing okay.",1,1736730164.0,jackstauber,0,0.99,False

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity. While we're on the topic, since it fits better here than in most spots, I don't do the politics thing. If it's a requirement of yours that someone shares your exact political, cultural, or personal values, we should discuss it bluntly and quickly to see if something is possible between us. No 'side' or 'sphere' is one I relate all that much to and I have contentions with all of them.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity. While we're on the topic, since it fits better here than in most spots, I don't do the politics thing. If it's a requirement of yours that someone shares your exact political, cultural, or personal values, we should discuss it bluntly and quickly to see if something is possible between us. No 'side' or 'sphere' is one I relate all that much to and I have contentions with all of them.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way.

Also, I really cannot store carton milks dahil di ko lang din mauubos for sure so I would use creamer. Luckily, di naman nagi-interfere masyado ang lasa ng creamer pero the coffee is not just... memorable. Sobrang unsatisfying lagi.

With that, I'm not sure na tuloy if I'll continue this. I really want to save up by lessening my cafe drinks. Any tips on how to have better press or what to add to have better coffee? or baka may alternative instant coffees nalang?

Here once again trying to find my other half. Here’s some things I enjoy

•Music: I will chat your ear off about music. A good majority of my day is spent with music playing. HIM, Clutch, Fireball Ministry, Counterparts, Polaris, The Devil Wears Prada and a billion more. Far too many to list, actually. I also play music in my free time and enjoy writing with my friends. 

•Video Games: PC is where I play a good majority of my games. Countless hours talking trash with my friends on CS2, late nights of Lethal Company, Destiny 2 raids. I rarely play solo games but occasionally I will. 

•I enjoy outdoor activities as well. Skateboarding, disc golf, hiking, hammocking and various other activities. 

Just trying to find someone with a similar style as myself. Horror movie nerd, tattoo enthusiast, coffee enjoyer, beer connoisseur. lol
