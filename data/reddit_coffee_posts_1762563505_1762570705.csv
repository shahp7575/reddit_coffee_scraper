Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction! 

Here’s an icebreaker to help start a conversation / show me if you actually read through the post lol: what is something you are looking forward to / excited about?",1,1762570092.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

I just want to thank this amazing group. I don’t know what’s wrong with me but I only found out about this group two weeks ago 😅 — and it’s been incredibly helpful with all your comments and posts!

As a way of giving back, here’s my PMP journey.

⸻

🧩 Background

I’ve only been a Project Manager for 2 years in a Pharmaceutical company, and I came from a solid finance operations background. Project Management is still pretty new to me, and honestly, I took the PMP to reduce my imposter syndrome and specialize in something I truly enjoy doing.

The journey wasn’t easy. I suffered from severe insomnia for 2 weeks before the exam. During the final week, I tried everything — melatonin, magnesium glycinate, even Benadryl — but my mind just wouldn’t stop racing. The lack of sleep gave me migraines and brain fog. Thankfully, on exam day, I got 4–5 hours of sleep, no migraines, and a clear head. I took that as a good sign. 🙏

⸻

📚 My Study Journey (Started around end of July)

📘 Rita Mulcahy Book (Online)
Read it cover to cover. It’s simple, easy to follow, and really helped me understand the fundamentals.

📗 1000+ Practice Exam Book
A friend gave me this, and I started practicing with it early on. It helped me connect the dots and understand how concepts link together.

💻 PMI Study Hall (SH)
I saw so many reviews about this on Facebook, so I gave it a try. Dude, it was HARD!
My mini exams ranged from 40–80%, and my mock exam scores were 74%, 65%, 68%, and 62%. My confidence was at an all-time low two weeks before the exam 😭.

📝 ThirdRock Notes
Discovered this group’s recommendation after my 3rd mock exam and decided to buy it. It filled a lot of knowledge gaps! I read it thoroughly the day before my exam — not just the cheat sheet. It really helped me recall key concepts and terms (especially for drag-and-drop questions).

⸻

🧠 Exam Day (PearsonVUE Makati – Morning Schedule)

I took both breaks, but I accidentally overbreaked during the first one. Since there are no clocks, I didn’t realize it — so be careful! When I started the second set, my remaining time dropped from 154 mins to 153 mins. Lesson learned: overbreaks eat into your exam time ⏰

For snacks, I brought chocolate mallows, KitKat, Pocari Sweat, and Mountain Dew (I can’t drink coffee right now).

I was super nervous the whole time. My heart was racing, so I had to reread each question several times. The questions were quite different from SH — shorter, yes, but trickier because most options looked wrong. 😂
You just have to pick the “best” answer.

I got 6 drag-and-drop questions (which ate up my time 😭), no math questions (sad accountant moment), and around 3–4 multiple-answer questions. A mix of predictive, agile, and hybrid.

Mindsets help, but they’re not everything. Some questions didn’t make sense, and I had to logically eliminate and escalate in my head to choose the least-wrong option.

⸻

🎉 The Results

Surprisingly, I passed with AT-T-AT! Never expected it because after my exam, I wasn’t given any paper. I finished around 2 PM and received the results at 2 AM the next day.

When I saw the PMI email, I was crying! I honestly thought it was just some random badge notification like on Facebook 🤣 — but nope, it was THE email.

It still amazes me because my SH mock averages were just pretty average, and I was always low in People and Business Environment but high in Process. So that was really weird, but hey — thankful and relieved that it all worked out. 🙏

If I managed to do it with those scores, you absolutely can too — and even go Above Target! 💪

⸻

💡 My Advice:
	•	✍️ Write your formulas or notes on your scratch sheet right at the start.
	•	⏱️ Write down your time strategy (e.g., 155–80) since watches and visible clocks aren’t allowed.
	•	🧩 Practice in SH or any mock exam platform to build stamina for a 4-hour test.
	•	🔍 Review your wrong answers — don’t just memorize, understand why.
	•	⚠️ Know your risk management, stakeholder strategies, and tools well.
	•	📖 Don’t sleep on ThirdRock Notes — read it end-to-end, not just the cheat sheet.
	•	🙏 And most importantly, pray.

I finished with 16 minutes left, reviewed flagged items, and prayed before hitting Submit. I told God, “If it’s for me, let Your will be done.”

⸻

🏁 Final Thoughts:

You got this!
Trust your prep, be calm (unlike me 😂), and don’t be discouraged by low mock scores — let them push you harder. I can’t give a “safe” average, but I can say this: keep the faith and leave the rest to God.

I met a super cool nurse on Saturday, November 1, at River Park Square. I was watching my friends table near the escalator, probably sometime between 1 and 3… I think the sun was still out. She’s a nurse, and I helped her with the coolest black t-shirt, though ""helped"" might be generous. I was fumbling to make change and probably sounded just as clumsy trying to keep the conversation going.

I asked if she had a connection to the shirt and she started telling me about her Ancestry dna finds, things she learned about her mom's side of the family, and I'd really like to hear the rest of the story. She has an easy laugh and a way of asking questions that is thoughtful and curious. I wish I'd said so much more. So here I am, almost a week later, and I wish I'd said, ""Hey, want to grab coffee or lunch and finish this conversation sometime soon?"" But the moment slipped by before I caught my breath or started thinking. Regardless, I shared the story behind the shirt she bought and thought I saw a spark in her eyes as she listened. She even came back to say goodbye, and I still didn't say what I wanted to. I'm slow sometimes. And I I bounce between thinking ""maybe she'd say yes,"" and ""ok dude, you are totally misreading the scene."" 

If you were that cool nurse and also felt like there was a little more than casual small talk energy there, I'd love the chance to continue our discussion a bit more properly. Over coffee or lunch, or a walk in the tail end of the fall sunshine. I'd love to hear the rest of the story and maybe share some of mine. Even if it was just small talk and an over-read, I'd love to hear more of the story. 

And if she never sees this or doesn't want to talk, I hope that shirt's already had a few good outings and brings her a smile every time she wears it.",1,1762570040.0,Spokane,0,0.67,False

I’ve been making pour over for a few years now. I live in a place where local coffee shops are abundant. I’m not as deep or passionate about the hobby as it appears some people in this subreddit are, I just like enjoying local beans and pour over is my favorite way to make it. 

I’ve mostly been using my roommates kettles and I’ve been going without a scale, however it’s time to buy my own now. I domt want to cheap out, but I also don’t feel like I need a $200 scale or kettle.

I have a nice hand grinder and a Chemex. Considering buying the Hario switch too, just to try something new.

I enjoy light roasts and seem to gravitate to Ethiopian beans the most. 

Please send any recommendations you have.

1ordz18,https://www.reddit.com/r/bestkitchentool/comments/1ordz18/unlock_your_dishwashers_full_potential_the/,Unlock Your Dishwasher's Full Potential: The Secrets to Flawless Dishes Every Time,"Let's be honest. We've all been there. You open the dishwasher after a full cycle, expecting a cascade of sparkling clean dishes, only to be met with cloudy glasses, a greasy film on your plates, or—you guessed it—a spoon with a mysterious blob still stuck to it.

It's frustrating. You might think your dishwasher is on its last legs, or that you just got a dud. But what if I told you that your machine is probably fine? The real issue is often a few small, easily fixable habits.

This isn't about buying a new, expensive appliance. This is about finally mastering the one you already have. Let's turn that frustrating box into the workhorse it was meant to be.

---

## The ""Scrape, Don't Rinse"" Golden Rule

This is the single biggest mistake people make. We have this instinct to pre-wash our dishes before they even go in the dishwasher. Stop it right there.

Modern dishwasher detergents are designed with enzymes that *need* food particles to latch onto and break down. If you rinse your dishes until they're spotless, the detergent has nothing to work with. It essentially just sloshes around and can even etch your glassware over time, leading to permanent cloudiness.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=dishwasher)

> **Your new mantra: Scrape the solids, leave the smears.**

Use a spatula or your fork to get big chunks of food into the trash or compost. A little sauce, a few crumbs, or a bit of cheese is not just okay—it's *necessary* for a proper clean.

---

## The Art of Loading: A Game-Changer

How you load the dishwasher matters more than you think. It’s not a game of Tetris where the only goal is to fit everything in. It's about strategically placing items so they get hit by the water jets.

### Top Rack Real Estate

This is your delicate zone. The water pressure is a bit gentler up here.

-   **Glasses and Mugs:** Place them on the tines facing *down and in* towards the center. The main water spray arm is usually at the bottom, so angling them inward ensures the inside gets a thorough cleaning.
-   **Small Bowls:** Tilt them forward on the tines. This helps water run off and prevents them from pooling with dirty water.
-   **Plastics:** Always place plastic items on the top rack unless your dishwasher's manual says otherwise. The heating element is on the bottom, and you don't want melted plastic.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=dishwasher)

### Bottom Rack Power Players

This is the heavy-duty zone.

-   **Plates:** Face them *inwards* towards the center spray arm. Never let a large plate block the arm's rotation.
-   **Pots and Pans:** Place them upside down. Make sure they are secure and won't collect water.
-   **Utensils with Long Handles:** Lay them down horizontally to ensure they don't block the spray arm.

### The Silverware Basket Puzzle

Don't just throw all your forks in one compartment.

-   **Mix it up:** Place some forks handle-up, some handle-down. Do the same with spoons. This prevents them from ""nesting"" together, which shields them from the water and detergent.
-   **Knives:** For safety, always place sharp knives handle-down. Better yet, if you have a third-rack utensil tray, use that.

---

## Beyond the Detergent: The Unsung Heroes

Detergent is just one part of the equation. If you're only using pods or powder, you're missing out on a flawless finish.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=dishwasher)

### Are You Using Rinse Aid?

If you're not, you need to start. Rinse aid is not a gimmick. It's a surfactant that reduces the surface tension of water. This means instead of forming droplets that leave mineral spots behind, water sheets right off your dishes.

The result? Drier dishes, especially plastics, and *zero* hard water spots on your glassware. It's the difference between ""clean"" and ""sparkling.""

### The One Tool That Changed Everything for Me: The Dishwasher Cleaner

This is the thing I wish I had found years sooner. You clean your oven, you clean your coffee maker, but do you ever clean your dishwasher?

Over time, grease, limescale, and food sludge build up in the hidden parts of your machine—the filters, the spray arms, the internal pipes. This buildup is often the real culprit behind smelly dishes and poor performance.

Every couple of months, run a cleaning cycle with a dedicated dishwasher cleaner. These are formulated to break down that gunk without damaging the machine's components. It's not the same as running an empty cycle with vinegar, which can be too harsh on rubber seals. After the first time I used one, the difference was staggering. The machine was quieter, and the dishes came out noticeably cleaner. It felt like I had a brand-new appliance.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=dishwasher)

---

## Choosing Your Cycle Wisely

Don't just default to ""Normal"" and walk away. Your machine has different cycles for a reason.

-   **Auto/Smart:** This is your best friend. Modern dishwashers have sensors that detect how dirty the water is. They'll adjust the water temperature and cycle time accordingly. It’s surprisingly efficient.
-   **Heavy Duty:** Use this for caked-on, baked-on foods. It uses hotter water and runs longer.
-   **Quick Wash:** Perfect for lightly soiled dishes that you need in a pinch.
-   ** sanitize:** Great for baby bottles, cutting boards, or when someone in the house is sick. It uses extra-hot water to kill germs.

By understanding your dishwasher's language—scraping instead of rinsing, loading with intention, and using the right helpers—you can get consistently perfect results. It’s less work for you and a much better outcome for your dishes.

    single dad
    out of work
    2 kids
    please help

He was thirty-four years old.

He'd been homeless for almost two years.

He knocked on a driver's side window and the driver shook her head, not even making eye contact. The next lowered his window and told him to get a fucking job. Sometimes people asked where his kids were while he was out here. It was a fair question. Sometimes they spat at him. Sometimes they got really pissed because they had to work hard for their dime while he was out here begging for it. *A leech on society. A deadbeat. A liar. A fraud, a cheat, a swindler, a drain on the better elements of the world.* But usually they just ignored him. Once in a while they gave him some money, and that was what happened now as a woman distastefully held a ten-dollar bill out the window. “Thank you, ma'am,” said Miller, taking it. “Feed your children,” said the woman. Then the light changed from red to green and the woman drove off. Miller stepped off the street onto the paved shoulder, waited for the next red light, the next group of cars, and repeated.

“It's almost Fordian,” said Spector.

Nevis nodded, pouring coffee from a paper cup into his mouth. “Mhm.”

The pair of them were observing Miller through binoculars from behind the tinted windshield of their black spook car, parked an inconspicuous distance away. Spector continued: “It's like capitalism's chewed him up for so long he's applied capitalist praxis to panhandling. I mean, look: it’s a virtual assembly line, and there he dutifully goes, station to demeaning station, for an entire shift.”

“Yeah,” said Nevis.

The traffic lights changed a few times.

The radio played Janis Joplin.

“So,” said Nevis, holding an empty paper coffee cup, “you sure he's our guy?”

“I'm sure. No wife, no kids, no friends or relatives.”

“Ain't what his sign says.”

“Today.”

“Yeah, today.”

(Yesterday, Miller had been stranded in the city after getting mugged and needed money to get back to Pittsburgh, but that apparently didn't pull as hard on the heartstrings.)

“And you said he was in the army?”

“Sure was.”

“What stripe was he?”

“Didn't get past first, so I wouldn't count on his conditioning too much.”

“Didn't consider him suitable—or what?”

“Got tossed out before they could get the hooks into his head. Couldn't keep his opinions on point or to himself. Spoke his mind. *Independent thinker.*” Nevis grinned. “But there's more. Something I haven't told you. Here,” he said, tossing a fat file folder onto Spector’s lap.

Spector stuck a toothpick in his mouth and looked through the documents.

“Check his school records,” said Nevis.

Spector read them. “Good grades. No disciplinary problems. Straight through to high school graduation.”

“Check the district.”

Spector bit his toothpick so hard it cracked. He spat out the pieces. “This is almost too good. North Mayfield Public School Board, Cincinnati, Ohio—and, oh shit, class of 1952. That's where we test-ran *Idiom*, isn't it?”

“Uh huh,” said Nevis.

Spector picked up his binoculars and watched Miller beg for a few moments.

Nevis continued: “Simplants. False memories. LSD-laced fruit juice. Mass hypnosis. From what I've heard, it was a real fucking mental playground over there.”

“They shut it down in what, fifty-four?”

“Fifty-three. A lot of the guys who worked there went on to *Ultra* and *Monarch*. Some fell off the edge entirely, so you know what that means.”

“And a lot of the subjects ended up dead, or worse—didn't they?”

“Not our guy, though.”

“No.”

“Not yet anyway.” They both laughed, and they soon drove away.

It had started raining, and Donald Miller kept going up to car after car, holding his cardboard sign, now wet and starting to fall apart, collecting spare change from the spared kindness of strangers.

A few days later a black car pulled up to the same intersection. Donald Miller walked up to it and knocked on the driver's side window. Spector was behind the wheel. “Spare any money?” asked Donald Miller, showing his sign, which today said he had one child but that child had a form of cancer whose treatment Miller couldn't afford.

“No, but I can spare you a job,” said Spector.

“A job. *What?*” said Miller.

“Yes. I'm offering you work, Donald.”

“What kind of—hey, how-the-hell do you know my name, huh!”

“Relax, Donald. Get in.”

“No,” said Miller, backing slowly away, almost into another vehicle, whose driver **honked.** Donald jumped. “Don't you want to hear my offer?” asked Spector.

“I don't have the skills for no job, man. Do you think if I had the skills I'd be out here doing this shit?”

“You've already demonstrated the two basic requirements: standing and holding a sign. You're qualified. Now get in the car, please.”

“The *fuck* is this?”

Spector smiled. “Donald, Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office.”

“What, you're fucking crazy, man,” said Miller, his body tensing up, a change coming over his eyes and a self-disbelief over his face. “Who the fuck is—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald. Please get in the car.”

Miller opened his mouth, looked briefly toward the sky, then crossed to the other side of the car, opened the passenger side door, and sat politely beside Spector. When he was settled, Nevis—from the back seat—threw a thick hood over his head and stuck him with a syringe.

Donald Miller woke up naked next to a pile of drab dockworkers’ clothes and a bag of money. He was disoriented, afraid, and about to run when Spector grabbed his arm. “It's all right, Donald,” he said. “You don't need to be afraid. You're in Principal Lewis’ office now. He has a job for you to do. Just put on those clothes.”

“Put them on and do what?”

Miller was looking at the bag of money. He noted
other people here, including a man in a dark suit, and several people with cameras and film equipment. “Like I said before, all you have to do is hold a sign.”

“How come—how come I don't remember coming here? Huh? *Why am I fucking naked?* Hey, man… you fucking kidnapped me didn't you!”

“You're naked because your clothes were so dirty they posed a danger to your health. We took them off. Try to remember: I offered you a job this morning, Donald. You accepted and willingly got in the car with me. You don't remember the ride because you feel asleep. You were very tired. We didn't want to wake you until you were rested.”

Miller breathed heavily. “Job doing what?”

“Holding a sign.”

“OK, and what's the sign say?”

“It doesn't say anything, Donald—completely blank—just as Principal Lewis likes it.”

“And the clothes, do I get to keep the clothes after we're done. Because you took my old clothes, you…”

“You’ll get new clothes,” said Spector.

“And Principal Lewis wants me to put on these clothes and hold the completely blank sign, and then I’ll get paid and get new clothes?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

So, for the next two weeks, Donald Miller put on various kinds of working clothes, held blank signs, sometimes walked, sometimes stood still, sometimes opened his mouth and sometimes closed it, sometimes sat, or lay down on the ground; or on the floor, because he did all these things in different locations, inside and outside: on an empty factory floor, in a muddy field, on a stretch of traffic-less road. And all the while they took photographs of him and filmed him, and he never knew what any of it meant, why he was doing it. They only spoke to give him directions: “Look angry,” “Pretend you’re starving,” “Look like someone’s about to push you in the back,” “like you’re jostling for position,” “like you’ve had enough and you just can’t fucking take it anymore and whatever you want you’re gonna have to fight for it!”

Then it was over.

Spector shook his hand, they bought him a couple of outfits, paid him his money and sent him on his way. “Sorry, we have to do it this way, but—”

Donald Miller found himself at night in a motel room rented under a name he didn’t recognise, with a printed note saying he could stay as long as he liked. He stayed two days before buying a bus ticket back to Cincinnati, where he was from. He lived well there for a while. The money wasn’t insignificant, and he spent it with restraint, but even the new clothes and money couldn’t wipe the stain of homelessness off him, and he couldn’t convince anyone to give him a job. Less than a year later he was back on the streets begging.

The whole episode—because that’s how he thought about it—was clouded by creamy surreality, which just thickened as time went by until it seemed like it had been a dream, as distant as his time in high school.

One day, several years later, Donald Miller was standing outside an electronics shop, the kind with all the new televisions set up in the display window by the street and turned so that all who passed by could see them and watch and marvel and need to have a set of his own. Miller was watching daytime programming on one of the sets when the broadcast *on all the sets,* which had been showing a few different stations—*cut suddenly to a news alert:*

A few people stopped to watch alongside.

“What’s going on?” a man asked.

“I don’t know,” said Miller.

*On the screens, a handsome news reporter was solemnly reading out a statement about anti-government protests happening in some communist country in eastern Europe. “...they marched again today, in the hundreds of thousands, shouting, ‘We want bread! We want freedom!’ and holding signs denouncing the current regime and imploring the West—and the United States specifically—for help.”* There was more, but Miller had stopped listening. There rose a ***thumping-coursing*** followed by a ***ringing*** in his ears. And his eyes were focused on *the faces of the protestors in the photos and clips the news reporter was speaking over:* because they were his face: **all of them were his face!**

“Hey!” Miller yelled.

The people gathered at the electronics store window looked over at him. “You all right there, buddy?” one asked.

“Don’t you see: it’s me.”

“What’s you?”

“There—” He pointed with a shaking finger at one of the television sets. “—me.”

“Which one, honey?” a woman asked, chuckling.

Miller grabbed her by the shoulders, startling her, saying: “All of them. All of them are me.” And, looking back at the set, he started hitting the display window with his hand. “That one and that one, and that one. That one, that one, that one…”

He grew hysterical, violent; but the people on the street worked together to subdue him, and the owner of the electronics store called the police. The police picked him up, asked him a few questions and drove him to a mental institution. They suggested he stay here, “just for a few days, until you’re better,” and when he insisted he didn’t want to stay there, they changed their suggestion to a command backed by the law and threatened him with charges: assault, resisting arrest, loitering, vagrancy.

Donald Miller was in the institution when the President came on the television and in a serious address to the nation declared that the United States of America, a God fearing and freedom loving people, could no longer stand idly by while another people, equally deserving of freedom, yearning for it, was systematically oppressed. Those people, the President said, would now be saved and welcomed into the arms of the West. After that, the President declared war on the country in which Donald Miller had seen himself protesting against the government.

Once the shock of it passed, being committed wasn’t so bad. It was warm, there was free food and free television, and most of the nurses were nice enough. Sure, there were crazies in there, people who’d bang their heads against the wall or speak in made-up languages, but not everyone was like that, and it was easy to avoid the ones who were. The doctors were the worst part: not because they were cruel but because they were cold, and all they ever did was ask questions and make notes and never tell you what the notes were about. Eventually he even confided in one doctor, a young woman named Angeline, and told her the truth about what had happened to him. He talked to Angeline more often after that, which was fine with him. Then, unexpectedly, Angelina was gone and a man with a buzzcut came to talk to him. “Who are you?” Miller asked. “My name’s Fitzsimmons.” “Are you a doctor?” “No, I’m not a doctor. I work for the government.” “What do you want with me?” “To ask you some questions.” “You sound like a doctor, because that’s all they ever do: ask questions.” “Does that mean you won’t answer my questions?” “Can you get me out of here?” “Maybe.” “Depending on my answers?” “That’s right.” “So you’ll answer my questions?” asked Fitzsimmons. “Uh huh,” said Miller. “You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

The questions were bizarre and uncomfortable. Things like, *have you ever tortured an animal?* and *do you masturbate?* and *have you ever had sexual thoughts about someone in your immediate family?* 

Things like that, that almost made you want to dredge your own soul after. At one point, Fitzsimmons placed a dozen pictures of ink blots in front of Miller and asked him *which one of these best describes what you’d feel if I told you Dr. Angeline had been murdered?* When Miller picked one at random because he didn’t understand how what he felt corresponded to what was on the pictures, Fitzsimmons followed up with: *And what part of your body would you feel it in?* “I don’t know.” *Why not?* “Because it hasn’t happened so I haven’t felt it.” *How would you feel if you were the one who murdered her, Donald?* “Why would I do that?” *You murdered her, Donald.* “No.” *Donald, you murdered her and they’re going to put you away for a long long time—and not in a nice place like this but in a real facility with real hardened criminals.* “I didn’t fucking do it!” Miller screamed. “I didn’t fucking kill her! I didn’t—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald.”

Miller’s anger dissipated.

He sat now with his hands crossed calmly on his lap, looking at Fitzsimmons with a kind of blunt stupidity. “Did I do fine?” he asked.

“Yes, Donald. You did fine. Thank you for your patience,” said Fitzsimmons and left.

In the parking lot by the mental institution stood a black spook car with tinted windows. Fitzsimmons crossed from the main facility doors and got in. Spector sat in the driver’s seat. “How’d he do?” Spector asked.

“Borderline,” said Fitzsimmons.

“Explain.”

“It’s not that he couldn’t do it—I think he could. I just don’t have the confidence he’d keep it together afterwards. He’s fundamentally cracked. *All the king’s horses and all the king’s men,* you know?”

“That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as long as he *really* loses it.”

“That part’s manageable.”

“I hate to ask this favour, but you know how things are. The current administation—well, the budget’s just not there, which means the agency’s all about finding efficiencies. In that context, a re-used asset’s a real cost-saver.”

“OK,” said Fitzsimmons. “I’ll recommend it.”

“Thanks,” said Spector.

For Donald Miller, committed life went on. Doctor Angeline never came back, and nothing ever came of the Fitzsimmons interview, so Miller assumed he’d flubbed it. The other patients appeared and disappeared, never making much of an impression. Miller suffered through bouts of anxiety, depression and sometimes difficulty telling truth from fiction. The doctors had cured him of his initial delusion that he was actually hundreds of thousands of people in eastern Europe, but doubts remained. He simply learned to keep them internal. Then life got better. Miller made a friend, a new patient named Wellesley. Wellesley was also from Cincinatti, and the two of them got on splendidly. Finally, Miller had someone to talk to—to *really* talk to. As far as Miller saw it, Wellesley’s only flaw was that he was too interested in politics, always going on about international affairs and domestic policy, and how he hated the communists and hated the current administration for not being hard enough on them, and on internal communists, “because those are the worst, Donny. The scheming little rats that live among us.”

Miller didn’t say much of anything about that kind of stuff at first, but when he realized it made Wellesley happy to be humoured, he humoured him. He started repeating Wellesley’s statements to himself at night, and as he repeated them he started believing them. He read books that Wellesley gave him, smuggled into the institution by an acquaintance, like contraband. “And what’s *that* tell you about this great republic of ours? Land of the free, yet we can’t read everything we want to read.” Miller had never been interested in policy before. Now he learned how he was governed, oppressed, undermined by the enemy within. “There’s even some of that ilk in this hospital,” Wellesley told him one evening. “Some of the doctors and staff—they’re pure reds. I’ve heard them talking in the lounge about unions and racial justice.”

“I thought only poor people were communists,” said Miller.

“That’s what they want you to believe, so that if you ever get real mad about it you’ll turn on your fellow man instead of the real enemy: the one in power. Ain’t that a real mad fucking world. Everything’s all messed up. Like take—” Wellesley went silent and shook his head. A nurse walked by. “—no, nevermind, man. I don’t want to get you mixed up in anything.”

“Tell me,” Miller implored him.

“Like, well, take—take the President. He says all the right things in public, but that’s only to get elected. If you look at what he’s actually doing, like the policies and the appointments and where he spends *our* money, you can see his true fucking colours.”

Later they talked about revolutions, the American, the French, the Russian, and how if things got too bad the only way out was violence. “But it’s not always like that. The violence doesn’t have to be total. It can be smart, targeted. You take out the right person at the right time and maybe you save a million lives.

“Don’t you agree?” asked Wellesley.

“I guess...”

“Come on—you can be more honest than that. It’s just the two of us here. Two dregs of society that no one gives a shit about.”

“I agree,” said Miller.

Wellesley slapped him on the shoulder. “You know what?”

“What?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

Three months later, much to his surprise, Donald Miller was released from the mental institution he’d spent the last few years in. He even got a little piece of paper that declared him sane. He tried writing Wellesley a few times from the outside, but he never got a response. When he got up the courage to show up at the institution, he was told by a nurse that she shouldn’t be telling him this *but that Wellesley had taken his own life soon after Miller was released.*

Alone again, Donald Miller tried integrating into society, but it was tough going. He couldn’t make friends, and he couldn’t hold down a job. He was a hard worker but always too weird. People didn’t like him, or found him off-putting or creepy, or sometimes they intentionally made his life so unbearable he had to leave, then they pretended they were sorry to see him go. No one ever said anything true or concrete, like, “You stink,” or “You don’t shave regularly enough,” or “Your cologne smells cheap.” It was always merely hinted at, suggested. He was different. He didn’t belong. He felt unwelcome everywhere. His only solace was books, because books never judged him. He realized he hated the world around him, and whenever the President was on television, he hated the President too.

One day, Donald Miller woke up and knew exactly what he needed to do.

After all, he was a bright guy.

It was three weeks before Christmas. The snow was coming down slowly in big white flakes. The mood was magical, and Spector was sitting at a table in an upscale New York City restaurant with his wife and kids, ordering French wine and *magret de canard,* which was just a fancy French term for duck breast. The lighting was low so you could see winter through the big windows. A jazz band was playing something by Duke Ellington. Then the restaurant’s phone rang. Someone picked up. “Yes?” Somebody *whispered.* “Now?” asked the person who’d picked up the call. A commotion began, spreading from the staff to the diners and back to the staff, until someone turned a television on in the kitchen, and someone else dropped a glass, and a woman screamed as the glass shattered and a man yelled, “Oh my God, he’s been shot! The President’s been shot.”

At those words everyone in the restaurant jumped—*everyone but Spector,* who calmly swallowed the duck he’d been chewing, picked up his glass of wine and made a silent toast to the future of the agency.

The dinner was, understandably, cut short, and everyone made their way out to their cars to drive home through the falling snow. In his car, Spector assured his family that everything would be fine. Then he listened without comment as his wife and daughter exchanged uninformed opinions about *who would do such a terrible thing* and *what if we’re under attack* and *maybe it’s the Soviet Union…*

As he pulled into the street on which their hotel was located, Spector noticed a black car with tinted windows idling across from the hotel entrance. 

Passing, he waved, *and the car merged into traffic and drove obediently away.*",1,1762569142.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

“How come—how come I don't remember coming here? Huh? *Why am I fucking naked?* Hey, man… you fucking kidnapped me didn't you!”

“You're naked because your clothes were so dirty they posed a danger to your health. We took them off. Try to remember: I offered you a job this morning, Donald. You accepted and willingly got in the car with me. You don't remember the ride because you feel asleep. You were very tired. We didn't want to wake you until you were rested.”

Miller breathed heavily. “Job doing what?”

“Holding a sign.”

“OK, and what's the sign say?”

“It doesn't say anything, Donald—completely blank—just as Principal Lewis likes it.”

“And the clothes, do I get to keep the clothes after we're done. Because you took my old clothes, you…”

“You’ll get new clothes,” said Spector.

“And Principal Lewis wants me to put on these clothes and hold the completely blank sign, and then I’ll get paid and get new clothes?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

So, for the next two weeks, Donald Miller put on various kinds of working clothes, held blank signs, sometimes walked, sometimes stood still, sometimes opened his mouth and sometimes closed it, sometimes sat, or lay down on the ground; or on the floor, because he did all these things in different locations, inside and outside: on an empty factory floor, in a muddy field, on a stretch of traffic-less road. And all the while they took photographs of him and filmed him, and he never knew what any of it meant, why he was doing it. They only spoke to give him directions: “Look angry,” “Pretend you’re starving,” “Look like someone’s about to push you in the back,” “like you’re jostling for position,” “like you’ve had enough and you just can’t fucking take it anymore and whatever you want you’re gonna have to fight for it!”

Then it was over.

Spector shook his hand, they bought him a couple of outfits, paid him his money and sent him on his way. “Sorry, we have to do it this way, but—”

Donald Miller found himself at night in a motel room rented under a name he didn’t recognise, with a printed note saying he could stay as long as he liked. He stayed two days before buying a bus ticket back to Cincinnati, where he was from. He lived well there for a while. The money wasn’t insignificant, and he spent it with restraint, but even the new clothes and money couldn’t wipe the stain of homelessness off him, and he couldn’t convince anyone to give him a job. Less than a year later he was back on the streets begging.

The whole episode—because that’s how he thought about it—was clouded by creamy surreality, which just thickened as time went by until it seemed like it had been a dream, as distant as his time in high school.

One day, several years later, Donald Miller was standing outside an electronics shop, the kind with all the new televisions set up in the display window by the street and turned so that all who passed by could see them and watch and marvel and need to have a set of his own. Miller was watching daytime programming on one of the sets when the broadcast *on all the sets,* which had been showing a few different stations—*cut suddenly to a news alert:*

A few people stopped to watch alongside.

“What’s going on?” a man asked.

“I don’t know,” said Miller.

*On the screens, a handsome news reporter was solemnly reading out a statement about anti-government protests happening in some communist country in eastern Europe. “...they marched again today, in the hundreds of thousands, shouting, ‘We want bread! We want freedom!’ and holding signs denouncing the current regime and imploring the West—and the United States specifically—for help.”* There was more, but Miller had stopped listening. There rose a ***thumping-coursing*** followed by a ***ringing*** in his ears. And his eyes were focused on *the faces of the protestors in the photos and clips the news reporter was speaking over:* because they were his face: **all of them were his face!**

“Hey!” Miller yelled.

The people gathered at the electronics store window looked over at him. “You all right there, buddy?” one asked.

“Don’t you see: it’s me.”

“What’s you?”

“There—” He pointed with a shaking finger at one of the television sets. “—me.”

“Which one, honey?” a woman asked, chuckling.

Miller grabbed her by the shoulders, startling her, saying: “All of them. All of them are me.” And, looking back at the set, he started hitting the display window with his hand. “That one and that one, and that one. That one, that one, that one…”

He grew hysterical, violent; but the people on the street worked together to subdue him, and the owner of the electronics store called the police. The police picked him up, asked him a few questions and drove him to a mental institution. They suggested he stay here, “just for a few days, until you’re better,” and when he insisted he didn’t want to stay there, they changed their suggestion to a command backed by the law and threatened him with charges: assault, resisting arrest, loitering, vagrancy.

Donald Miller was in the institution when the President came on the television and in a serious address to the nation declared that the United States of America, a God fearing and freedom loving people, could no longer stand idly by while another people, equally deserving of freedom, yearning for it, was systematically oppressed. Those people, the President said, would now be saved and welcomed into the arms of the West. After that, the President declared war on the country in which Donald Miller had seen himself protesting against the government.

Once the shock of it passed, being committed wasn’t so bad. It was warm, there was free food and free television, and most of the nurses were nice enough. Sure, there were crazies in there, people who’d bang their heads against the wall or speak in made-up languages, but not everyone was like that, and it was easy to avoid the ones who were. The doctors were the worst part: not because they were cruel but because they were cold, and all they ever did was ask questions and make notes and never tell you what the notes were about. Eventually he even confided in one doctor, a young woman named Angeline, and told her the truth about what had happened to him. He talked to Angeline more often after that, which was fine with him. Then, unexpectedly, Angelina was gone and a man with a buzzcut came to talk to him. “Who are you?” Miller asked. “My name’s Fitzsimmons.” “Are you a doctor?” “No, I’m not a doctor. I work for the government.” “What do you want with me?” “To ask you some questions.” “You sound like a doctor, because that’s all they ever do: ask questions.” “Does that mean you won’t answer my questions?” “Can you get me out of here?” “Maybe.” “Depending on my answers?” “That’s right.” “So you’ll answer my questions?” asked Fitzsimmons. “Uh huh,” said Miller. “You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

The questions were bizarre and uncomfortable. Things like, *have you ever tortured an animal?* and *do you masturbate?* and *have you ever had sexual thoughts about someone in your immediate family?* 

Things like that, that almost made you want to dredge your own soul after. At one point, Fitzsimmons placed a dozen pictures of ink blots in front of Miller and asked him *which one of these best describes what you’d feel if I told you Dr. Angeline had been murdered?* When Miller picked one at random because he didn’t understand how what he felt corresponded to what was on the pictures, Fitzsimmons followed up with: *And what part of your body would you feel it in?* “I don’t know.” *Why not?* “Because it hasn’t happened so I haven’t felt it.” *How would you feel if you were the one who murdered her, Donald?* “Why would I do that?” *You murdered her, Donald.* “No.” *Donald, you murdered her and they’re going to put you away for a long long time—and not in a nice place like this but in a real facility with real hardened criminals.* “I didn’t fucking do it!” Miller screamed. “I didn’t fucking kill her! I didn’t—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald.”

Miller’s anger dissipated.

He sat now with his hands crossed calmly on his lap, looking at Fitzsimmons with a kind of blunt stupidity. “Did I do fine?” he asked.

“Yes, Donald. You did fine. Thank you for your patience,” said Fitzsimmons and left.

In the parking lot by the mental institution stood a black spook car with tinted windows. Fitzsimmons crossed from the main facility doors and got in. Spector sat in the driver’s seat. “How’d he do?” Spector asked.

“Borderline,” said Fitzsimmons.

“Explain.”

“It’s not that he couldn’t do it—I think he could. I just don’t have the confidence he’d keep it together afterwards. He’s fundamentally cracked. *All the king’s horses and all the king’s men,* you know?”

“That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as long as he *really* loses it.”

“That part’s manageable.”

“I hate to ask this favour, but you know how things are. The current administation—well, the budget’s just not there, which means the agency’s all about finding efficiencies. In that context, a re-used asset’s a real cost-saver.”

“OK,” said Fitzsimmons. “I’ll recommend it.”

“Thanks,” said Spector.

For Donald Miller, committed life went on. Doctor Angeline never came back, and nothing ever came of the Fitzsimmons interview, so Miller assumed he’d flubbed it. The other patients appeared and disappeared, never making much of an impression. Miller suffered through bouts of anxiety, depression and sometimes difficulty telling truth from fiction. The doctors had cured him of his initial delusion that he was actually hundreds of thousands of people in eastern Europe, but doubts remained. He simply learned to keep them internal. Then life got better. Miller made a friend, a new patient named Wellesley. Wellesley was also from Cincinatti, and the two of them got on splendidly. Finally, Miller had someone to talk to—to *really* talk to. As far as Miller saw it, Wellesley’s only flaw was that he was too interested in politics, always going on about international affairs and domestic policy, and how he hated the communists and hated the current administration for not being hard enough on them, and on internal communists, “because those are the worst, Donny. The scheming little rats that live among us.”

Miller didn’t say much of anything about that kind of stuff at first, but when he realized it made Wellesley happy to be humoured, he humoured him. He started repeating Wellesley’s statements to himself at night, and as he repeated them he started believing them. He read books that Wellesley gave him, smuggled into the institution by an acquaintance, like contraband. “And what’s *that* tell you about this great republic of ours? Land of the free, yet we can’t read everything we want to read.” Miller had never been interested in policy before. Now he learned how he was governed, oppressed, undermined by the enemy within. “There’s even some of that ilk in this hospital,” Wellesley told him one evening. “Some of the doctors and staff—they’re pure reds. I’ve heard them talking in the lounge about unions and racial justice.”

“I thought only poor people were communists,” said Miller.

“That’s what they want you to believe, so that if you ever get real mad about it you’ll turn on your fellow man instead of the real enemy: the one in power. Ain’t that a real mad fucking world. Everything’s all messed up. Like take—” Wellesley went silent and shook his head. A nurse walked by. “—no, nevermind, man. I don’t want to get you mixed up in anything.”

“Tell me,” Miller implored him.

“Like, well, take—take the President. He says all the right things in public, but that’s only to get elected. If you look at what he’s actually doing, like the policies and the appointments and where he spends *our* money, you can see his true fucking colours.”

Later they talked about revolutions, the American, the French, the Russian, and how if things got too bad the only way out was violence. “But it’s not always like that. The violence doesn’t have to be total. It can be smart, targeted. You take out the right person at the right time and maybe you save a million lives.

“Don’t you agree?” asked Wellesley.

“I guess...”

“Come on—you can be more honest than that. It’s just the two of us here. Two dregs of society that no one gives a shit about.”

“I agree,” said Miller.

Wellesley slapped him on the shoulder. “You know what?”

“What?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

Three months later, much to his surprise, Donald Miller was released from the mental institution he’d spent the last few years in. He even got a little piece of paper that declared him sane. He tried writing Wellesley a few times from the outside, but he never got a response. When he got up the courage to show up at the institution, he was told by a nurse that she shouldn’t be telling him this *but that Wellesley had taken his own life soon after Miller was released.*

Alone again, Donald Miller tried integrating into society, but it was tough going. He couldn’t make friends, and he couldn’t hold down a job. He was a hard worker but always too weird. People didn’t like him, or found him off-putting or creepy, or sometimes they intentionally made his life so unbearable he had to leave, then they pretended they were sorry to see him go. No one ever said anything true or concrete, like, “You stink,” or “You don’t shave regularly enough,” or “Your cologne smells cheap.” It was always merely hinted at, suggested. He was different. He didn’t belong. He felt unwelcome everywhere. His only solace was books, because books never judged him. He realized he hated the world around him, and whenever the President was on television, he hated the President too.

One day, Donald Miller woke up and knew exactly what he needed to do.

After all, he was a bright guy.

It was three weeks before Christmas. The snow was coming down slowly in big white flakes. The mood was magical, and Spector was sitting at a table in an upscale New York City restaurant with his wife and kids, ordering French wine and *magret de canard,* which was just a fancy French term for duck breast. The lighting was low so you could see winter through the big windows. A jazz band was playing something by Duke Ellington. Then the restaurant’s phone rang. Someone picked up. “Yes?” Somebody *whispered.* “Now?” asked the person who’d picked up the call. A commotion began, spreading from the staff to the diners and back to the staff, until someone turned a television on in the kitchen, and someone else dropped a glass, and a woman screamed as the glass shattered and a man yelled, “Oh my God, he’s been shot! The President’s been shot.”

At those words everyone in the restaurant jumped—*everyone but Spector,* who calmly swallowed the duck he’d been chewing, picked up his glass of wine and made a silent toast to the future of the agency.

The dinner was, understandably, cut short, and everyone made their way out to their cars to drive home through the falling snow. In his car, Spector assured his family that everything would be fine. Then he listened without comment as his wife and daughter exchanged uninformed opinions about *who would do such a terrible thing* and *what if we’re under attack* and *maybe it’s the Soviet Union…*

As he pulled into the street on which their hotel was located, Spector noticed a black car with tinted windows idling across from the hotel entrance. 

Passing, he waved, *and the car merged into traffic and drove obediently away.*",1,1762569081.0,stories,1,1.0,False
1ordsk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1ordsk9/spooks/,Spooks,"It was a busy intersection and the weather was bad, but Donald Miller was out there, knocking on car windows while holding a sign that said:

    single dad
    out of work
    2 kids
    please help

He was thirty-four years old.

He'd been homeless for almost two years.

He knocked on a driver's side window and the driver shook her head, not even making eye contact. The next lowered his window and told him to get a fucking job. Sometimes people asked where his kids were while he was out here. It was a fair question. Sometimes they spat at him. Sometimes they got really pissed because they had to work hard for their dime while he was out here begging for it. *A leech on society. A deadbeat. A liar. A fraud, a cheat, a swindler, a drain on the better elements of the world.* But usually they just ignored him. Once in a while they gave him some money, and that was what happened now as a woman distastefully held a ten-dollar bill out the window. “Thank you, ma'am,” said Miller, taking it. “Feed your children,” said the woman. Then the light changed from red to green and the woman drove off. Miller stepped off the street onto the paved shoulder, waited for the next red light, the next group of cars, and repeated.

“It's almost Fordian,” said Spector.

Nevis nodded, pouring coffee from a paper cup into his mouth. “Mhm.”

The pair of them were observing Miller through binoculars from behind the tinted windshield of their black spook car, parked an inconspicuous distance away. Spector continued: “It's like capitalism's chewed him up for so long he's applied capitalist praxis to panhandling. I mean, look: it’s a virtual assembly line, and there he dutifully goes, station to demeaning station, for an entire shift.”

“Yeah,” said Nevis.

The traffic lights changed a few times.

The radio played Janis Joplin.

“So,” said Nevis, holding an empty paper coffee cup, “you sure he's our guy?”

“I'm sure. No wife, no kids, no friends or relatives.”

“Ain't what his sign says.”

“Today.”

“Yeah, today.”

(Yesterday, Miller had been stranded in the city after getting mugged and needed money to get back to Pittsburgh, but that apparently didn't pull as hard on the heartstrings.)

“And you said he was in the army?”

“Sure was.”

“What stripe was he?”

“Didn't get past first, so I wouldn't count on his conditioning too much.”

“Didn't consider him suitable—or what?”

“Got tossed out before they could get the hooks into his head. Couldn't keep his opinions on point or to himself. Spoke his mind. *Independent thinker.*” Nevis grinned. “But there's more. Something I haven't told you. Here,” he said, tossing a fat file folder onto Spector’s lap.

Spector stuck a toothpick in his mouth and looked through the documents.

“Check his school records,” said Nevis.

Spector read them. “Good grades. No disciplinary problems. Straight through to high school graduation.”

“Check the district.”

Spector bit his toothpick so hard it cracked. He spat out the pieces. “This is almost too good. North Mayfield Public School Board, Cincinnati, Ohio—and, oh shit, class of 1952. That's where we test-ran *Idiom*, isn't it?”

“Uh huh,” said Nevis.

Spector picked up his binoculars and watched Miller beg for a few moments.

Nevis continued: “Simplants. False memories. LSD-laced fruit juice. Mass hypnosis. From what I've heard, it was a real fucking mental playground over there.”

“They shut it down in what, fifty-four?”

“Fifty-three. A lot of the guys who worked there went on to *Ultra* and *Monarch*. Some fell off the edge entirely, so you know what that means.”

“And a lot of the subjects ended up dead, or worse—didn't they?”

“Not our guy, though.”

“No.”

“Not yet anyway.” They both laughed, and they soon drove away.

It had started raining, and Donald Miller kept going up to car after car, holding his cardboard sign, now wet and starting to fall apart, collecting spare change from the spared kindness of strangers.

A few days later a black car pulled up to the same intersection. Donald Miller walked up to it and knocked on the driver's side window. Spector was behind the wheel. “Spare any money?” asked Donald Miller, showing his sign, which today said he had one child but that child had a form of cancer whose treatment Miller couldn't afford.

“No, but I can spare you a job,” said Spector.

“A job. *What?*” said Miller.

“Yes. I'm offering you work, Donald.”

“What kind of—hey, how-the-hell do you know my name, huh!”

“Relax, Donald. Get in.”

“No,” said Miller, backing slowly away, almost into another vehicle, whose driver **honked.** Donald jumped. “Don't you want to hear my offer?” asked Spector.

“I don't have the skills for no job, man. Do you think if I had the skills I'd be out here doing this shit?”

“You've already demonstrated the two basic requirements: standing and holding a sign. You're qualified. Now get in the car, please.”

“The *fuck* is this?”

Spector smiled. “Donald, Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office.”

“What, you're fucking crazy, man,” said Miller, his body tensing up, a change coming over his eyes and a self-disbelief over his face. “Who the fuck is—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald. Please get in the car.”

Miller opened his mouth, looked briefly toward the sky, then crossed to the other side of the car, opened the passenger side door, and sat politely beside Spector. When he was settled, Nevis—from the back seat—threw a thick hood over his head and stuck him with a syringe.

Donald Miller woke up naked next to a pile of drab dockworkers’ clothes and a bag of money. He was disoriented, afraid, and about to run when Spector grabbed his arm. “It's all right, Donald,” he said. “You don't need to be afraid. You're in Principal Lewis’ office now. He has a job for you to do. Just put on those clothes.”

“Put them on and do what?”

Miller was looking at the bag of money. He noted
other people here, including a man in a dark suit, and several people with cameras and film equipment. “Like I said before, all you have to do is hold a sign.”

“How come—how come I don't remember coming here? Huh? *Why am I fucking naked?* Hey, man… you fucking kidnapped me didn't you!”

“You're naked because your clothes were so dirty they posed a danger to your health. We took them off. Try to remember: I offered you a job this morning, Donald.

I’ve heard them talking in the lounge about unions and racial justice.”

“I thought only poor people were communists,” said Miller.

“That’s what they want you to believe, so that if you ever get real mad about it you’ll turn on your fellow man instead of the real enemy: the one in power. Ain’t that a real mad fucking world. Everything’s all messed up. Like take—” Wellesley went silent and shook his head. A nurse walked by. “—no, nevermind, man. I don’t want to get you mixed up in anything.”

“Tell me,” Miller implored him.

“Like, well, take—take the President. He says all the right things in public, but that’s only to get elected. If you look at what he’s actually doing, like the policies and the appointments and where he spends *our* money, you can see his true fucking colours.”

Later they talked about revolutions, the American, the French, the Russian, and how if things got too bad the only way out was violence. “But it’s not always like that. The violence doesn’t have to be total. It can be smart, targeted. You take out the right person at the right time and maybe you save a million lives.

“Don’t you agree?” asked Wellesley.

“I guess...”

“Come on—you can be more honest than that. It’s just the two of us here. Two dregs of society that no one gives a shit about.”

“I agree,” said Miller.

Wellesley slapped him on the shoulder. “You know what?”

“What?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

Three months later, much to his surprise, Donald Miller was released from the mental institution he’d spent the last few years in. He even got a little piece of paper that declared him sane. He tried writing Wellesley a few times from the outside, but he never got a response. When he got up the courage to show up at the institution, he was told by a nurse that she shouldn’t be telling him this *but that Wellesley had taken his own life soon after Miller was released.*

Alone again, Donald Miller tried integrating into society, but it was tough going. He couldn’t make friends, and he couldn’t hold down a job. He was a hard worker but always too weird. People didn’t like him, or found him off-putting or creepy, or sometimes they intentionally made his life so unbearable he had to leave, then they pretended they were sorry to see him go. No one ever said anything true or concrete, like, “You stink,” or “You don’t shave regularly enough,” or “Your cologne smells cheap.” It was always merely hinted at, suggested. He was different. He didn’t belong. He felt unwelcome everywhere. His only solace was books, because books never judged him. He realized he hated the world around him, and whenever the President was on television, he hated the President too.

One day, Donald Miller woke up and knew exactly what he needed to do.

After all, he was a bright guy.

It was three weeks before Christmas. The snow was coming down slowly in big white flakes. The mood was magical, and Spector was sitting at a table in an upscale New York City restaurant with his wife and kids, ordering French wine and *magret de canard,* which was just a fancy French term for duck breast. The lighting was low so you could see winter through the big windows. A jazz band was playing something by Duke Ellington. Then the restaurant’s phone rang. Someone picked up. “Yes?” Somebody *whispered.* “Now?” asked the person who’d picked up the call. A commotion began, spreading from the staff to the diners and back to the staff, until someone turned a television on in the kitchen, and someone else dropped a glass, and a woman screamed as the glass shattered and a man yelled, “Oh my God, he’s been shot! The President’s been shot.”

At those words everyone in the restaurant jumped—*everyone but Spector,* who calmly swallowed the duck he’d been chewing, picked up his glass of wine and made a silent toast to the future of the agency.

The dinner was, understandably, cut short, and everyone made their way out to their cars to drive home through the falling snow. In his car, Spector assured his family that everything would be fine. Then he listened without comment as his wife and daughter exchanged uninformed opinions about *who would do such a terrible thing* and *what if we’re under attack* and *maybe it’s the Soviet Union…*

As he pulled into the street on which their hotel was located, Spector noticed a black car with tinted windows idling across from the hotel entrance. 

Passing, he waved, *and the car merged into traffic and drove obediently away.*",2,1762569067.0,libraryofshadows,1,1.0,False

    single dad
    out of work
    2 kids
    please help

He was thirty-four years old.

He'd been homeless for almost two years.

He knocked on a driver's side window and the driver shook her head, not even making eye contact. The next lowered his window and told him to get a fucking job. Sometimes people asked where his kids were while he was out here. It was a fair question. Sometimes they spat at him. Sometimes they got really pissed because they had to work hard for their dime while he was out here begging for it. *A leech on society. A deadbeat. A liar. A fraud, a cheat, a swindler, a drain on the better elements of the world.* But usually they just ignored him. Once in a while they gave him some money, and that was what happened now as a woman distastefully held a ten-dollar bill out the window. “Thank you, ma'am,” said Miller, taking it. “Feed your children,” said the woman. Then the light changed from red to green and the woman drove off. Miller stepped off the street onto the paved shoulder, waited for the next red light, the next group of cars, and repeated.

“It's almost Fordian,” said Spector.

Nevis nodded, pouring coffee from a paper cup into his mouth. “Mhm.”

The pair of them were observing Miller through binoculars from behind the tinted windshield of their black spook car, parked an inconspicuous distance away. Spector continued: “It's like capitalism's chewed him up for so long he's applied capitalist praxis to panhandling. I mean, look: it’s a virtual assembly line, and there he dutifully goes, station to demeaning station, for an entire shift.”

“Yeah,” said Nevis.

The traffic lights changed a few times.

The radio played Janis Joplin.

“So,” said Nevis, holding an empty paper coffee cup, “you sure he's our guy?”

“I'm sure. No wife, no kids, no friends or relatives.”

“Ain't what his sign says.”

“Today.”

“Yeah, today.”

(Yesterday, Miller had been stranded in the city after getting mugged and needed money to get back to Pittsburgh, but that apparently didn't pull as hard on the heartstrings.)

“And you said he was in the army?”

“Sure was.”

“What stripe was he?”

“Didn't get past first, so I wouldn't count on his conditioning too much.”

“Didn't consider him suitable—or what?”

“Got tossed out before they could get the hooks into his head. Couldn't keep his opinions on point or to himself. Spoke his mind. *Independent thinker.*” Nevis grinned. “But there's more. Something I haven't told you. Here,” he said, tossing a fat file folder onto Spector’s lap.

Spector stuck a toothpick in his mouth and looked through the documents.

“Check his school records,” said Nevis.

Spector read them. “Good grades. No disciplinary problems. Straight through to high school graduation.”

“Check the district.”

Spector bit his toothpick so hard it cracked. He spat out the pieces. “This is almost too good. North Mayfield Public School Board, Cincinnati, Ohio—and, oh shit, class of 1952. That's where we test-ran *Idiom*, isn't it?”

“Uh huh,” said Nevis.

Spector picked up his binoculars and watched Miller beg for a few moments.

Nevis continued: “Simplants. False memories. LSD-laced fruit juice. Mass hypnosis. From what I've heard, it was a real fucking mental playground over there.”

“They shut it down in what, fifty-four?”

“Fifty-three. A lot of the guys who worked there went on to *Ultra* and *Monarch*. Some fell off the edge entirely, so you know what that means.”

“And a lot of the subjects ended up dead, or worse—didn't they?”

“Not our guy, though.”

“No.”

“Not yet anyway.” They both laughed, and they soon drove away.

It had started raining, and Donald Miller kept going up to car after car, holding his cardboard sign, now wet and starting to fall apart, collecting spare change from the spared kindness of strangers.

A few days later a black car pulled up to the same intersection. Donald Miller walked up to it and knocked on the driver's side window. Spector was behind the wheel. “Spare any money?” asked Donald Miller, showing his sign, which today said he had one child but that child had a form of cancer whose treatment Miller couldn't afford.

“No, but I can spare you a job,” said Spector.

“A job. *What?*” said Miller.

“Yes. I'm offering you work, Donald.”

“What kind of—hey, how-the-hell do you know my name, huh!”

“Relax, Donald. Get in.”

“No,” said Miller, backing slowly away, almost into another vehicle, whose driver **honked.** Donald jumped. “Don't you want to hear my offer?” asked Spector.

“I don't have the skills for no job, man. Do you think if I had the skills I'd be out here doing this shit?”

“You've already demonstrated the two basic requirements: standing and holding a sign. You're qualified. Now get in the car, please.”

“The *fuck* is this?”

Spector smiled. “Donald, Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office.”

“What, you're fucking crazy, man,” said Miller, his body tensing up, a change coming over his eyes and a self-disbelief over his face. “Who the fuck is—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald. Please get in the car.”

Miller opened his mouth, looked briefly toward the sky, then crossed to the other side of the car, opened the passenger side door, and sat politely beside Spector. When he was settled, Nevis—from the back seat—threw a thick hood over his head and stuck him with a syringe.

Donald Miller woke up naked next to a pile of drab dockworkers’ clothes and a bag of money. He was disoriented, afraid, and about to run when Spector grabbed his arm. “It's all right, Donald,” he said. “You don't need to be afraid. You're in Principal Lewis’ office now. He has a job for you to do. Just put on those clothes.”

“Put them on and do what?”

Miller was looking at the bag of money. He noted
other people here, including a man in a dark suit, and several people with cameras and film equipment. “Like I said before, all you have to do is hold a sign.”

“How come—how come I don't remember coming here? Huh? *Why am I fucking naked?* Hey, man… you fucking kidnapped me didn't you!”

“You're naked because your clothes were so dirty they posed a danger to your health. We took them off. Try to remember: I offered you a job this morning, Donald. You accepted and willingly got in the car with me. You don't remember the ride because you feel asleep. You were very tired. We didn't want to wake you until you were rested.”

Miller breathed heavily. “Job doing what?”

“Holding a sign.”

“OK, and what's the sign say?”

“It doesn't say anything, Donald—completely blank—just as Principal Lewis likes it.”

“And the clothes, do I get to keep the clothes after we're done. Because you took my old clothes, you…”

“You’ll get new clothes,” said Spector.

“And Principal Lewis wants me to put on these clothes and hold the completely blank sign, and then I’ll get paid and get new clothes?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

So, for the next two weeks, Donald Miller put on various kinds of working clothes, held blank signs, sometimes walked, sometimes stood still, sometimes opened his mouth and sometimes closed it, sometimes sat, or lay down on the ground; or on the floor, because he did all these things in different locations, inside and outside: on an empty factory floor, in a muddy field, on a stretch of traffic-less road. And all the while they took photographs of him and filmed him, and he never knew what any of it meant, why he was doing it. They only spoke to give him directions: “Look angry,” “Pretend you’re starving,” “Look like someone’s about to push you in the back,” “like you’re jostling for position,” “like you’ve had enough and you just can’t fucking take it anymore and whatever you want you’re gonna have to fight for it!”

Then it was over.

Spector shook his hand, they bought him a couple of outfits, paid him his money and sent him on his way. “Sorry, we have to do it this way, but—”

Donald Miller found himself at night in a motel room rented under a name he didn’t recognise, with a printed note saying he could stay as long as he liked. He stayed two days before buying a bus ticket back to Cincinnati, where he was from. He lived well there for a while. The money wasn’t insignificant, and he spent it with restraint, but even the new clothes and money couldn’t wipe the stain of homelessness off him, and he couldn’t convince anyone to give him a job. Less than a year later he was back on the streets begging.

The whole episode—because that’s how he thought about it—was clouded by creamy surreality, which just thickened as time went by until it seemed like it had been a dream, as distant as his time in high school.

One day, several years later, Donald Miller was standing outside an electronics shop, the kind with all the new televisions set up in the display window by the street and turned so that all who passed by could see them and watch and marvel and need to have a set of his own. Miller was watching daytime programming on one of the sets when the broadcast *on all the sets,* which had been showing a few different stations—*cut suddenly to a news alert:*

A few people stopped to watch alongside.

“What’s going on?” a man asked.

“I don’t know,” said Miller.

*On the screens, a handsome news reporter was solemnly reading out a statement about anti-government protests happening in some communist country in eastern Europe. “...they marched again today, in the hundreds of thousands, shouting, ‘We want bread! We want freedom!’ and holding signs denouncing the current regime and imploring the West—and the United States specifically—for help.”* There was more, but Miller had stopped listening. There rose a ***thumping-coursing*** followed by a ***ringing*** in his ears. And his eyes were focused on *the faces of the protestors in the photos and clips the news reporter was speaking over:* because they were his face: **all of them were his face!**

“Hey!” Miller yelled.

The people gathered at the electronics store window looked over at him. “You all right there, buddy?” one asked.

“Don’t you see: it’s me.”

“What’s you?”

“There—” He pointed with a shaking finger at one of the television sets. “—me.”

“Which one, honey?” a woman asked, chuckling.

Miller grabbed her by the shoulders, startling her, saying: “All of them. All of them are me.” And, looking back at the set, he started hitting the display window with his hand. “That one and that one, and that one. That one, that one, that one…”

He grew hysterical, violent; but the people on the street worked together to subdue him, and the owner of the electronics store called the police. The police picked him up, asked him a few questions and drove him to a mental institution. They suggested he stay here, “just for a few days, until you’re better,” and when he insisted he didn’t want to stay there, they changed their suggestion to a command backed by the law and threatened him with charges: assault, resisting arrest, loitering, vagrancy.

Donald Miller was in the institution when the President came on the television and in a serious address to the nation declared that the United States of America, a God fearing and freedom loving people, could no longer stand idly by while another people, equally deserving of freedom, yearning for it, was systematically oppressed. Those people, the President said, would now be saved and welcomed into the arms of the West. After that, the President declared war on the country in which Donald Miller had seen himself protesting against the government.

Once the shock of it passed, being committed wasn’t so bad. It was warm, there was free food and free television, and most of the nurses were nice enough. Sure, there were crazies in there, people who’d bang their heads against the wall or speak in made-up languages, but not everyone was like that, and it was easy to avoid the ones who were. The doctors were the worst part: not because they were cruel but because they were cold, and all they ever did was ask questions and make notes and never tell you what the notes were about. Eventually he even confided in one doctor, a young woman named Angeline, and told her the truth about what had happened to him. He talked to Angeline more often after that, which was fine with him. Then, unexpectedly, Angelina was gone and a man with a buzzcut came to talk to him. “Who are you?” Miller asked. “My name’s Fitzsimmons.” “Are you a doctor?” “No, I’m not a doctor. I work for the government.” “What do you want with me?” “To ask you some questions.” “You sound like a doctor, because that’s all they ever do: ask questions.” “Does that mean you won’t answer my questions?” “Can you get me out of here?” “Maybe.” “Depending on my answers?” “That’s right.” “So you’ll answer my questions?” asked Fitzsimmons. “Uh huh,” said Miller. “You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

The questions were bizarre and uncomfortable. Things like, *have you ever tortured an animal?* and *do you masturbate?* and *have you ever had sexual thoughts about someone in your immediate family?* 

Things like that, that almost made you want to dredge your own soul after. At one point, Fitzsimmons placed a dozen pictures of ink blots in front of Miller and asked him *which one of these best describes what you’d feel if I told you Dr. Angeline had been murdered?* When Miller picked one at random because he didn’t understand how what he felt corresponded to what was on the pictures, Fitzsimmons followed up with: *And what part of your body would you feel it in?* “I don’t know.” *Why not?* “Because it hasn’t happened so I haven’t felt it.” *How would you feel if you were the one who murdered her, Donald?* “Why would I do that?” *You murdered her, Donald.* “No.” *Donald, you murdered her and they’re going to put you away for a long long time—and not in a nice place like this but in a real facility with real hardened criminals.* “I didn’t fucking do it!” Miller screamed. “I didn’t fucking kill her! I didn’t—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald.”

Miller’s anger dissipated.

He sat now with his hands crossed calmly on his lap, looking at Fitzsimmons with a kind of blunt stupidity. “Did I do fine?” he asked.

“Yes, Donald. You did fine. Thank you for your patience,” said Fitzsimmons and left.

In the parking lot by the mental institution stood a black spook car with tinted windows. Fitzsimmons crossed from the main facility doors and got in. Spector sat in the driver’s seat. “How’d he do?” Spector asked.

“Borderline,” said Fitzsimmons.

“Explain.”

“It’s not that he couldn’t do it—I think he could. I just don’t have the confidence he’d keep it together afterwards. He’s fundamentally cracked. *All the king’s horses and all the king’s men,* you know?”

“That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as long as he *really* loses it.”

“That part’s manageable.”

“I hate to ask this favour, but you know how things are. The current administation—well, the budget’s just not there, which means the agency’s all about finding efficiencies. In that context, a re-used asset’s a real cost-saver.”

“OK,” said Fitzsimmons. “I’ll recommend it.”

“Thanks,” said Spector.

For Donald Miller, committed life went on. Doctor Angeline never came back, and nothing ever came of the Fitzsimmons interview, so Miller assumed he’d flubbed it. The other patients appeared and disappeared, never making much of an impression. Miller suffered through bouts of anxiety, depression and sometimes difficulty telling truth from fiction. The doctors had cured him of his initial delusion that he was actually hundreds of thousands of people in eastern Europe, but doubts remained. He simply learned to keep them internal. Then life got better. Miller made a friend, a new patient named Wellesley. Wellesley was also from Cincinatti, and the two of them got on splendidly. Finally, Miller had someone to talk to—to *really* talk to. As far as Miller saw it, Wellesley’s only flaw was that he was too interested in politics, always going on about international affairs and domestic policy, and how he hated the communists and hated the current administration for not being hard enough on them, and on internal communists, “because those are the worst, Donny. The scheming little rats that live among us.”

Miller didn’t say much of anything about that kind of stuff at first, but when he realized it made Wellesley happy to be humoured, he humoured him. He started repeating Wellesley’s statements to himself at night, and as he repeated them he started believing them. He read books that Wellesley gave him, smuggled into the institution by an acquaintance, like contraband. “And what’s *that* tell you about this great republic of ours? Land of the free, yet we can’t read everything we want to read.” Miller had never been interested in policy before. Now he learned how he was governed, oppressed, undermined by the enemy within. “There’s even some of that ilk in this hospital,” Wellesley told him one evening. “Some of the doctors and staff—they’re pure reds. I’ve heard them talking in the lounge about unions and racial justice.”

“I thought only poor people were communists,” said Miller.

“That’s what they want you to believe, so that if you ever get real mad about it you’ll turn on your fellow man instead of the real enemy: the one in power. Ain’t that a real mad fucking world. Everything’s all messed up. Like take—” Wellesley went silent and shook his head. A nurse walked by. “—no, nevermind, man. I don’t want to get you mixed up in anything.”

“Tell me,” Miller implored him.

“Like, well, take—take the President. He says all the right things in public, but that’s only to get elected. If you look at what he’s actually doing, like the policies and the appointments and where he spends *our* money, you can see his true fucking colours.”

Later they talked about revolutions, the American, the French, the Russian, and how if things got too bad the only way out was violence. “But it’s not always like that. The violence doesn’t have to be total. It can be smart, targeted. You take out the right person at the right time and maybe you save a million lives.

“Not yet anyway.” They both laughed, and they soon drove away.

It had started raining, and Donald Miller kept going up to car after car, holding his cardboard sign, now wet and starting to fall apart, collecting spare change from the spared kindness of strangers.

A few days later a black car pulled up to the same intersection. Donald Miller walked up to it and knocked on the driver's side window. Spector was behind the wheel. “Spare any money?” asked Donald Miller, showing his sign, which today said he had one child but that child had a form of cancer whose treatment Miller couldn't afford.

“No, but I can spare you a job,” said Spector.

“A job. *What?*” said Miller.

“Yes. I'm offering you work, Donald.”

“What kind of—hey, how-the-hell do you know my name, huh!”

“Relax, Donald. Get in.”

“No,” said Miller, backing slowly away, almost into another vehicle, whose driver **honked.** Donald jumped. “Don't you want to hear my offer?” asked Spector.

“I don't have the skills for no job, man. Do you think if I had the skills I'd be out here doing this shit?”

“You've already demonstrated the two basic requirements: standing and holding a sign. You're qualified. Now get in the car, please.”

“The *fuck* is this?”

Spector smiled. “Donald, Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office.”

“What, you're fucking crazy, man,” said Miller, his body tensing up, a change coming over his eyes and a self-disbelief over his face. “Who the fuck is—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald. Please get in the car.”

Miller opened his mouth, looked briefly toward the sky, then crossed to the other side of the car, opened the passenger side door, and sat politely beside Spector. When he was settled, Nevis—from the back seat—threw a thick hood over his head and stuck him with a syringe.

Donald Miller woke up naked next to a pile of drab dockworkers’ clothes and a bag of money. He was disoriented, afraid, and about to run when Spector grabbed his arm. “It's all right, Donald,” he said. “You don't need to be afraid. You're in Principal Lewis’ office now. He has a job for you to do. Just put on those clothes.”

“Put them on and do what?”

Miller was looking at the bag of money. He noted
other people here, including a man in a dark suit, and several people with cameras and film equipment. “Like I said before, all you have to do is hold a sign.”

“How come—how come I don't remember coming here? Huh? *Why am I fucking naked?* Hey, man… you fucking kidnapped me didn't you!”

“You're naked because your clothes were so dirty they posed a danger to your health. We took them off. Try to remember: I offered you a job this morning, Donald. You accepted and willingly got in the car with me. You don't remember the ride because you feel asleep. You were very tired. We didn't want to wake you until you were rested.”

Miller breathed heavily. “Job doing what?”

“Holding a sign.”

“OK, and what's the sign say?”

“It doesn't say anything, Donald—completely blank—just as Principal Lewis likes it.”

“And the clothes, do I get to keep the clothes after we're done. Because you took my old clothes, you…”

“You’ll get new clothes,” said Spector.

“And Principal Lewis wants me to put on these clothes and hold the completely blank sign, and then I’ll get paid and get new clothes?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

So, for the next two weeks, Donald Miller put on various kinds of working clothes, held blank signs, sometimes walked, sometimes stood still, sometimes opened his mouth and sometimes closed it, sometimes sat, or lay down on the ground; or on the floor, because he did all these things in different locations, inside and outside: on an empty factory floor, in a muddy field, on a stretch of traffic-less road. And all the while they took photographs of him and filmed him, and he never knew what any of it meant, why he was doing it. They only spoke to give him directions: “Look angry,” “Pretend you’re starving,” “Look like someone’s about to push you in the back,” “like you’re jostling for position,” “like you’ve had enough and you just can’t fucking take it anymore and whatever you want you’re gonna have to fight for it!”

Then it was over.

Spector shook his hand, they bought him a couple of outfits, paid him his money and sent him on his way. “Sorry, we have to do it this way, but—”

Donald Miller found himself at night in a motel room rented under a name he didn’t recognise, with a printed note saying he could stay as long as he liked. He stayed two days before buying a bus ticket back to Cincinnati, where he was from. He lived well there for a while. The money wasn’t insignificant, and he spent it with restraint, but even the new clothes and money couldn’t wipe the stain of homelessness off him, and he couldn’t convince anyone to give him a job. Less than a year later he was back on the streets begging.

The whole episode—because that’s how he thought about it—was clouded by creamy surreality, which just thickened as time went by until it seemed like it had been a dream, as distant as his time in high school.

One day, several years later, Donald Miller was standing outside an electronics shop, the kind with all the new televisions set up in the display window by the street and turned so that all who passed by could see them and watch and marvel and need to have a set of his own. Miller was watching daytime programming on one of the sets when the broadcast *on all the sets,* which had been showing a few different stations—*cut suddenly to a news alert:*

A few people stopped to watch alongside.

“What’s going on?” a man asked.

“I don’t know,” said Miller.

*On the screens, a handsome news reporter was solemnly reading out a statement about anti-government protests happening in some communist country in eastern Europe. “...they marched again today, in the hundreds of thousands, shouting, ‘We want bread! We want freedom!’ and holding signs denouncing the current regime and imploring the West—and the United States specifically—for help.”* There was more, but Miller had stopped listening. There rose a ***thumping-coursing*** followed by a ***ringing*** in his ears. And his eyes were focused on *the faces of the protestors in the photos and clips the news reporter was speaking over:* because they were his face: **all of them were his face!**

“Hey!” Miller yelled.

The people gathered at the electronics store window looked over at him. “You all right there, buddy?” one asked.

“Don’t you see: it’s me.”

“What’s you?”

“There—” He pointed with a shaking finger at one of the television sets. “—me.”

“Which one, honey?” a woman asked, chuckling.

Miller grabbed her by the shoulders, startling her, saying: “All of them. All of them are me.” And, looking back at the set, he started hitting the display window with his hand. “That one and that one, and that one. That one, that one, that one…”

He grew hysterical, violent; but the people on the street worked together to subdue him, and the owner of the electronics store called the police. The police picked him up, asked him a few questions and drove him to a mental institution. They suggested he stay here, “just for a few days, until you’re better,” and when he insisted he didn’t want to stay there, they changed their suggestion to a command backed by the law and threatened him with charges: assault, resisting arrest, loitering, vagrancy.

Donald Miller was in the institution when the President came on the television and in a serious address to the nation declared that the United States of America, a God fearing and freedom loving people, could no longer stand idly by while another people, equally deserving of freedom, yearning for it, was systematically oppressed. Those people, the President said, would now be saved and welcomed into the arms of the West. After that, the President declared war on the country in which Donald Miller had seen himself protesting against the government.

Once the shock of it passed, being committed wasn’t so bad. It was warm, there was free food and free television, and most of the nurses were nice enough. Sure, there were crazies in there, people who’d bang their heads against the wall or speak in made-up languages, but not everyone was like that, and it was easy to avoid the ones who were. The doctors were the worst part: not because they were cruel but because they were cold, and all they ever did was ask questions and make notes and never tell you what the notes were about. Eventually he even confided in one doctor, a young woman named Angeline, and told her the truth about what had happened to him. He talked to Angeline more often after that, which was fine with him. Then, unexpectedly, Angelina was gone and a man with a buzzcut came to talk to him. “Who are you?” Miller asked. “My name’s Fitzsimmons.” “Are you a doctor?” “No, I’m not a doctor. I work for the government.” “What do you want with me?” “To ask you some questions.” “You sound like a doctor, because that’s all they ever do: ask questions.” “Does that mean you won’t answer my questions?” “Can you get me out of here?” “Maybe.” “Depending on my answers?” “That’s right.” “So you’ll answer my questions?” asked Fitzsimmons. “Uh huh,” said Miller. “You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

The questions were bizarre and uncomfortable. Things like, *have you ever tortured an animal?* and *do you masturbate?* and *have you ever had sexual thoughts about someone in your immediate family?* 

Things like that, that almost made you want to dredge your own soul after. At one point, Fitzsimmons placed a dozen pictures of ink blots in front of Miller and asked him *which one of these best describes what you’d feel if I told you Dr. Angeline had been murdered?* When Miller picked one at random because he didn’t understand how what he felt corresponded to what was on the pictures, Fitzsimmons followed up with: *And what part of your body would you feel it in?* “I don’t know.” *Why not?* “Because it hasn’t happened so I haven’t felt it.” *How would you feel if you were the one who murdered her, Donald?* “Why would I do that?” *You murdered her, Donald.* “No.” *Donald, you murdered her and they’re going to put you away for a long long time—and not in a nice place like this but in a real facility with real hardened criminals.* “I didn’t fucking do it!” Miller screamed. “I didn’t fucking kill her! I didn’t—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald.”

Miller’s anger dissipated.

He sat now with his hands crossed calmly on his lap, looking at Fitzsimmons with a kind of blunt stupidity. “Did I do fine?” he asked.

“Yes, Donald. You did fine. Thank you for your patience,” said Fitzsimmons and left.

In the parking lot by the mental institution stood a black spook car with tinted windows. Fitzsimmons crossed from the main facility doors and got in. Spector sat in the driver’s seat. “How’d he do?” Spector asked.

“Borderline,” said Fitzsimmons.

“Explain.”

“It’s not that he couldn’t do it—I think he could. I just don’t have the confidence he’d keep it together afterwards. He’s fundamentally cracked. *All the king’s horses and all the king’s men,* you know?”

“That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as long as he *really* loses it.”

“That part’s manageable.”

“I hate to ask this favour, but you know how things are. The current administation—well, the budget’s just not there, which means the agency’s all about finding efficiencies. In that context, a re-used asset’s a real cost-saver.”

“OK,” said Fitzsimmons. “I’ll recommend it.”

“Thanks,” said Spector.

For Donald Miller, committed life went on. Doctor Angeline never came back, and nothing ever came of the Fitzsimmons interview, so Miller assumed he’d flubbed it. The other patients appeared and disappeared, never making much of an impression. Miller suffered through bouts of anxiety, depression and sometimes difficulty telling truth from fiction. The doctors had cured him of his initial delusion that he was actually hundreds of thousands of people in eastern Europe, but doubts remained. He simply learned to keep them internal. Then life got better. Miller made a friend, a new patient named Wellesley. Wellesley was also from Cincinatti, and the two of them got on splendidly. Finally, Miller had someone to talk to—to *really* talk to. As far as Miller saw it, Wellesley’s only flaw was that he was too interested in politics, always going on about international affairs and domestic policy, and how he hated the communists and hated the current administration for not being hard enough on them, and on internal communists, “because those are the worst, Donny. The scheming little rats that live among us.”

Miller didn’t say much of anything about that kind of stuff at first, but when he realized it made Wellesley happy to be humoured, he humoured him. He started repeating Wellesley’s statements to himself at night, and as he repeated them he started believing them. He read books that Wellesley gave him, smuggled into the institution by an acquaintance, like contraband. “And what’s *that* tell you about this great republic of ours? Land of the free, yet we can’t read everything we want to read.” Miller had never been interested in policy before. Now he learned how he was governed, oppressed, undermined by the enemy within. “There’s even some of that ilk in this hospital,” Wellesley told him one evening. “Some of the doctors and staff—they’re pure reds. I’ve heard them talking in the lounge about unions and racial justice.”

“I thought only poor people were communists,” said Miller.

“That’s what they want you to believe, so that if you ever get real mad about it you’ll turn on your fellow man instead of the real enemy: the one in power. Ain’t that a real mad fucking world. Everything’s all messed up. Like take—” Wellesley went silent and shook his head. A nurse walked by. “—no, nevermind, man. I don’t want to get you mixed up in anything.”

“Tell me,” Miller implored him.

“Like, well, take—take the President. He says all the right things in public, but that’s only to get elected. If you look at what he’s actually doing, like the policies and the appointments and where he spends *our* money, you can see his true fucking colours.”

Later they talked about revolutions, the American, the French, the Russian, and how if things got too bad the only way out was violence. “But it’s not always like that. The violence doesn’t have to be total. It can be smart, targeted. You take out the right person at the right time and maybe you save a million lives.

“Don’t you agree?” asked Wellesley.

“I guess...”

“Come on—you can be more honest than that. It’s just the two of us here. Two dregs of society that no one gives a shit about.”

“I agree,” said Miller.

Wellesley slapped him on the shoulder. “You know what?”

“What?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

Three months later, much to his surprise, Donald Miller was released from the mental institution he’d spent the last few years in. He even got a little piece of paper that declared him sane. He tried writing Wellesley a few times from the outside, but he never got a response. When he got up the courage to show up at the institution, he was told by a nurse that she shouldn’t be telling him this *but that Wellesley had taken his own life soon after Miller was released.*

Alone again, Donald Miller tried integrating into society, but it was tough going. He couldn’t make friends, and he couldn’t hold down a job. He was a hard worker but always too weird. People didn’t like him, or found him off-putting or creepy, or sometimes they intentionally made his life so unbearable he had to leave, then they pretended they were sorry to see him go. No one ever said anything true or concrete, like, “You stink,” or “You don’t shave regularly enough,” or “Your cologne smells cheap.” It was always merely hinted at, suggested. He was different. He didn’t belong. He felt unwelcome everywhere. His only solace was books, because books never judged him. He realized he hated the world around him, and whenever the President was on television, he hated the President too.

One day, Donald Miller woke up and knew exactly what he needed to do.

After all, he was a bright guy.

It was three weeks before Christmas. The snow was coming down slowly in big white flakes. The mood was magical, and Spector was sitting at a table in an upscale New York City restaurant with his wife and kids, ordering French wine and *magret de canard,* which was just a fancy French term for duck breast. The lighting was low so you could see winter through the big windows. A jazz band was playing something by Duke Ellington. Then the restaurant’s phone rang. Someone picked up. “Yes?” Somebody *whispered.* “Now?” asked the person who’d picked up the call. A commotion began, spreading from the staff to the diners and back to the staff, until someone turned a television on in the kitchen, and someone else dropped a glass, and a woman screamed as the glass shattered and a man yelled, “Oh my God, he’s been shot! The President’s been shot.”

At those words everyone in the restaurant jumped—*everyone but Spector,* who calmly swallowed the duck he’d been chewing, picked up his glass of wine and made a silent toast to the future of the agency.

The dinner was, understandably, cut short, and everyone made their way out to their cars to drive home through the falling snow. In his car, Spector assured his family that everything would be fine. Then he listened without comment as his wife and daughter exchanged uninformed opinions about *who would do such a terrible thing* and *what if we’re under attack* and *maybe it’s the Soviet Union…*

As he pulled into the street on which their hotel was located, Spector noticed a black car with tinted windows idling across from the hotel entrance. 

Passing, he waved, *and the car merged into traffic and drove obediently away.*",1,1762569035.0,DarkTales,1,1.0,False

1ordrzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/deepnightsociety/comments/1ordrzc/spooks/,Spooks,"It was a busy intersection and the weather was bad, but Donald Miller was out there, knocking on car windows while holding a sign that said:

    single dad
    out of work
    2 kids
    please help

He was thirty-four years old.

He'd been homeless for almost two years.

He knocked on a driver's side window and the driver shook her head, not even making eye contact. The next lowered his window and told him to get a fucking job. Sometimes people asked where his kids were while he was out here. It was a fair question. Sometimes they spat at him. Sometimes they got really pissed because they had to work hard for their dime while he was out here begging for it. *A leech on society. A deadbeat. A liar. A fraud, a cheat, a swindler, a drain on the better elements of the world.* But usually they just ignored him. Once in a while they gave him some money, and that was what happened now as a woman distastefully held a ten-dollar bill out the window. “Thank you, ma'am,” said Miller, taking it. “Feed your children,” said the woman. Then the light changed from red to green and the woman drove off. Miller stepped off the street onto the paved shoulder, waited for the next red light, the next group of cars, and repeated.

“It's almost Fordian,” said Spector.

Nevis nodded, pouring coffee from a paper cup into his mouth. “Mhm.”

The pair of them were observing Miller through binoculars from behind the tinted windshield of their black spook car, parked an inconspicuous distance away. Spector continued: “It's like capitalism's chewed him up for so long he's applied capitalist praxis to panhandling. I mean, look: it’s a virtual assembly line, and there he dutifully goes, station to demeaning station, for an entire shift.”

“Yeah,” said Nevis.

The traffic lights changed a few times.

The radio played Janis Joplin.

“So,” said Nevis, holding an empty paper coffee cup, “you sure he's our guy?”

“I'm sure. No wife, no kids, no friends or relatives.”

“Ain't what his sign says.”

“Today.”

“Yeah, today.”

(Yesterday, Miller had been stranded in the city after getting mugged and needed money to get back to Pittsburgh, but that apparently didn't pull as hard on the heartstrings.)

“And you said he was in the army?”

“Sure was.”

“What stripe was he?”

“Didn't get past first, so I wouldn't count on his conditioning too much.”

“Didn't consider him suitable—or what?”

“Got tossed out before they could get the hooks into his head. Couldn't keep his opinions on point or to himself. Spoke his mind. *Independent thinker.*” Nevis grinned. “But there's more. Something I haven't told you. Here,” he said, tossing a fat file folder onto Spector’s lap.

Spector stuck a toothpick in his mouth and looked through the documents.

“Check his school records,” said Nevis.

Spector read them. “Good grades. No disciplinary problems. Straight through to high school graduation.”

“Check the district.”

Spector bit his toothpick so hard it cracked. He spat out the pieces. “This is almost too good. North Mayfield Public School Board, Cincinnati, Ohio—and, oh shit, class of 1952. That's where we test-ran *Idiom*, isn't it?”

“Uh huh,” said Nevis.

Spector picked up his binoculars and watched Miller beg for a few moments.

Nevis continued: “Simplants. False memories. LSD-laced fruit juice. Mass hypnosis. From what I've heard, it was a real fucking mental playground over there.”

“They shut it down in what, fifty-four?”

“Fifty-three. A lot of the guys who worked there went on to *Ultra* and *Monarch*. Some fell off the edge entirely, so you know what that means.”

“And a lot of the subjects ended up dead, or worse—didn't they?”

“Not our guy, though.”

“No.”

“Not yet anyway.” They both laughed, and they soon drove away.

It had started raining, and Donald Miller kept going up to car after car, holding his cardboard sign, now wet and starting to fall apart, collecting spare change from the spared kindness of strangers.

The doctors were the worst part: not because they were cruel but because they were cold, and all they ever did was ask questions and make notes and never tell you what the notes were about. Eventually he even confided in one doctor, a young woman named Angeline, and told her the truth about what had happened to him. He talked to Angeline more often after that, which was fine with him. Then, unexpectedly, Angelina was gone and a man with a buzzcut came to talk to him. “Who are you?” Miller asked. “My name’s Fitzsimmons.” “Are you a doctor?” “No, I’m not a doctor. I work for the government.” “What do you want with me?” “To ask you some questions.” “You sound like a doctor, because that’s all they ever do: ask questions.” “Does that mean you won’t answer my questions?” “Can you get me out of here?” “Maybe.” “Depending on my answers?” “That’s right.” “So you’ll answer my questions?” asked Fitzsimmons. “Uh huh,” said Miller. “You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

The questions were bizarre and uncomfortable. Things like, *have you ever tortured an animal?* and *do you masturbate?* and *have you ever had sexual thoughts about someone in your immediate family?* 

Things like that, that almost made you want to dredge your own soul after. At one point, Fitzsimmons placed a dozen pictures of ink blots in front of Miller and asked him *which one of these best describes what you’d feel if I told you Dr. Angeline had been murdered?* When Miller picked one at random because he didn’t understand how what he felt corresponded to what was on the pictures, Fitzsimmons followed up with: *And what part of your body would you feel it in?* “I don’t know.” *Why not?* “Because it hasn’t happened so I haven’t felt it.” *How would you feel if you were the one who murdered her, Donald?* “Why would I do that?” *You murdered her, Donald.* “No.” *Donald, you murdered her and they’re going to put you away for a long long time—and not in a nice place like this but in a real facility with real hardened criminals.* “I didn’t fucking do it!” Miller screamed. “I didn’t fucking kill her! I didn’t—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald.”

Miller’s anger dissipated.

He sat now with his hands crossed calmly on his lap, looking at Fitzsimmons with a kind of blunt stupidity. “Did I do fine?” he asked.

“Yes, Donald. You did fine. Thank you for your patience,” said Fitzsimmons and left.

In the parking lot by the mental institution stood a black spook car with tinted windows. Fitzsimmons crossed from the main facility doors and got in. Spector sat in the driver’s seat. “How’d he do?” Spector asked.

“Borderline,” said Fitzsimmons.

“Explain.”

“It’s not that he couldn’t do it—I think he could. I just don’t have the confidence he’d keep it together afterwards. He’s fundamentally cracked. *All the king’s horses and all the king’s men,* you know?”

“That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as long as he *really* loses it.”

“That part’s manageable.”

“I hate to ask this favour, but you know how things are. The current administation—well, the budget’s just not there, which means the agency’s all about finding efficiencies. In that context, a re-used asset’s a real cost-saver.”

“OK,” said Fitzsimmons. “I’ll recommend it.”

“Thanks,” said Spector.

For Donald Miller, committed life went on. Doctor Angeline never came back, and nothing ever came of the Fitzsimmons interview, so Miller assumed he’d flubbed it. The other patients appeared and disappeared, never making much of an impression. Miller suffered through bouts of anxiety, depression and sometimes difficulty telling truth from fiction. The doctors had cured him of his initial delusion that he was actually hundreds of thousands of people in eastern Europe, but doubts remained. He simply learned to keep them internal. Then life got better. Miller made a friend, a new patient named Wellesley. Wellesley was also from Cincinatti, and the two of them got on splendidly. Finally, Miller had someone to talk to—to *really* talk to. As far as Miller saw it, Wellesley’s only flaw was that he was too interested in politics, always going on about international affairs and domestic policy, and how he hated the communists and hated the current administration for not being hard enough on them, and on internal communists, “because those are the worst, Donny. The scheming little rats that live among us.”

Miller didn’t say much of anything about that kind of stuff at first, but when he realized it made Wellesley happy to be humoured, he humoured him. He started repeating Wellesley’s statements to himself at night, and as he repeated them he started believing them. He read books that Wellesley gave him, smuggled into the institution by an acquaintance, like contraband. “And what’s *that* tell you about this great republic of ours? Land of the free, yet we can’t read everything we want to read.” Miller had never been interested in policy before. Now he learned how he was governed, oppressed, undermined by the enemy within. “There’s even some of that ilk in this hospital,” Wellesley told him one evening. “Some of the doctors and staff—they’re pure reds. I’ve heard them talking in the lounge about unions and racial justice.”

“I thought only poor people were communists,” said Miller.

“That’s what they want you to believe, so that if you ever get real mad about it you’ll turn on your fellow man instead of the real enemy: the one in power. Ain’t that a real mad fucking world. Everything’s all messed up. Like take—” Wellesley went silent and shook his head. A nurse walked by. “—no, nevermind, man. I don’t want to get you mixed up in anything.”

“Tell me,” Miller implored him.

“Like, well, take—take the President. He says all the right things in public, but that’s only to get elected. If you look at what he’s actually doing, like the policies and the appointments and where he spends *our* money, you can see his true fucking colours.”

Later they talked about revolutions, the American, the French, the Russian, and how if things got too bad the only way out was violence. “But it’s not always like that. The violence doesn’t have to be total. It can be smart, targeted. You take out the right person at the right time and maybe you save a million lives.

“Don’t you agree?” asked Wellesley.

“I guess...”

“Come on—you can be more honest than that. It’s just the two of us here. Two dregs of society that no one gives a shit about.”

“I agree,” said Miller.

Wellesley slapped him on the shoulder. “You know what?”

“What?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

Three months later, much to his surprise, Donald Miller was released from the mental institution he’d spent the last few years in. He even got a little piece of paper that declared him sane. He tried writing Wellesley a few times from the outside, but he never got a response. When he got up the courage to show up at the institution, he was told by a nurse that she shouldn’t be telling him this *but that Wellesley had taken his own life soon after Miller was released.*

Alone again, Donald Miller tried integrating into society, but it was tough going. He couldn’t make friends, and he couldn’t hold down a job. He was a hard worker but always too weird. People didn’t like him, or found him off-putting or creepy, or sometimes they intentionally made his life so unbearable he had to leave, then they pretended they were sorry to see him go. No one ever said anything true or concrete, like, “You stink,” or “You don’t shave regularly enough,” or “Your cologne smells cheap.” It was always merely hinted at, suggested. He was different. He didn’t belong. He felt unwelcome everywhere. His only solace was books, because books never judged him. He realized he hated the world around him, and whenever the President was on television, he hated the President too.

One day, Donald Miller woke up and knew exactly what he needed to do.

After all, he was a bright guy.

It was three weeks before Christmas. The snow was coming down slowly in big white flakes. The mood was magical, and Spector was sitting at a table in an upscale New York City restaurant with his wife and kids, ordering French wine and *magret de canard,* which was just a fancy French term for duck breast. The lighting was low so you could see winter through the big windows. A jazz band was playing something by Duke Ellington. Then the restaurant’s phone rang. Someone picked up. “Yes?” Somebody *whispered.* “Now?” asked the person who’d picked up the call. A commotion began, spreading from the staff to the diners and back to the staff, until someone turned a television on in the kitchen, and someone else dropped a glass, and a woman screamed as the glass shattered and a man yelled, “Oh my God, he’s been shot! The President’s been shot.”

At those words everyone in the restaurant jumped—*everyone but Spector,* who calmly swallowed the duck he’d been chewing, picked up his glass of wine and made a silent toast to the future of the agency.

The dinner was, understandably, cut short, and everyone made their way out to their cars to drive home through the falling snow. In his car, Spector assured his family that everything would be fine. Then he listened without comment as his wife and daughter exchanged uninformed opinions about *who would do such a terrible thing* and *what if we’re under attack* and *maybe it’s the Soviet Union…*

As he pulled into the street on which their hotel was located, Spector noticed a black car with tinted windows idling across from the hotel entrance. 

Passing, he waved, *and the car merged into traffic and drove obediently away.*",1,1762569019.0,deepnightsociety,1,1.0,False

Back in Sydney, they’d start screaming at 6AM like they were arguing over a Macca’s chip. You’d try to have a peaceful morning coffee and they’d be up there, absolutely losing it for no reason. I used to think they were the most annoying part of the city.

Now in Perth, it’s quiet. Peaceful. The skies are calm, mornings are gentle — and weirdly, I kind of hate it. Haven’t seen a single cockatoo since I got here, and I miss the background chaos, the personality, the noise that somehow made the place feel alive.

1ordrrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1ordrrg/spooks/,Spooks,"It was a busy intersection and the weather was bad, but Donald Miller was out there, knocking on car windows while holding a sign that said:

    single dad
    out of work
    2 kids
    please help

He was thirty-four years old.

He'd been homeless for almost two years.

He knocked on a driver's side window and the driver shook her head, not even making eye contact. The next lowered his window and told him to get a fucking job. Sometimes people asked where his kids were while he was out here. It was a fair question. Sometimes they spat at him. Sometimes they got really pissed because they had to work hard for their dime while he was out here begging for it. *A leech on society. A deadbeat. A liar. A fraud, a cheat, a swindler, a drain on the better elements of the world.* But usually they just ignored him. Once in a while they gave him some money, and that was what happened now as a woman distastefully held a ten-dollar bill out the window. “Thank you, ma'am,” said Miller, taking it. “Feed your children,” said the woman. Then the light changed from red to green and the woman drove off. Miller stepped off the street onto the paved shoulder, waited for the next red light, the next group of cars, and repeated.

“It's almost Fordian,” said Spector.

Nevis nodded, pouring coffee from a paper cup into his mouth. “Mhm.”

The pair of them were observing Miller through binoculars from behind the tinted windshield of their black spook car, parked an inconspicuous distance away. Spector continued: “It's like capitalism's chewed him up for so long he's applied capitalist praxis to panhandling. I mean, look: it’s a virtual assembly line, and there he dutifully goes, station to demeaning station, for an entire shift.”

“Yeah,” said Nevis.

The traffic lights changed a few times.

The radio played Janis Joplin.

“So,” said Nevis, holding an empty paper coffee cup, “you sure he's our guy?”

“I'm sure. No wife, no kids, no friends or relatives.”

“Ain't what his sign says.”

“Today.”

“Yeah, today.”

(Yesterday, Miller had been stranded in the city after getting mugged and needed money to get back to Pittsburgh, but that apparently didn't pull as hard on the heartstrings.)

“And you said he was in the army?”

“Sure was.”

“What stripe was he?”

“Didn't get past first, so I wouldn't count on his conditioning too much.”

“Didn't consider him suitable—or what?”

“Got tossed out before they could get the hooks into his head. Couldn't keep his opinions on point or to himself. Spoke his mind. *Independent thinker.*” Nevis grinned. “But there's more. Something I haven't told you. Here,” he said, tossing a fat file folder onto Spector’s lap.

Spector stuck a toothpick in his mouth and looked through the documents.

“Check his school records,” said Nevis.

Spector read them. “Good grades. No disciplinary problems. Straight through to high school graduation.”

“Check the district.”

Spector bit his toothpick so hard it cracked. He spat out the pieces. “This is almost too good. North Mayfield Public School Board, Cincinnati, Ohio—and, oh shit, class of 1952. That's where we test-ran *Idiom*, isn't it?”

“Uh huh,” said Nevis.

Spector picked up his binoculars and watched Miller beg for a few moments.

Nevis continued: “Simplants. False memories. LSD-laced fruit juice. Mass hypnosis. From what I've heard, it was a real fucking mental playground over there.”

“They shut it down in what, fifty-four?”

“Fifty-three. A lot of the guys who worked there went on to *Ultra* and *Monarch*. Some fell off the edge entirely, so you know what that means.”

“And a lot of the subjects ended up dead, or worse—didn't they?”

“Not our guy, though.”

“No.”

“Not yet anyway.” They both laughed, and they soon drove away.

It had started raining, and Donald Miller kept going up to car after car, holding his cardboard sign, now wet and starting to fall apart, collecting spare change from the spared kindness of strangers.

A few days later a black car pulled up to the same intersection. Donald Miller walked up to it and knocked on the driver's side window. Spector was behind the wheel. “Spare any money?” asked Donald Miller, showing his sign, which today said he had one child but that child had a form of cancer whose treatment Miller couldn't afford.

“No, but I can spare you a job,” said Spector.

“A job. *What?*” said Miller.

“Yes. I'm offering you work, Donald.”

“What kind of—hey, how-the-hell do you know my name, huh!”

“Relax, Donald. Get in.”

“No,” said Miller, backing slowly away, almost into another vehicle, whose driver **honked.** Donald jumped. “Don't you want to hear my offer?” asked Spector.

“I don't have the skills for no job, man. Do you think if I had the skills I'd be out here doing this shit?”

“You've already demonstrated the two basic requirements: standing and holding a sign. You're qualified. Now get in the car, please.”

“The *fuck* is this?”

Spector smiled. “Donald, Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office.”

“What, you're fucking crazy, man,” said Miller, his body tensing up, a change coming over his eyes and a self-disbelief over his face. “Who the fuck is—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald. Please get in the car.”

Miller opened his mouth, looked briefly toward the sky, then crossed to the other side of the car, opened the passenger side door, and sat politely beside Spector. When he was settled, Nevis—from the back seat—threw a thick hood over his head and stuck him with a syringe.

Donald Miller woke up naked next to a pile of drab dockworkers’ clothes and a bag of money. He was disoriented, afraid, and about to run when Spector grabbed his arm. “It's all right, Donald,” he said. “You don't need to be afraid. You're in Principal Lewis’ office now. He has a job for you to do. Just put on those clothes.”

“Put them on and do what?”

Miller was looking at the bag of money. He noted
other people here, including a man in a dark suit, and several people with cameras and film equipment. “Like I said before, all you have to do is hold a sign.”

“How come—how come I don't remember coming here? Huh? *Why am I fucking naked?* Hey, man… you fucking kidnapped me didn't you!”

“You're naked because your clothes were so dirty they posed a danger to your health. We took them off. Try to remember: I offered you a job this morning, Donald. You accepted and willingly got in the car with me. You don't remember the ride because you feel asleep. You were very tired. We didn't want to wake you until you were rested.”

Miller breathed heavily. “Job doing what?”

“Holding a sign.”

“OK, and what's the sign say?”

“It doesn't say anything, Donald—completely blank—just as Principal Lewis likes it.”

“And the clothes, do I get to keep the clothes after we're done. Because you took my old clothes, you…”

“You’ll get new clothes,” said Spector.

“And Principal Lewis wants me to put on these clothes and hold the completely blank sign, and then I’ll get paid and get new clothes?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

So, for the next two weeks, Donald Miller put on various kinds of working clothes, held blank signs, sometimes walked, sometimes stood still, sometimes opened his mouth and sometimes closed it, sometimes sat, or lay down on the ground; or on the floor, because he did all these things in different locations, inside and outside: on an empty factory floor, in a muddy field, on a stretch of traffic-less road. And all the while they took photographs of him and filmed him, and he never knew what any of it meant, why he was doing it. They only spoke to give him directions: “Look angry,” “Pretend you’re starving,” “Look like someone’s about to push you in the back,” “like you’re jostling for position,” “like you’ve had enough and you just can’t fucking take it anymore and whatever you want you’re gonna have to fight for it!”

Then it was over.

Spector shook his hand, they bought him a couple of outfits, paid him his money and sent him on his way. “Sorry, we have to do it this way, but—”

Donald Miller found himself at night in a motel room rented under a name he didn’t recognise, with a printed note saying he could stay as long as he liked. He stayed two days before buying a bus ticket back to Cincinnati, where he was from. He lived well there for a while. The money wasn’t insignificant, and he spent it with restraint, but even the new clothes and money couldn’t wipe the stain of homelessness off him, and he couldn’t convince anyone to give him a job. Less than a year later he was back on the streets begging.

The whole episode—because that’s how he thought about it—was clouded by creamy surreality, which just thickened as time went by until it seemed like it had been a dream, as distant as his time in high school.

One day, several years later, Donald Miller was standing outside an electronics shop, the kind with all the new televisions set up in the display window by the street and turned so that all who passed by could see them and watch and marvel and need to have a set of his own. Miller was watching daytime programming on one of the sets when the broadcast *on all the sets,* which had been showing a few different stations—*cut suddenly to a news alert:*

A few people stopped to watch alongside.

“What’s going on?” a man asked.

“I don’t know,” said Miller.

*On the screens, a handsome news reporter was solemnly reading out a statement about anti-government protests happening in some communist country in eastern Europe. “...they marched again today, in the hundreds of thousands, shouting, ‘We want bread! We want freedom!’ and holding signs denouncing the current regime and imploring the West—and the United States specifically—for help.”* There was more, but Miller had stopped listening. There rose a ***thumping-coursing*** followed by a ***ringing*** in his ears. And his eyes were focused on *the faces of the protestors in the photos and clips the news reporter was speaking over:* because they were his face: **all of them were his face!**

“Hey!” Miller yelled.

The people gathered at the electronics store window looked over at him. “You all right there, buddy?” one asked.

“Don’t you see: it’s me.”

“What’s you?”

“There—” He pointed with a shaking finger at one of the television sets. “—me.”

“Which one, honey?” a woman asked, chuckling.

Miller grabbed her by the shoulders, startling her, saying: “All of them. All of them are me.” And, looking back at the set, he started hitting the display window with his hand. “That one and that one, and that one. That one, that one, that one…”

He grew hysterical, violent; but the people on the street worked together to subdue him, and the owner of the electronics store called the police. The police picked him up, asked him a few questions and drove him to a mental institution. They suggested he stay here, “just for a few days, until you’re better,” and when he insisted he didn’t want to stay there, they changed their suggestion to a command backed by the law and threatened him with charges: assault, resisting arrest, loitering, vagrancy.

Donald Miller was in the institution when the President came on the television and in a serious address to the nation declared that the United States of America, a God fearing and freedom loving people, could no longer stand idly by while another people, equally deserving of freedom, yearning for it, was systematically oppressed. Those people, the President said, would now be saved and welcomed into the arms of the West. After that, the President declared war on the country in which Donald Miller had seen himself protesting against the government.

Once the shock of it passed, being committed wasn’t so bad. It was warm, there was free food and free television, and most of the nurses were nice enough. Sure, there were crazies in there, people who’d bang their heads against the wall or speak in made-up languages, but not everyone was like that, and it was easy to avoid the ones who were. The doctors were the worst part: not because they were cruel but because they were cold, and all they ever did was ask questions and make notes and never tell you what the notes were about. Eventually he even confided in one doctor, a young woman named Angeline, and told her the truth about what had happened to him. He talked to Angeline more often after that, which was fine with him. Then, unexpectedly, Angelina was gone and a man with a buzzcut came to talk to him. “Who are you?” Miller asked. “My name’s Fitzsimmons.” “Are you a doctor?” “No, I’m not a doctor. I work for the government.” “What do you want with me?” “To ask you some questions.” “You sound like a doctor, because that’s all they ever do: ask questions.” “Does that mean you won’t answer my questions?” “Can you get me out of here?” “Maybe.” “Depending on my answers?” “That’s right.” “So you’ll answer my questions?” asked Fitzsimmons. “Uh huh,” said Miller. “You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

The questions were bizarre and uncomfortable. Things like, *have you ever tortured an animal?* and *do you masturbate?* and *have you ever had sexual thoughts about someone in your immediate family?* 

Things like that, that almost made you want to dredge your own soul after. At one point, Fitzsimmons placed a dozen pictures of ink blots in front of Miller and asked him *which one of these best describes what you’d feel if I told you Dr. Angeline had been murdered?* When Miller picked one at random because he didn’t understand how what he felt corresponded to what was on the pictures, Fitzsimmons followed up with: *And what part of your body would you feel it in?* “I don’t know.” *Why not?* “Because it hasn’t happened so I haven’t felt it.” *How would you feel if you were the one who murdered her, Donald?* “Why would I do that?” *You murdered her, Donald.* “No.” *Donald, you murdered her and they’re going to put you away for a long long time—and not in a nice place like this but in a real facility with real hardened criminals.* “I didn’t fucking do it!” Miller screamed. “I didn’t fucking kill her! I didn’t—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald.”

Miller’s anger dissipated.

He sat now with his hands crossed calmly on his lap, looking at Fitzsimmons with a kind of blunt stupidity. “Did I do fine?” he asked.

“Yes, Donald. You did fine. Thank you for your patience,” said Fitzsimmons and left.

In the parking lot by the mental institution stood a black spook car with tinted windows. Fitzsimmons crossed from the main facility doors and got in. Spector sat in the driver’s seat. “How’d he do?” Spector asked.

“Borderline,” said Fitzsimmons.

“Explain.”

“It’s not that he couldn’t do it—I think he could. I just don’t have the confidence he’d keep it together afterwards. He’s fundamentally cracked. *All the king’s horses and all the king’s men,* you know?”

1ordri6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ordri6/aitah_for_setting_boundaries_with_my_wife/,AITAH for setting boundaries with my wife,"My wife(30) and I(34) have been married for 5 years, but have known each other since kids. Shortly after we got married, she told me that she is bi-polar and hid that from me until we got married because ""I didnt want you leaving."" I have been called names, ""youre a shifty father"" etc etc during her anger moments. 2 years ago she was admitted and diagnosed with Bi-polar and BPD. In the last 6 months, we have been struggling alot. 

Yesterday when I got off work, she was making moves on me. Teasing me until the kids went to bed. When they went to bed, we both had our own time to whine down. She asked me to come upstairs to bed and watch shows, and I agreed. An hour later, I asked her if/when things were going to ""Happen"" as I was getting tired. She said she wasn't feeling it. Normally I'd be fine with that answer, but Ive been communicating for months now if she could atleast plan and/or make a move so I could feel desired too, because normally its me planning it all. Anyways, shortly after that, I asked her if she just wanted to bath and go to bed. She agreed. Once we got into the bathroom, she asked if something was wrong. I told her I was a bit upset and sad that everytime she promises and plans something like that, which has happened for 6 months now, she sabotages it one way or the other. 

She got angry and defensive because I said I was upset. Told me I shouldn't feel that way. I told her I wasn't mad and just wanted to have a conversation, which made her more angry. I went to bed feeling anxious.

In the morning when we woke up, she was all happy and lovey. Trying to make me happy with buying me breakfast and coffee. She made a comment ""Are you still butthurt over me overreacting last night?"" I said I was still a bit upset, but making comments like that only makes things worse(which she makes often). She made a few comments under her breath and then said I'll give your space today. I agreed. I left work early today to drive her to her doctors appointment. When I got home to get her, she didnt say a word to me. She was very angry. I was trying to be supportive and even attended her appointment with her. She was very rude and combative. I asked her what she wanted for lunch and she gave me an awful look and said ""Im not hungry."" So I got myself lunch. The whole ride home until now, she hasn't looked at me and has been extremely rude to me, especially infront of the kids. She asked me to go get her a Starbucks after this tonight, and I declined stating why should I do something nice for you when you can't even respect me. ",4,1762568982.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False
1ordrcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1ordrcs/spooks/,Spooks,"It was a busy intersection and the weather was bad, but Donald Miller was out there, knocking on car windows while holding a sign that said:

    single dad
    out of work
    2 kids
    please help

He was thirty-four years old.

He'd been homeless for almost two years.

He knocked on a driver's side window and the driver shook her head, not even making eye contact. The next lowered his window and told him to get a fucking job. Sometimes people asked where his kids were while he was out here. It was a fair question. Sometimes they spat at him. Sometimes they got really pissed because they had to work hard for their dime while he was out here begging for it. *A leech on society. A deadbeat. A liar. A fraud, a cheat, a swindler, a drain on the better elements of the world.* But usually they just ignored him. Once in a while they gave him some money, and that was what happened now as a woman distastefully held a ten-dollar bill out the window. “Thank you, ma'am,” said Miller, taking it. “Feed your children,” said the woman. Then the light changed from red to green and the woman drove off. Miller stepped off the street onto the paved shoulder, waited for the next red light, the next group of cars, and repeated.

“It's almost Fordian,” said Spector.

Nevis nodded, pouring coffee from a paper cup into his mouth. “Mhm.”

The pair of them were observing Miller through binoculars from behind the tinted windshield of their black spook car, parked an inconspicuous distance away. Spector continued: “It's like capitalism's chewed him up for so long he's applied capitalist praxis to panhandling. I mean, look: it’s a virtual assembly line, and there he dutifully goes, station to demeaning station, for an entire shift.”

“Yeah,” said Nevis.

The traffic lights changed a few times.

The radio played Janis Joplin.

“So,” said Nevis, holding an empty paper coffee cup, “you sure he's our guy?”

“I'm sure. No wife, no kids, no friends or relatives.”

“Ain't what his sign says.”

“Today.”

“Yeah, today.”

(Yesterday, Miller had been stranded in the city after getting mugged and needed money to get back to Pittsburgh, but that apparently didn't pull as hard on the heartstrings.)

“And you said he was in the army?”

“Sure was.”

“What stripe was he?”

“Didn't get past first, so I wouldn't count on his conditioning too much.”

“Didn't consider him suitable—or what?”

“Got tossed out before they could get the hooks into his head. Couldn't keep his opinions on point or to himself. Spoke his mind. *Independent thinker.*” Nevis grinned. “But there's more. Something I haven't told you. Here,” he said, tossing a fat file folder onto Spector’s lap.

Spector stuck a toothpick in his mouth and looked through the documents.

“Check his school records,” said Nevis.

Spector read them. “Good grades. No disciplinary problems. Straight through to high school graduation.”

“Check the district.”

Spector bit his toothpick so hard it cracked. He spat out the pieces. “This is almost too good. North Mayfield Public School Board, Cincinnati, Ohio—and, oh shit, class of 1952. That's where we test-ran *Idiom*, isn't it?”

“Uh huh,” said Nevis.

Spector picked up his binoculars and watched Miller beg for a few moments.

Nevis continued: “Simplants. False memories. LSD-laced fruit juice. Mass hypnosis. From what I've heard, it was a real fucking mental playground over there.”

“They shut it down in what, fifty-four?”

“Fifty-three. A lot of the guys who worked there went on to *Ultra* and *Monarch*. Some fell off the edge entirely, so you know what that means.”

“And a lot of the subjects ended up dead, or worse—didn't they?”

“Not our guy, though.”

“No.”

“Not yet anyway.” They both laughed, and they soon drove away.

It had started raining, and Donald Miller kept going up to car after car, holding his cardboard sign, now wet and starting to fall apart, collecting spare change from the spared kindness of strangers.

A few days later a black car pulled up to the same intersection. Donald Miller walked up to it and knocked on the driver's side window. Spector was behind the wheel. “Spare any money?” asked Donald Miller, showing his sign, which today said he had one child but that child had a form of cancer whose treatment Miller couldn't afford.

“No, but I can spare you a job,” said Spector.

“A job. *What?*” said Miller.

“Yes. I'm offering you work, Donald.”

“What kind of—hey, how-the-hell do you know my name, huh!”

“Relax, Donald. Get in.”

“No,” said Miller, backing slowly away, almost into another vehicle, whose driver **honked.** Donald jumped. “Don't you want to hear my offer?” asked Spector.

“I don't have the skills for no job, man. Do you think if I had the skills I'd be out here doing this shit?”

“You've already demonstrated the two basic requirements: standing and holding a sign. You're qualified. Now get in the car, please.”

“The *fuck* is this?”

Spector smiled. “Donald, Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office.”

“What, you're fucking crazy, man,” said Miller, his body tensing up, a change coming over his eyes and a self-disbelief over his face. “Who the fuck is—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald. Please get in the car.”

Miller opened his mouth, looked briefly toward the sky, then crossed to the other side of the car, opened the passenger side door, and sat politely beside Spector. When he was settled, Nevis—from the back seat—threw a thick hood over his head and stuck him with a syringe.

Donald Miller woke up naked next to a pile of drab dockworkers’ clothes and a bag of money. He was disoriented, afraid, and about to run when Spector grabbed his arm. “It's all right, Donald,” he said. “You don't need to be afraid. You're in Principal Lewis’ office now. He has a job for you to do. Just put on those clothes.”

“Put them on and do what?”

Miller was looking at the bag of money. He noted
other people here, including a man in a dark suit, and several people with cameras and film equipment. “Like I said before, all you have to do is hold a sign.”

“How come—how come I don't remember coming here? Huh? *Why am I fucking naked?* Hey, man… you fucking kidnapped me didn't you!”

“You're naked because your clothes were so dirty they posed a danger to your health. We took them off. Try to remember: I offered you a job this morning, Donald. You accepted and willingly got in the car with me. You don't remember the ride because you feel asleep. You were very tired. We didn't want to wake you until you were rested.”

Miller breathed heavily. “Job doing what?”

“Holding a sign.”

“OK, and what's the sign say?”

“It doesn't say anything, Donald—completely blank—just as Principal Lewis likes it.”

“And the clothes, do I get to keep the clothes after we're done. Because you took my old clothes, you…”

“You’ll get new clothes,” said Spector.

“And Principal Lewis wants me to put on these clothes and hold the completely blank sign, and then I’ll get paid and get new clothes?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

So, for the next two weeks, Donald Miller put on various kinds of working clothes, held blank signs, sometimes walked, sometimes stood still, sometimes opened his mouth and sometimes closed it, sometimes sat, or lay down on the ground; or on the floor, because he did all these things in different locations, inside and outside: on an empty factory floor, in a muddy field, on a stretch of traffic-less road. And all the while they took photographs of him and filmed him, and he never knew what any of it meant, why he was doing it. They only spoke to give him directions: “Look angry,” “Pretend you’re starving,” “Look like someone’s about to push you in the back,” “like you’re jostling for position,” “like you’ve had enough and you just can’t fucking take it anymore and whatever you want you’re gonna have to fight for it!”

Then it was over.

Spector shook his hand, they bought him a couple of outfits, paid him his money and sent him on his way. “Sorry, we have to do it this way, but—”

Donald Miller found himself at night in a motel room rented under a name he didn’t recognise, with a printed note saying he could stay as long as he liked. He stayed two days before buying a bus ticket back to Cincinnati, where he was from. He lived well there for a while. The money wasn’t insignificant, and he spent it with restraint, but even the new clothes and money couldn’t wipe the stain of homelessness off him, and he couldn’t convince anyone to give him a job. Less than a year later he was back on the streets begging.

The whole episode—because that’s how he thought about it—was clouded by creamy surreality, which just thickened as time went by until it seemed like it had been a dream, as distant as his time in high school.

One day, several years later, Donald Miller was standing outside an electronics shop, the kind with all the new televisions set up in the display window by the street and turned so that all who passed by could see them and watch and marvel and need to have a set of his own. Miller was watching daytime programming on one of the sets when the broadcast *on all the sets,* which had been showing a few different stations—*cut suddenly to a news alert:*

A few people stopped to watch alongside.

“What’s going on?” a man asked.

“I don’t know,” said Miller.

*On the screens, a handsome news reporter was solemnly reading out a statement about anti-government protests happening in some communist country in eastern Europe. “...they marched again today, in the hundreds of thousands, shouting, ‘We want bread! We want freedom!’ and holding signs denouncing the current regime and imploring the West—and the United States specifically—for help.”* There was more, but Miller had stopped listening. There rose a ***thumping-coursing*** followed by a ***ringing*** in his ears. And his eyes were focused on *the faces of the protestors in the photos and clips the news reporter was speaking over:* because they were his face: **all of them were his face!**

“Hey!” Miller yelled.

The people gathered at the electronics store window looked over at him. “You all right there, buddy?” one asked.

“Don’t you see: it’s me.”

“What’s you?”

“There—” He pointed with a shaking finger at one of the television sets. “—me.”

“Which one, honey?” a woman asked, chuckling.

Miller grabbed her by the shoulders, startling her, saying: “All of them. All of them are me.” And, looking back at the set, he started hitting the display window with his hand. “That one and that one, and that one. That one, that one, that one…”

He grew hysterical, violent; but the people on the street worked together to subdue him, and the owner of the electronics store called the police. The police picked him up, asked him a few questions and drove him to a mental institution. They suggested he stay here, “just for a few days, until you’re better,” and when he insisted he didn’t want to stay there, they changed their suggestion to a command backed by the law and threatened him with charges: assault, resisting arrest, loitering, vagrancy.

Donald Miller was in the institution when the President came on the television and in a serious address to the nation declared that the United States of America, a God fearing and freedom loving people, could no longer stand idly by while another people, equally deserving of freedom, yearning for it, was systematically oppressed. Those people, the President said, would now be saved and welcomed into the arms of the West. After that, the President declared war on the country in which Donald Miller had seen himself protesting against the government.

Once the shock of it passed, being committed wasn’t so bad. It was warm, there was free food and free television, and most of the nurses were nice enough. Sure, there were crazies in there, people who’d bang their heads against the wall or speak in made-up languages, but not everyone was like that, and it was easy to avoid the ones who were. The doctors were the worst part: not because they were cruel but because they were cold, and all they ever did was ask questions and make notes and never tell you what the notes were about. Eventually he even confided in one doctor, a young woman named Angeline, and told her the truth about what had happened to him. He talked to Angeline more often after that, which was fine with him. Then, unexpectedly, Angelina was gone and a man with a buzzcut came to talk to him. “Who are you?” Miller asked. “My name’s Fitzsimmons.” “Are you a doctor?” “No, I’m not a doctor. I work for the government.” “What do you want with me?” “To ask you some questions.” “You sound like a doctor, because that’s all they ever do: ask questions.” “Does that mean you won’t answer my questions?” “Can you get me out of here?” “Maybe.” “Depending on my answers?” “That’s right.” “So you’ll answer my questions?” asked Fitzsimmons. “Uh huh,” said Miller. “You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

The questions were bizarre and uncomfortable. Things like, *have you ever tortured an animal?* and *do you masturbate?* and *have you ever had sexual thoughts about someone in your immediate family?* 

Things like that, that almost made you want to dredge your own soul after. At one point, Fitzsimmons placed a dozen pictures of ink blots in front of Miller and asked him *which one of these best describes what you’d feel if I told you Dr. Angeline had been murdered?* When Miller picked one at random because he didn’t understand how what he felt corresponded to what was on the pictures, Fitzsimmons followed up with: *And what part of your body would you feel it in?* “I don’t know.” *Why not?* “Because it hasn’t happened so I haven’t felt it.” *How would you feel if you were the one who murdered her, Donald?* “Why would I do that?” *You murdered her, Donald.* “No.” *Donald, you murdered her and they’re going to put you away for a long long time—and not in a nice place like this but in a real facility with real hardened criminals.* “I didn’t fucking do it!” Miller screamed. “I didn’t fucking kill her! I didn’t—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald.”

Miller’s anger dissipated.

He sat now with his hands crossed calmly on his lap, looking at Fitzsimmons with a kind of blunt stupidity. “Did I do fine?” he asked.

“Yes, Donald. You did fine. Thank you for your patience,” said Fitzsimmons and left.

In the parking lot by the mental institution stood a black spook car with tinted windows. Fitzsimmons crossed from the main facility doors and got in. Spector sat in the driver’s seat. “How’d he do?” Spector asked.

“Borderline,” said Fitzsimmons.

“Explain.”

“It’s not that he couldn’t do it—I think he could. I just don’t have the confidence he’d keep it together afterwards. He’s fundamentally cracked. *All the king’s horses and all the king’s men,* you know?”

“That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as long as he *really* loses it.”

“That part’s manageable.”

“I hate to ask this favour, but you know how things are. The current administation—well, the budget’s just not there, which means the agency’s all about finding efficiencies. In that context, a re-used asset’s a real cost-saver.”

“OK,” said Fitzsimmons. “I’ll recommend it.”

“Thanks,” said Spector.

For Donald Miller, committed life went on. Doctor Angeline never came back, and nothing ever came of the Fitzsimmons interview, so Miller assumed he’d flubbed it. The other patients appeared and disappeared, never making much of an impression. Miller suffered through bouts of anxiety, depression and sometimes difficulty telling truth from fiction. The doctors had cured him of his initial delusion that he was actually hundreds of thousands of people in eastern Europe, but doubts remained. He simply learned to keep them internal. Then life got better. Miller made a friend, a new patient named Wellesley. Wellesley was also from Cincinatti, and the two of them got on splendidly. Finally, Miller had someone to talk to—to *really* talk to. As far as Miller saw it, Wellesley’s only flaw was that he was too interested in politics, always going on about international affairs and domestic policy, and how he hated the communists and hated the current administration for not being hard enough on them, and on internal communists, “because those are the worst, Donny. The scheming little rats that live among us.”

Miller didn’t say much of anything about that kind of stuff at first, but when he realized it made Wellesley happy to be humoured, he humoured him. He started repeating Wellesley’s statements to himself at night, and as he repeated them he started believing them. He read books that Wellesley gave him, smuggled into the institution by an acquaintance, like contraband. “And what’s *that* tell you about this great republic of ours? Land of the free, yet we can’t read everything we want to read.” Miller had never been interested in policy before. Now he learned how he was governed, oppressed, undermined by the enemy within. “There’s even some of that ilk in this hospital,” Wellesley told him one evening. “Some of the doctors and staff—they’re pure reds. I’ve heard them talking in the lounge about unions and racial justice.”

“I thought only poor people were communists,” said Miller.

“That’s what they want you to believe, so that if you ever get real mad about it you’ll turn on your fellow man instead of the real enemy: the one in power. Ain’t that a real mad fucking world. Everything’s all messed up. Like take—” Wellesley went silent and shook his head. A nurse walked by. “—no, nevermind, man. I don’t want to get you mixed up in anything.”

“Tell me,” Miller implored him.

“Like, well, take—take the President. He says all the right things in public, but that’s only to get elected. If you look at what he’s actually doing, like the policies and the appointments and where he spends *our* money, you can see his true fucking colours.”

Later they talked about revolutions, the American, the French, the Russian, and how if things got too bad the only way out was violence. “But it’s not always like that. The violence doesn’t have to be total. It can be smart, targeted. You take out the right person at the right time and maybe you save a million lives.

“Don’t you agree?” asked Wellesley.

“I guess...”

“Come on—you can be more honest than that. It’s just the two of us here. Two dregs of society that no one gives a shit about.”

“I agree,” said Miller.

Wellesley slapped him on the shoulder. “You know what?”

“What?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

Three months later, much to his surprise, Donald Miller was released from the mental institution he’d spent the last few years in. He even got a little piece of paper that declared him sane. He tried writing Wellesley a few times from the outside, but he never got a response. When he got up the courage to show up at the institution, he was told by a nurse that she shouldn’t be telling him this *but that Wellesley had taken his own life soon after Miller was released.*

Alone again, Donald Miller tried integrating into society, but it was tough going. He couldn’t make friends, and he couldn’t hold down a job. He was a hard worker but always too weird. People didn’t like him, or found him off-putting or creepy, or sometimes they intentionally made his life so unbearable he had to leave, then they pretended they were sorry to see him go. No one ever said anything true or concrete, like, “You stink,” or “You don’t shave regularly enough,” or “Your cologne smells cheap.” It was always merely hinted at, suggested. He was different. He didn’t belong. He felt unwelcome everywhere. His only solace was books, because books never judged him. He realized he hated the world around him, and whenever the President was on television, he hated the President too.

One day, Donald Miller woke up and knew exactly what he needed to do.

After all, he was a bright guy.

It was three weeks before Christmas. The snow was coming down slowly in big white flakes. The mood was magical, and Spector was sitting at a table in an upscale New York City restaurant with his wife and kids, ordering French wine and *magret de canard,* which was just a fancy French term for duck breast. The lighting was low so you could see winter through the big windows. A jazz band was playing something by Duke Ellington. Then the restaurant’s phone rang. Someone picked up. “Yes?” Somebody *whispered.* “Now?” asked the person who’d picked up the call. A commotion began, spreading from the staff to the diners and back to the staff, until someone turned a television on in the kitchen, and someone else dropped a glass, and a woman screamed as the glass shattered and a man yelled, “Oh my God, he’s been shot! The President’s been shot.”

At those words everyone in the restaurant jumped—*everyone but Spector,* who calmly swallowed the duck he’d been chewing, picked up his glass of wine and made a silent toast to the future of the agency.

The dinner was, understandably, cut short, and everyone made their way out to their cars to drive home through the falling snow. In his car, Spector assured his family that everything would be fine. Then he listened without comment as his wife and daughter exchanged uninformed opinions about *who would do such a terrible thing* and *what if we’re under attack* and *maybe it’s the Soviet Union…*

As he pulled into the street on which their hotel was located, Spector noticed a black car with tinted windows idling across from the hotel entrance. 

Passing, he waved, *and the car merged into traffic and drove obediently away.*",1,1762568969.0,horrorstories,1,1.0,False

I’m doing a little (a lot?) better these days, except for a current 2ish week-long dark patch fuelled by depression and a running injury throwing me off the comforting routines and leading to dopamine seeking and escapism through bp. 

With the holiday season coming up, I’ve been thinking how horrendous it all felt last year - the amplified food noise and guilt, the deep desire to partake in the festivities and feel normal again, feeling intense guilt when I slip up and bp and have to miss social events, which turns into a horrid spiral… worst of all - not having anyone to confide in. 

I’m hoping to do better this year and let myself be happy for once and enjoy the summer. If anyone feels like connecting, please dm me. I was thinking maybe little meetups for nice coffee walks, or even just a local virtual mini community where we can vent and support each other.

1ordo4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductAmazon/comments/1ordo4j/which_backpacking_stove_works_best_for_quick_meals/,Which backpacking stove works best for quick meals?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been backpacking for about three years now, and one question I always get asked is about which backpacking stove actually works best when you just want to eat and get back on the trail.

Let me save you some time and money by sharing what I've learned.

**What Actually Matters in a Backpacking Stove**

Look, when you're hungry after hiking 10 miles, you don't want to mess around for 20 minutes trying to boil water. You want something that lights fast, boils quick, and doesn't weigh a ton in your pack.

The best backpacking stoves for quick meals are canister stoves. Period. They're literally ready to go in seconds, and most can boil water in under 4 minutes. Compare that to alcohol stoves or wood-burning ones that take forever.

**My Experience with Different Types**

I started with an alcohol stove because it was cheap. Big mistake for quick meals. It took forever to boil water, and I couldn't control the flame well. Then I tried a wood-burning stove, which was cool for the environment but terrible when I was starving and just wanted instant noodles.

Canister stoves changed everything. You screw on the fuel canister, turn a knob, click the igniter, and boom – you're cooking. Perfect for dehydrated meals, coffee, or anything that needs hot water fast.

**What to Look For**

Weight is huge. If your camping stove weighs more than 4 ounces, it's probably too heavy unless you're car camping. Fuel efficiency matters too because you don't want to carry extra canisters.

Stability is another thing people forget about. Your lightweight stove means nothing if it tips over and spills your dinner.

I put together a list of the best options I've tested and researched. You can check them out here: https://athomewave.com/backpacking-stove

**Quick Tips for Faster Cooking**

Use a windscreen. Seriously, wind kills your boil time and wastes fuel. Even a DIY aluminum foil windscreen helps.

Pre-measure your water. Don't overfill your pot because extra water takes extra time and fuel.

Keep your fuel canister warm. Cold canisters perform worse, so I sleep with mine in my sleeping bag on cold nights (sounds weird but it works).

**My Top Recommendation**

After trying different portable stoves and ultralight options, I honestly think canister stoves with piezo ignition are the sweet spot for quick meals. They're reliable, fast, and easy to use even when you're tired.

If you want to see specific models with reviews and current prices, I'd recommend checking out this page: https://athomewave.com/backpacking-stove

They've got solid options for different budgets and needs.

**Bottom Line**

Don't overthink it. If you want quick meals on the trail, get a canister stove. They're not the absolute lightest or cheapest option, but they're the fastest and most convenient. Your hungry self will thank you after a long day of hiking.

This is still less than the BEAN\_LESS FACTOR of 15.  Adjusting for finer grind results in a BEAN\_LESS of 17 and no BEAN\_LESS ALARM.  However, power cycle and repeat test results in a BEAN\_LESS of 7 and an alarm with no change in grinder adjustments.  

The attached chart is from the service manual and explains how the detection system works.  Can anyone correlate the BEAN\_LESS values and the BEAN\_LESS FACTOR with t1, t2, t3 and t4?

Is there a reset or calibrate hidden somewhere in the service menu?  I have seen that on other models and expect there is some process to start the Xelsis on learning a new grinder.

I have only seen one service menu on the machine, but I expect there are others.

I noticed a coin cell battery soldered onto the main control board.  I expect that battery is no longer providing backup power for settings.  Could that be a factor?  The machine seems to be retaining time and date OK.

My best friend of five years(24F) and I(23F) planned for me to visit her during her semester abroad. We were so excited and spent months planning things to do. I booked a three-week stay, long enough to explore without rushing and to give her time to study and relax. She told me to leave everything to her and just focus on my solo plans.

A month before my trip, she told me her guy friend would be visiting for a week during my stay, and that we’d need to rearrange things so she could be with him. I was upset since I’d already booked hotels and appointments (tattoo, hair, and some special events). She promised to make it up to me with a weekend trip to the neighbouring country and said the guy would help with luggage, take pictures, and pay for dinner. She said my being mad was unreasonable as he was “travelling so far just to see her.” (What was I? A sack of onions?). I gave in and hoped it would still be a good trip.

When I arrived, she said we’d explore the local area, a port city, and then cross the border for the weekend. In reality, it was three exhausting days of constant travel with barely a day in each place. She was actively tiring herself out with her own rushed plans and thus refused to go out or do anything. She started to constantly belittle me, snap at me over the smallest things or whine over everything. A couple of things she said really hurt me deeply but I didn't want to ruin the trip so I tried to look past it.

At the end of the week, she left to meet the guy. We agreed to meet up later in the capital to try and salvage the trip. The first time, I waited two hours before she showed up, alone. We went to a few stores and had a late lunch where she told me she was planning to go steady with him before heading back. The second time, we met for a beauty treatment. I asked if she wanted to do anything after, but she said she had to get back to their hotel. Later, she texted that they’d changed their minds and wanted to go sightseeing. I took three trains to meet them, after she sent wrong directions three times, and then made it there only to find out they got bored and had already left. When I asked ""What gives?"" she just said “Oopsie” and stopped responding. I finally told her that I don't appreciate her behaviour, that I'll take it as her sign to indicate that our trip was over and to enjoy her time with her new man.

This was someone who used to visit me at work with coffee, plan trips with me, have wine nights, and be my biggest supporter. I was visiting her in my dream country (that I encouraged her to go to in the first place) and it was supposed to be amazing, but one week in, I regretted ever making plans for it. The country was beautiful, and I did my best to enjoy it, but I felt hurt, alone, and deeply disappointed.

Months later, she invited me to her “welcome home” party with friends, to talk about her “wonderful time abroad.” I’d waited for her to acknowledge what had happened, but she never did. So I sent a long message explaining how hurt and disappointed I was, how unfairly she’d treated me, and how angry I was that she ignored my feelings on the matter. I ended it by saying ""I’d rather check myself into a psych ward than come to your sh*tshow!""

She never responded to that. When mutual friends asked if she’d ever want to fix things, she said she’d love to, but was “so terribly busy"" and just last year she unfollowed me on social media. Am I the Jerk?",2,1762568554.0,AmITheJerk,2,1.0,False

Rent, food, bills, just existing here costs so much.

I finally started tracking what I spend because I was tired of running out of money halfway through the month. It’s not like I’m splurging - it’s just that every little thing adds up. Groceries, bus fare, a random lab fee, coffee when I have a long day.

I’ve been trying to get better with money, but it feels like trial and error. I use a debit card that reports to credit bureaus since I don’t want to mess with credit cards yet, and I’m trying to build some kind of credit history early. It’s working slowly, but I still feel like I’m learning backwards.

I wish there was a class here on real-world money stuff - how to budget, manage credit, or even file taxes. We talk about economics in theory, but I had to learn on Reddit what a utilization rate even is.

In 2013 a group of archeologists working in the mojave desert uncovered a strange chamber buried beneath the sand. They worked tirelessly around the clock for th next 2 weeks in order to dig it out. Finally, once the entrance had been uncovered, the archologists managed to use a crowbar to unseal the ancient stone door. Once inside they were astonished to discover a series of intricately carved and painted beautiful murals. Carbon dating placed them at over 20,000 years old. The archiologists took many photos of the murals and prepared to come back with an even larger team to keep exploring the mysterious room and look into th esurounding area to see if they could unearth any other relics. Not one of those archologists returned to that dig site. In fact, after that night no one ever saw them again, and all evidence of the digsite and any photographs taken was seemingly scrubbed from th eface of the panet. 

Only 1 single photo of those murals survived, and MK managed to dig it up from a secret shadow government site on the evil internet (its like the internet, but evil). The photo is grainy and blurry because for some reason the archiologists decided to use ass old cameras from lik ethe 80s instead of idk a fucking iphone i mean come on guys it was 2013 for crying out loud. 

Anyway, like i said only 1 photo remained, and you literally cant see anything in it BUT after putting it into photoshop myself and digitally manipulating the photo by writing TANIS on it in red marker you can clearly see one word written in red on the wall…. One word that will sound very familiar… one word that is…… TANIS

TANIS BOOM

Welcome back to Tanis, Im Nic Silver. We’re telling the story of tanis, in order, every 2 weeks, so if your new to tanis you should turn off your phone, take out your earbuds, and forget that you ever heard of this show. Trust me, it will ruin your life. If your not new to tanis, once again im sorry. I genuinely didnt know that I was accidentally performing an ancient mematic occult ritual within my podcast that would affect every single listener causing them to all have their orgaNS inverted and their minds taken over by eld fen. BUT since you all are here to stay forever i guess ill keep making more show.

When we left you last time MK, kARL AND myself had just managed to lose our mysterious persuers and make it to the relative safety of a crowded seattle coffee shop.

MK: Ok so who the hell were those guys Nic?

NIC: I have no idea. I didnt recognize any of them

Karl: I think I might have

NIC: Karl?

Karl: Im not sure if i should talk about it….

MK: oh for crying out loud karl you need to tell us whats going on those guys were trying to kill us

Karl: it was a long time ago

Nic: karl fuck you your not allowed to by mysterious and cryptic only I am

Karl: oh right sorry nic i forgot that was your thing

Nic: thank you

Karl: ok so basically back when i was in th army right around when i was in pakistan. One night I when i was on watch up in a high lookout tower i saw a bright light appear in the sky, it moved strangely and erratically. Even using my binoculars and scopes i couldnt make out what it was. I was right about to call it in when it zipped over to me and hovered right above my tower. It was a UFO.

NIc: what the hell? You cant be serious Karl a ufo?

MK: yea i mean evil movies that murder you are one thing but i mean phht come on aliens?

Karl: im serious guys they even abducted me and i cant remember much because they erased my memory and shit but im pretty sure that the guys chasing us back there were the same people who i remember seeing on the ship with the aliens

Nic: Well i think i know how we can find out for sure

It sounded crazy , but what if karl was telling th etruth? What if he really had been abducted by aliens and then had his memory erased? And how might these mysterious incidents relate to Tanis? I had a feeling a knew what i needed to do but I wasnt looking forward to it. Thighs hadnet ended quite so well the last time id spoken to this person.

Mk: Nic your fucking with us right? Why did you bring us here

We were standing in front of my former sleep therapist/ hypnosis doctor’s office. Dr. bernier had drugged me and sold my personal medical documents to tesla nova but she was literally the only hypnotherapist in seattle so we didnt have any other choice.

We entered dr bernier’s office. She had 13 new receptionists. They were all playing candy crush on 5th generation ipod touches for some reason. It was a strange sight.

Nic: Um hello is doctor bernier avaqilable we need to speak with her

Receptionist 32: ummmm like sorry no she like left to go on a 2 month long 	VACAY to bali and also she like gve us this

She handed me a laminated flyer with a photo of my face on it and the words: BANNED FROM HYPNOTHERAPY PERMANANTLY written under it.

Nic: oh

Receptinist 65: uh yea so your gonna like have to get outta here before we call the ban police the secret police force created in 2008 to specifically enforce bans on business premises. 

MK: thats a real thing nic we should get outta here

Nic: but we have to hypnotize karl so we can find out what happened when he was abducted

MK: its fine i have a plan

2 hours later the three of us were standing in the airport in seattle. MK had booked us a flight.

Karl: you know i really didnt actually agree to get hypnotized and also why th efuck are we flying to bali to track down dr bernier i know shes the only hypnotherapist in seattle but the whole world too?

MK: yes karl remember in season 12 when we learnmed that section didnt want to try to bribe every single hypnotheripist in the world to get info on breach participants so they enacted a hypnotherapist purge that killed them all off except for dr. bernier?

Karl: uh i was probably drunk during that part 

Nic: yea i dont remember that at all either are you sure that happened MK?

MK: uh yea it definitely did. Come to think of it now actually I think you were high of fentynal and like acid or something at the time Nic so i dont blame you for not remembering.

Nic: oh ok that sounds plausible

MK: anyway i hacked into the single wifi router that all of bali collectively uses so i was able to pinpoint dr bernier’s exact position so now all we have to do is fly over there and force her to give karl hypnotherapy.

Nic: oh yes what a great plan

Karl: uh guys i dont know if i really wanna be hypnotized again i have some trauma associated with that and remember Nic i told you that shit can fuck you up

Nic: karl stop being such a pussy how else are we gonna find the truth about what happened to you after you were abducted by those aliens and how its connected to tanis?

Mk: yea karl stop complaining your finally relevent to the plot arent you happy?

Karl: PEER PRESSURE EMERGENCY Uh-Uh no no bibbity bop kazow i cant be pressured no way no how!

Nic: what if i buy you airport cinnabon and beer

Karl: ok im in

After eating overpriced cinnamon bites and shitty craft beer we made our way to the terminal and boarded our flight. I got stuck next to a crying baby that wouldnt shut up once on our entire 23 hour long flight. Mk was in first class. Im not sure how she managed that but im assuming she did some hacker nonsense to get that seat. My suspicions were seemingly confirmed when i overheard the flight attendatnts informing a very irate buisnessman that he had cancled his ticket that afternoon and that his seat was taken and he would not be allowed to board.

I listened to all 89 seasons of tanis on the way because i love hearing the sound of my own voice. Once when i had to go to the bathroom i thought that one of the other passengers was the man that veronika referred to as the Father but when i looked again it turned out to just be a rasputin body pillow that someone had purchased a seat ticket for and had propped up

Eveentually we finally arrived in bali. Where bali is i couldnt tell ya but sure as sure we were there. I left the airpot in a daze. MK seemed to be fine as she had seemingly had a spa day up there in first class and karl just got drunk and slept through the whole flight. We made our way to th ehotel and i passed out for exactly 6 and a half minutes before MK told me that our return flight was scheduled for tomorrow so we really didnt have any time to waste.

I contemplated jumping out of the hotel window but decided that would be too much of a boring way for Nicodemus Silver world famous radio podcast host to die so i sucked it up and pulled myslef out of bed.

Mk led us through a maze of alleyways and streets occasionally checking her phone to check ourr bearing. Eventually we found ourselves in front of mysterious non descript grey brick building woith no name, company logo, or any identifying features at all. 

Nic: your sure this is yhje right place MK?

MK: im offende d that you would ebenm ask that nic

Karl: so should we go inside?

MK: um obviously why do you think we came all this way?

We all huddled close and opened the front door of the building and stepped inside……

Before I tell you what we found in that warehouse im going to read you something that we found that is seemingly connected to TANIS. Its something i ddint realize was relevant until much later. Here it is.

It was at this point that i got bored with writing this specific document so i actually found a different one to read, but this time i got my friend and producing partner Alex Reagan to read it and i know how much you all love HER YOU WONT SHUT UP ABOUT BLACK TAPES SEASON 3 PART 2 OR BLACK TAOES SEASON 4 like SHUT UP ALEX HAD TO GO FIGHT THE CENOPHUS WITH DOCTOR STRAND THEY ARE RAIDIO SILENT TO STAY UNDERCOVER but also she still reads shit 4 me so here it is

Alex reagan: from the notes of professor john corroman circa 1456 ad.

Today i saw a bird. It was a very pretty bird. It was a yellow bird. What a great bird.

Day 2: today i saw anothe bird! Its crazy i know. 2 birds in 2 days what are the odss! This time it was a blue bird. Very pretty bird.

Day 3: today i saw a red bird! Magnificent. What an amazing location for bird watching this place is

Day 4: today i saw a black bird. It went GAWAW GAWAW it was verey cute.

Day 5: today i saw a eldritch demon fromk the underside of reality. It ripped away my sanity ans soul from my body and left me as a husk of my former self

Day 6: today i saw a white bird! Truly mafgnificent!

Day 7: I saw another red bird tos=day uwu it wasvery cute\\

Day 8: today i fell down a hole in the ground and ended up in some kinda parallel dimension like a nightmare world identical to our own but slightly off somehow. Luckality i remembered that all i needed to do was find an elevator on a buildinmb that had at leat 10 floors and then play the elevaTOR game in reverse to escape, which i did just that and now im back

Day9: today i saw a beautiful yellowish grey bird! Very good bird.

Day 10: OH GOD OH GOD MY FLESH SINEW AND VERY BEING ARE BEING RIPPED AND SHREDDED FROM THIS WORLD OH AHH THE AGONY OG GOD SOMEONE PLEASE KILL ME OH GOD OF GOD OH GOD 

Day 11: today i saw a purple bird :3 I didnt even know they came in that color!

Day 12: NIC SILVER I AM TALKING TO YOU DIRECTLY FROM THE PAST. YOU ARE THE NAVIGATOR AND YOU NEED TO GO BACK INTO TANIS OR ALL OF HUMAITY IS FUCKED

So you can see why i had a feeling that this stuff was relevant somehow. It felt to pertinent, too exact to be coincidental. But it had to be a coincidence, didnt it? I mean I wasnt even alive in 1545 so how could john corroman know to leave me a message? Mk did some digging.

Mk: ok so it turners out there were actually like 13 different guys all names nic silver back in 1342 so really he could have bneen referring to any of them.

Nic: wait there are a bunch of people with myh name i thought it was a very unique name

Mk: yea so apppenently there was a secret order of watchers dedicated to keeping tanis safe and wnen you join you must take of the name of NIC SILVER TANIS GUARDIAN

Nic: thats crazy 

MK: you havent even heard the good part

Nic: and whats that

MK: i ran a dna test on you, and turners out your actually a direct decendent of th eanchient nicodemus silver tanis cult.\\

Nic: holy shit how did i never know about this

MK: maybe you did know and you just didnt realize it

N8ic: oh i guess that explains why both my parents were also named nic silver and were always actively feeding me drugs and letting me get kidnapped by priests in training so that i could awaken my tanis communication powers.

MK: yea in hindsight we really should have known something was up with you

So now we knew that my family had been connected to TANIS. What else about my past was being hidden from me? How closely tied was I was TANIS that I still didnt know?

I decided that in order to find out i would have to confront my mother, which would be tricky considering she had been dead for 15 years. Luckaly i knew someone who could help. Someone id only met relatively recently.

Phone ringing sound

Female voice: Hello Nina Sharp speaking how did you get this number

Nic: Its me I need a favor

TANIS BOOM

Before I tell you what i learned from Nina sharp, lets get back to what happened when me, MK and Karl entered that building in Bali.

We stepped inside that building not knowing what to expect, but a complestly empty abandoned warehouse was certintly not it. 

Nic: Its empty, it must be the wrong place

MK: no my tracker says shes here, look back there

Karl ans I both looked to the back of the warehouse where MK was pointing. She was right, at the far end of the warehouse i could see a door with a faint light coming from underneath.

Silently we all moved towards the back of the building. Karl did some cool flips and rolls like he was in a spy movie. MK just rolled her eyes.

When we were close enough I peaked through the window on th edoor to see what i could see

Inside the room i saw dr bernier standing in front of a person who was strapped down to a table with restraints. It was a person I recognized. It was Veronika Pillman.

Nic: She has veronika we have to save her

Karl: way ahead of you buddy 

Karl busted down the dior and the three of us stormed in

Dr:Bernier: holy shit what the fuck why are you here Nic?!?!?! What the hell? 

Nic: What are you doing with Veron9ika

Bernier: Uh im doing secret new hypnotherapy techniques on her wtf why are you here seriously

Nic: well im here to save veronika from you ive been having psychic dreams where she tells me to save her and now i finally found her\\

Karl: yea also i need you to hypnotize me so i can do regression therapy and rememver whgat hwppwned to me when i was abducted by aliens

Bernier: oh shit aliens??!?! Well why didngt you just say so

At this point doctor bernier unstrapped veronikas unconscious body and shoved her off th etable where she collapsed in a crumple dpile on the floor.

Bernier: ok dude get up here imma bout to hypnotize you so fucking good but theres one thing i need……

Karl: wjagt is it

Bernier: Im gonna need Nic here to act as a psychic resonance terminal to connect to your brainwaves and relay the info cuz of bullshit tanis reasons or saomething also nic is the main character so hes legally required to be important all the time

Karlk: ok sounds reasonable

Nic: yea sounds reasonable

Mk: is no one concerned about unconscious veronika on the floor?

Bernier and Nic and Karl all simultaniously: Shut up Mk we are about to do psychic hypnosis therapy 

Mk: jesus christ that was terrifying i guess ill just sit this one out

At this point dr bernier strapped karl and i down and placed a strange helment on out head s with a long tube connecting tyhem,\\\\

Bernier: this is yjhe only way for us to find out the truth about the aliens that abducted you karl. Nic wiull be phycically connected to you in order to experience your memories from the first person and be able to relay them back to us

Karl: ok hit it

Bernier hits karl with an enourams comically large inflatable hammerknocking him out instantly

As soon as karl passed out a flood of images stared appearing in my mind.

I was there, inside karls memory. I was laying strapped to a table inside of a stange room. It was large and round and filled with stange organic looking machinery. I saw creatures unlike anything id ever seen before wandering around the room but when i focused i could see someone else…. Someone in the back of the room…… someone id only ever seen on television screens…….. someone whos name might sound very familiar to some of those listening depending on how well you know celebrities…………. It was …………..none other than………….the one and only…………………………………WILL SMITH

TANIS BOOM

Yes thats right famous actor william smitheron jr the third the 2nd th eseniour juioniur the 3rd 4th quatraine limit breaker king of france himself bill gates john smith francis william smithsoniam the 18th von carlstein omega res novae enternatus carolina reaper hell gate brian himself was there in that very UFO.

TANIS BOOM 

But it wasnt just any will smith….. It was men in black will smith…… but….. This didnt make any sense! William sitherson was always opposed to the aliens in this classic films….. How could he be now working WITH the aliens?????? Something didnt feel right…….

Suddenly I felt the BLUR start up and suddenly i was floating above Karl. Somehow the blur was allowing me to astral project back in time within karls hypnosis memory regression and see things that even he wasnt aware of. This was all the evidence I needed that this event was somehow connected to the mysterious and ancient legendary myth of TANIS.

I floated over to willllllllllllerm the smith and looked hi in the eyes, to my astonishment he turned to face me and looked me back in the eyes. \\\\\\

Will smith: Nic Silver…. I knew you would come here. I needed to speak with you so I manipulated these aliens into retroactivy kidnapping your best friend karl van sant before he even knew you so that now in 2077 when this season of tanis takes place, you would be able to come back here to speak with me through karls active living memtic memory of this event. You see i am me but at the same time i am not me. The me you see before you is the me that i desperately wished to speak with you at that time and was reflected into the consciousness of Karl through the morphogenetic field. He carried that version of me that i had carefully curated for this moment for his whole life, tucked within the fields of his subconscious until at this very moment that i in the future present past had foreseen and already experienced knew that the 14th casual race of anti-life humanity seed-purge carrier entity transport vessals would be sent to exterminate you three on this day in order to prevent you from coming into contact with the Elder SaipioGenesis Construct and ascending you to your final awakening withing the 4d plane that we have scaled our manipulation efforts to. They could not allow the seed beerer dna within you to awaken and begin the unraveling of the heavens. Within that rite would see the undoing of all pre established godheads and all previous “Alpha” and “omeaga” entities. Thus these Harbingers or emmesairues of The ones who feed could not allow you, the navigator ie godhead annihilation entity to reach its final mutation state within the ritual of TANIS. This is the reason for your very existence. I sent my seeded partial consciousness here to this place within karl from th epast to warn you about this very imp-

Before will could ramble anymore like some kind of schizophrenic nutcase a giant explosion rocked the entire ship. A hole was blown in the side and i could suddenly see out into the void of the endless cosmos. I could also see the thing that had created that explosion. It was an enourmas mecanical huminoid creature. It had attached itself to the side of the ship and blown it open, the mech reached its hand out to me

Mech: Nic Silver, come with me if you want to live

At this point will smitherson the 3rd pulled out an automatic rifle and aimed it at me

Will: dont you dare go with them nicodemus this is too important to let you fuck up

Mech: NIC! Get over here NOW this is the only way to learn the truth about TAnis, your parents and what really happened to Alex Reagan

What really happened to alex. That was enticing info. Last time I had heard from alex was wehen she mad mailed me a post card from the UK 3 years ago. I hadabt heard from here since and had no idea what she and dr strand had even been up too. 

Mech: NIC the black tapes, tanis, the last movie, rabbits, faerie….. Thety are all connected. You have to trust me, come with me i can answer all your questions

That was a big promise. How could I turn something like that down? Well if youve learned anything about me by now you know, I couldnt. 

Without thinking i ran towards the mechs open hand as will smithonian oart 2 electric boogaloo opened fitre on me

Luckality he was just absolutely the worst at shooting cuz he missed all his shots and i lept into the mechas hand which closed around me shielding me from harm as i fekt it leap off the ship and begin flying away

I got really bored of waiting to land so i took a lil nappy nap and then nwe were there.

I disembarked and looked around at my surroundings. What i saw shocked and confused me. 

I was inside the highest penthpouse suit of tilted towers famous landing spot from hit game fortnite. In front of me was someone i never thought i would meet in real life

It was memphis tennessee the hedgehog from hit sega video game franchise sonic T. Hedgehog game sonic aught 6. 

Memphis tennessee: Nicodemus silver! Welcome to my gamer pad. We are going to get so tilted at the towers

Nic: i dont understand whats happening here

Menphilioma: its ok no one does. This is all still technically happening in karl van sants subconscious, or should i say GEOFF van sant…. Thats right geoff and karl switch names not once……… but TWICE!! Thereby nullifying their switch to beijing with! A double blind duel agent ultra switcheroo that no one would ever see coming.

Nic: I take offense tio that 

Menthis: well ill fight you for the role of main charachter in tanis then

Nic: ok your on no one can out special tanis boy tmtmtmtm me nicodemus silver

Before memphis the hedgepig could do anything i lunged at him wit the rabied ferocity of a sleep deprived podcast host and conduit to ancient entities beyond mortal comprehension. I shoved my thumbs directly into his one big weird sonic the hedgehog conjolined eyeball. He started screaming in agony when suddenly i was thrown off of him by derrick. 

Derrick: hey hwat the fuck man 

Nic: he tried to threaten my main character status this cannot be tolerated i am super special tanis boy tmtmtmtm and NO ONE ELSE IS ALLOWED

Derrick: well muchaca the hedgehog is my best friend in the entire world so i wonmt let you pop his uni eye thats where he gets all his future sight prophecy power

Nic: just tryu and stop me

I lunged forward towards derrick in a blinding flash of speed. Before i could make impact however, derrick sidesteped me and swunfg down towards me with his demon soul blade. 

I instant transmissioned out of the way and telepoted behind him, summoning my own weapon, a blade made of pure TANIS energy. I stabbed forwards intop derricks back but at the last second i felt my blade be deflected and i saw a blinding flash of red

I flew back, but managed to flip myself upright and land, skidding back along the floor. Someone new now stood between me and derrick

Welcome back to season 3 of the the Black tapes podcast, im alex reagen. This season we continue our exploration into the mysterious and enigmatic founder of the strand institute doctor richard strand and his collection of stange cases refereed to as the black tapes.

I know I left you on quite a cliff hanger at the end of our mid season break, I had just revealed that along with strands tickets for us to go to geneva, which we had determined to be the true axis mundi and the location which the ordrer of the cenophus and thomas warren of Daeva corporation had been leading us to all along. Not only that but it turns out that howard strand, richard strands father might be alive. Or my alternative tickets to an undisclosed location where i had proposed strand and i just simply run away and leave everything behind so as to not further endanger ourselves and others in this story that had become far more than either us us had anticipated?

Well Im happy to tell you that because your hearing this episode, we didnt decide to run. I had you a promise, that as long as you all would keep listening that I would keep digging deeper until I discovered the full truth at the heart of the black tapes, the conophus, the mysterium, and the unsound. 

Strand and i knew the chances of howard and cora lee both being held captive by thomas warren in geneva were slim and that it was most lickly just a ploy to get us out there, but the cenophus was wasting their time. Strand and I were already in too deep. We were going and nothing was going to stop us.

\*airport noises\*

Strands fucking sexy ass sultry voice\~\~: Alex, are you sure about this? Its going to be dangerous and we can still-

Alex: richard really? After everything we’ve been through these past three years, after everything weve uncovered about your family and your past, th efact that cora lee is still alive and maybe even your father and yet still you think we have the luxury of backing out?

Strand: We always have a choice alex

Alex: and my choice was made the minute i realized that there was more going on with these black tapes than we originally thought. Im seeing this through, to the end.

At this point strands eyes softened. He appeared to relax slightly as he heard my resolve.

Strand: Im glad you feel the same way as i do alex, i just had to make sure. I dont want to put you in a dangerous situation just because you feel obligated to help me

Alex: Richard I care about you, and i care about finding the truth. Dangerous situation or not we can and will make it through this. Im not going to let you go face thomas warren, the man who destroyed your family and has been stalking you all these years, without backup.

Strand: alex I dont know what to say. I know weve had our disagreements and fights but im glad that I met you, and im glad that your the one standing here by my side.

Alex: im glad i met you too richard. Now its almost time to board our flight. Lets go put an end to this.

We made our way through the crowded seattle airpot towards our terminal. As I walked through the crowds of people I couldnt help but think about everything taht had happened over these past three years. What had started as a seemingly simple podcast episode about the paranormal hobby of ghost hunting had spiraled into a web of complex conspiracy filled with a vast world wide spanning cult, real death, and seemingly real demons. 

Everything strand and I had been working towards had finally led us here, headed to Geneva, the eye of the storm. The place thomas warren had apparently been secretly using as a lab to bring some kind of shadow entity into our reality in order to bring to fruition his ancient order’s goal of ushering in a new age of destruction and rebirth with a race of shadow’s stepping forth from shadow as this worlds new masters. 

It sounded insane, but even if their supernatural beliefs were not actually true, we had found real eviedenve of a very desiccated and orginized network of people doing very harmful subliminal and hypnosis techniques to very young children and criminally insane mental instritution paitents. 

The order of the cenophus itself was real and it needed to be bright to light and stopped, and if there was something strand and i could do to help then we would do everything we could.

Strand of course had his own personal reasons, and i too had become invested in strands past and the truth about what his father had been preparing him for. There were stil lso many unanswered questions about howard strand and his relationship to thomas warren as well as cora lee and her anchient order of watchers. 

As we strode through the airport, all these thoughts racing through my head i fekt a sense of finality, like this trip would be the one that would finally reval everything , put every puzzle piece in place, put three years of searxching into perspective and make everything click.

If only I had known then what i know now.

I GASPED WHEEZING FOR BREATH AS I SAT Bolt upright on the table. In front of me lay karl, and between us stood berinier.

Nic: og jesus christ thank god im back i think i accidentally travened to a universe where the black tapes actually continued whew i sure im glad we avoided that 

Beriner: Nic did you learn the truth of the aliens?

Nic: uh no tbh i think i just was extremely high and had a crazy ass trip

Bernier: well that makes sense as me and walter bishop here pumped you both so full of lsd and dmt that you should have astral projected back into anchiwnt myan times before the 13 cosmic realms had merged into one

Nic: wait walter bishop is here i fucking love that guy!

\*walter bishop steps out from the shadows of the corner of the room\*

Walter: yes helelo nicodemus its been quite some time

Nic: wait your not……..

Walter: hehehehhe yes…..

Nic: no

Walter: yes

Nic: no no it cant be

Walter: yes 

Nic: y-your….. WALTERNATE

Cleaning tips were contradictory— some said no soap while others said soap was ok. Yes to vinegar… no to vinegar. Baking soda is good and baking soda is bad. Sigh…

I scrubbed with hot water and elbow grease — the coffee basket had a disgusting “puck” of something that once dreamed it was coffee. And then decided to risk white vinegar to descale. The interior is discolored but smooth.

I have not been able to find a digitized instruction manual… so I am hoping someone can help out.

— Is it possible to remove the gasket filter to continue the deep clean??

— A college buddy recommended trying a Bialetti gasket as a replacement…. If so, any idea what size?

— Is the discoloration inside “safe” for making coffee? Or does that indicate the metal is messed up from the years and I shouldn’t use it??

— Anything else I should know?

Red Cup Day happens around the same time every year. This is consistently one of Starbucks’ busiest days. Because of this, Red Cup Day is targeted as a potential date for workers to strike over unfair working conditions, union busting, and any other relevant unethical actions that Starbucks has taken.

This year, Red Cup Day is on November 13th. [Starbucks Workers United has announced their plans to strike,](https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2025/11/07/starbucks-baristas-have-voted-to-strike-next-thursday-on-red-cup-day/) claiming that contract negotiations with Starbucks have stalled after the new CEO took over (Starbucks denies these allegations).

This is a brief overview of some of Starbucks’ biggest controversies of 2025, and a general timeline:

May 2025: [Workers strike over new dress code changes, calling them “regressive and unnecessary.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/business/starbucks-strike-baristas-walk-outs.html)

September 16, 2025: [Starbucks is in the headlines as people order “the Ch\*rlie K\*rk drink.”](https://people.com/starbucks-responds-viral-charlie-kirk-drink-order-controversy-video-11813345) [Starbucks confirms that “there are no restrictions on customers using Cha\*rlie K\*rk’s name on their order.”](https://about.starbucks.com/press/2025/customer-names-and-messages-on-orders/)

September 25, 2025: S[tarbucks closes hundreds of stores that are “underperforming”](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/26/business/starbucks-stores-closing-brian-niccol) as part of a “restructuring plan.” Additionally, there is some coverage about layoffs as baristas have been speaking about being given little to no notice about the closures, denied transfers, and offered inadequate severance. There has also been reporting that implies that Starbucks is using the closures as a union busting tactic, allegedly targeting union stores.   
  
October 6, 2025: [Baristas rally at Starbucks HQ to protest store closures.](https://www.axios.com/local/seattle/2025/10/06/starbucks-workers-rally-seattle-hq-store-closures)

October 13, 2025: [Reporting on a LinkedIn poll in which 53% of respondents said they do not drink Starbucks coffee](https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2025/10/08/starbucks-closures-may-signal-a-shift-in-consumer-values/), many of them indicating the price as a significant barrier. Some also indicated that they did not support Starbucks due to their union busting.

October 16, 2025: [“Starbucks CEO reveals a ‘secret AI barista’ that assists with making coffee in real time—and may one day predict your order”](https://fortune.com/2025/10/16/starbucks-ceo-brian-niccol-secret-ai-barista-green-dot/)

>Niccol said he envisions a future where friction is entirely removed from the \[Starbucks\] experience, potentially integrating AI-driven systems so seamlessly that customers might not even need to open the app. He suggested that a user could simply talk into their phone, saying, “Hey I need my Starbucks order I’ll be there in 10 minutes,” and the drink would be ready upon arrival. This ability to be more “anticipating what we know you’re going to order,” along with the implementation of voice ordering, is where the brand plans to utilize AI to enhance personalization and speed.

November 4, 2025: “[Starbucks once seemed unstoppable in China. Its U.S. owner is now giving up control.”](https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/04/business/starbucks-china-divestment-intl-hnk) Starbucks announced it will sell a 60% stake in its China operations as part of a $4bn deal after (you guessed it) severely underperforming in China.

November 7, 2025: “[Is Britain falling out of love with Starbucks?”](https://www.thetimes.com/business-money/companies/article/starbucks-coffee-chain-closures-2fmr50ft8) Reports that about store closures in the UK, mirroring the same issues Starbucks is having in the US.

Is it a coincidence that Starbucks suddenly went viral over a super cute glass bear cup, right after a wave of negative headlines, knowing that a strike on Red Cup Day was likely?

Currently, when you google Starbucks, and then click the news tab, the first thing that comes up is dozens of articles about the bearista cup - not about the union busting, the strike, or any of the other negative press. I would assume this is also true of social media (I know for a fact that it is on Reddit).

It seems very likely to me that Starbucks launched a deliberate viral marketing campaign about this cup, including creating artificial scarcity so that it would become a controversy. The same thing more or less happened with those studded Halloween tumblers years ago.

Instead of people talking about Starbucks’ union busting, Brian’s continual blunders, the business failing financially on a global scale…now the conversations are about this adorable little sold-out cup. Everyone is talking about how Starbucks didn’t send enough cups, complaints about baristas getting first dibs, scalpers buying all the cups, and the outrageous cost of buying a resold cup. People are heartbroken that they didn’t get one, crying over this cup, berating baristas, throwing tantrums, calling stores, leaving reviews…all about a little bear cup.

Despite it going viral, Starbucks sent 1-2 of them to each store, knowing exactly how big the demand would be. Maybe it's conspiratorially minded of me, but I feel like this was an intentional attempt to change the subject of the conversation.",1,1762567653.0,starbucks,2,1.0,False

1ord9sn,https://i.redd.it/8sj2kwu8yxzf1.jpeg,Anyone else getting Viva Piñata vibes?,"Just ran the Breeding Daisies side quest (where the gross farmer breeds threshers). 

As I watched the hump house writhe before ejaculating hearts all I could think about is Viva Piñata! It was an XBox 360 game from rare where you bred cute piñata animals thru minigames. Every species has a unique mating dance you could watch in their homes that ended with bursts of hearts. 

Part of me thinks there’s is no way this was intentional… while the other part wants there to be a “hot coffee” mod where we could watch the elaborate dance that the programmers where afraid to let us all see. 

Anyone else over 30 have this thought?

1ord4qd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetaReaders/comments/1ord4qd/in_progress_1800_fantasy_this_is_the_first/,[in progress] [1800] [Fantasy] this is the first chapter of something I’m currently writing.,"Chapter one:

Fifteen years ago.

Nothing will ruin Mrs. Reema's mood this evening. Maybe one of her kids waking up dramatically, as usual, could do, but she refuses to think of that at the moment.


She opens the windows to let some of the chilly September breezes in, carrying along the scent of the neighbors' flowers, those which, just for the record, she had fought relentlessly time after time to have them removed, because her youngest child, Rami, was allergic. But now, she's just smiling, unlike her usual self, finding herself grateful for the fight she lost, and for the flowers she can finally smell.

In her right hand, she is holding a cup of coffee, while her left hand is clenched around a piece of chocolate that she had previously hidden from the children's reach. The silence that fills the room makes her realize that the children are fast asleep, so the tension leaks between her fingers, allowing her to open her hand and let the chocolate free. Something tiptoes into her soul, maybe happiness. Not just for the chocolate she can finally eat, but also for the idea of stillness that she rarely experiences these days.

What Mrs. Reema doesn't know yet is that this piece of chocolate is the last thing she will ever hide from anyone.

Mrs. Reema isn't a bad mother; on the contrary, she loves her children, all three of them. However, this peace of mind is rare in this house, as she assumes the roles of both mother and father, since her husband started working abroad to afford the luxurious level of life they're having.

Speaking of her husband, Mrs. Reema looks at the clock hanging above the TV, realizing that it's almost ten, which means that Mr. Fadi's weekly call is approaching.

She loves her husband a lot, though, thinking about it, she loves him way less than her children, but way more than a stranger man as well. She would've loved to tell her kids when they grow up, about the epic love story they went through, except, of course, there wasn't one. It was an arranged marriage, where a middle-aged woman assessed her physical and psychological traits, as Mrs. Reema would later tell herself, and decided that she would be a good wife for her son; and, truth be told, she was right.

She adjusts her posture to be close to the landline, placing her right leg on top of her left, and begins to swing her leg in an attempt to keep her patience in check.

With an eye on the phone and the other on the clock, she swirls her finger through the strand of hair falling on the side of her face.

As soon as the phone rings, she leaps in a swift motion towards it, not allowing it to destroy her victories by waking up the kids. This has become her favorite sport for the past five years.

For a good portion of time, before their phone call, she used to change her clothes, put on some blusher, and spray some perfume where Mr. Fadi used to kiss her. But later on, she realized that he couldn't see her and that lying was way easier.

""Hello ..."" his voice comes through the phone, and although she hears it every week, it sounds estranged.

""Hey Fadi,"" She answers with a failed attempt to make her voice warmer.

""How are you … and the kids?""""We're doing fine, what about you?""

""I missed you all, especially you, Reema.""

""We miss you too ..."" She shifts in her place restlessly, thinking about moments ago when she'd questioned her love for him, and now his voice is full of it.

""You told me that you'd cut your hair this week."" His voice carries a question, and something warm beneath it.

""Yeah, but I didn't find the time for it."" Silence stretches a moment too long. She was able to feel his disappointment through the static before breaking it, ""I have some news.""

""Is everybody okay?"" He asks worriedly.

""Don't worry, everyone's fine,"" she says calmly, ""we're gonna be six instead of five.""

Silence, again. This time, she is sure he didn't get the hint, so she decides to lay it clear.

""I'm pregnant,"" she says in an indifferent tone.

""Congratulations, Love,"" he says with a laugh, which made the sentence incoherent.

""Congratulations to us.""

From day one, Mr. Fadi said that he wanted to make a big family, ten kids, maybe twelve, who knows. And although she didn't mind back then, her desire to have children decreased after each pregnancy.

""We're having a daughter?"" he asks hopefully.

She rests a hand on her belly, ""I don't know. I'm only eight weeks in.""

To be fully honest, she also hopes for a daughter, as all of her children are boys. And the sooner she has a daughter, the sooner they decide to stop having more children. You see? She's not cold-hearted, but she has to think about her abilities as a mother first; she has to know where to draw the line.

For the next hour, their conversation branched out in many directions. In some cases, Mrs. Reema decided to elaborate, such as the color of the dress she was wearing, which she described while adjusting her pajamas. In others, she decided to keep it brief, as there's no need for him to know that Joe had fallen off the bed the night before, which resulted in a stitch in a place where his hair will grow soon. Or that the school called about Jack's low grades. She can fix all of that. What she can't fix is the psychiatrist appointment she took for Rami, her youngest, who has started to have strange, bloody dreams.

""I have to hang up now, the units are almost out."" Mr. Fadi announces, for which Mrs. Reema answers with a sigh that escaped her lips.

""Don't worry, darling, I'll be right beside you at the time of delivery.""

Mrs. Reema smiles for the first time during the call. She needed to hear that. ""I love you."" She whispers, although no one else is in the room.

""I love you too,"" and with that, he hangs up the phone.

She's glad that the call has ended by eleven, not that she was bored, but her favorite soap opera series is about to start. It had happened previously that the conversation made her miss the opening of episode number one hundred fifty-three, where one of the protagonists, whose name she had forgotten, announced his love under the rain.

She turns on the television after making sure that the living room's door is shut, so the sound won't reach her sleeping beauties inside. She sips her second cup of coffee, looking out the window, while waiting for the show to begin.

Amazement grips her as the scene unfolds before her. She doesn't know exactly when it happened. The cold breeze stops, and she starts to wipe away the beads of sweat that form on the edge of her nose repeatedly. The sky that was clear minutes ago is now full of shooting stars.

Mrs. Reema closes her eyes to make a wish; after all, one of the hundreds of shooting stars she's now seeing might make it come true. But before she can think about the wish, a sound from the television cuts the series's opening theme and is replaced by the news theme.

Her annoyance rapidly changes when she sees the face of the news anchor now on display. A handsome man in his forties, Nizar Yaghi. Her favorite TV personality. Actually, every woman's favorite TV personality.

He starts presenting in a smooth but professional tone:

""Ladies and gentlemen,

We are more than sorry to cut your favorite programs to broadcast the following announcement...""

He adjusts his tie while talking, leaving Mrs. Reema staring at his every movement. And after several moments, she realizes that she is licking her lips, and that she didn't hear a single word he said till now.

""The nature of the meteors remains unknown at the moment. While authorities have confirmed sightings of numerous meteors breaching the atmosphere, reports have surfaced of fiery objects crashing in various locations, including several countries in the Middle East, Canada, Brazil, and even a landfill site in India.

We urge citizens to remain indoors and follow safety orders. Do not touch any foreign objects until specialists arrive on the scene.

And in case you were wondering: No, you can't make a wish if a meteor lands next to you.

Someone in Canada already tried, and now he's wishing his eyebrows would grow back.""

He finishes the report with a satisfied smile about the joke he made at the end of it. And Mrs. Reema finds herself laughing out loud.

The clock is now pointing at midnight, or to be more specific, it's one minute to twelve.

In the next few seconds, everything will change. Not only here, not only in Mrs. Reema and her children's life alone, but life as we know it will change forever.

Mrs. Reema can feel the air vibrating around her. She looks out the window and sees the whole sky moving, except for one star.

The door behind her opens up, and she hears little steps behind her. She turns around to see that Rami is now awake and looking with tear-filled eyes for her in the room.

She turns back to the window and finds that the star is now larger. Rami bursts into tears as soon as he sees his mother, and she walks to hug him.

Although the lights are on, the room becomes brighter, which makes her look back at the sky searching for the source. Her eyes are now fixed at the window, from which she can see that the previously mentioned star is now the size of the moon. Or maybe bigger.

Every atom in her body begs her to look away, but she can't. She opens her eyes wider, realizing that what she's seeing is not a star, but a meteor falling towards her.

With a quick movement, thanks to the jumping-towards-the-phone sport, she picks Rami between her arms and runs towards the corridors, screaming the names of her three children to wake them up, forgetting that Rami is now screaming louder between her hands. She reaches their room, puts Rami on the ground, and reaches out to wake them.

It's exactly twelve now. A crashing sound rings through the air, and the whole building shakes, throwing Mrs. Reema to the ground.

The power went out across the entire neighborhood. And although it's expected to drown in darkness, the streets glow as they never before; lit by what had fallen moments ago in Mrs. Reema's yard, leaving behind a scent of burning that overpowers the fragrance of the neighbors' flowers.",1,1762567141.0,BetaReaders,1,1.0,False
1ord4gb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Moccamaster/comments/1ord4gb/6_months_in_and_feeling_discouraged_grinder/,6 months in and feeling discouraged— grinder problems?,"Hi everyone! 

I’ve had my moccamaster KBGV select for about 6 months now and have struggled to get a solid cup out of it. I’m using a 1zpresso J-MAX S grinder, which is more tuned for espresso (I’m coming from a failed espresso phase). I’ve tried grinding all over the map with it, but so far seem to be getting the most tolerable cups at around 2.3.0-2.6.0. Visually, it looks like I’m hitting the sweet spot based on what I see in this sub (coarse sand/sea salt). But there’s still something off about them. The initial taste is very acidic and then immediately flat. If I go finer I can get burnt/bitter, and coarser it becomes even more flat, but haven’t been able to find a sweet spot. I have been wondering if maybe my grinder is generating too many fines which is preventing even extraction no matter what I’m grinding at. 

Would it be worth it to upgrade to a more versatile grinder? Or should I keep working? Some other info about my process:

- Using a 1:16.7 brew ratio (30g of coffee, 500 ml of water)
- Brewing with the switch on half pot
- Descaled my machine about 2 weeks ago
- Using Counter Culture Hologram, but have tried various other beans to no avail. 
- The brew time is right around 3:40 
- I’m wetting the filter

1ord33z,https://www.reddit.com/r/normancrane/comments/1ord33z/spooks/,Spooks,"It was a busy intersection and the weather was bad, but Donald Miller was out there, knocking on car windows while holding a sign that said:

    single dad
    out of work
    2 kids
    please help

He was thirty-four years old.

He'd been homeless for almost two years.

He knocked on a driver's side window and the driver shook her head, not even making eye contact. The next lowered his window and told him to get a fucking job. Sometimes people asked where his kids were while he was out here. It was a fair question. Sometimes they spat at him. Sometimes they got really pissed because they had to work hard for their dime while he was out here begging for it. *A leech on society. A deadbeat. A liar. A fraud, a cheat, a swindler, a drain on the better elements of the world.* But usually they just ignored him. Once in a while they gave him some money, and that was what happened now as a woman distastefully held a ten-dollar bill out the window. “Thank you, ma'am,” said Miller, taking it. “Feed your children,” said the woman. Then the light changed from red to green and the woman drove off. Miller stepped off the street onto the paved shoulder, waited for the next red light, the next group of cars, and repeated.

“It's almost Fordian,” said Spector.

Nevis nodded, pouring coffee from a paper cup into his mouth. “Mhm.”

The pair of them were observing Miller through binoculars from behind the tinted windshield of their black spook car, parked an inconspicuous distance away. Spector continued: “It's like capitalism's chewed him up for so long he's applied capitalist praxis to panhandling. I mean, look: it’s a virtual assembly line, and there he dutifully goes, station to demeaning station, for an entire shift.”

“Yeah,” said Nevis.

The traffic lights changed a few times.

The radio played Janis Joplin.

“So,” said Nevis, holding an empty paper coffee cup, “you sure he's our guy?”

“I'm sure. No wife, no kids, no friends or relatives.”

“Ain't what his sign says.”

“Today.”

“Yeah, today.”

(Yesterday, Miller had been stranded in the city after getting mugged and needed money to get back to Pittsburgh, but that apparently didn't pull as hard on the heartstrings.)

“And you said he was in the army?”

“Sure was.”

“What stripe was he?”

“Didn't get past first, so I wouldn't count on his conditioning too much.”

“Didn't consider him suitable—or what?”

“Got tossed out before they could get the hooks into his head. Couldn't keep his opinions on point or to himself. Spoke his mind. *Independent thinker.*” Nevis grinned. “But there's more. Something I haven't told you. Here,” he said, tossing a fat file folder onto Spector’s lap.

Spector stuck a toothpick in his mouth and looked through the documents.

“Check his school records,” said Nevis.

Spector read them. “Good grades. No disciplinary problems. Straight through to high school graduation.”

“Check the district.”

Spector bit his toothpick so hard it cracked. He spat out the pieces. “This is almost too good. North Mayfield Public School Board, Cincinnati, Ohio—and, oh shit, class of 1952. That's where we test-ran *Idiom*, isn't it?”

“Uh huh,” said Nevis.

Spector picked up his binoculars and watched Miller beg for a few moments.

Nevis continued: “Simplants. False memories. LSD-laced fruit juice. Mass hypnosis. From what I've heard, it was a real fucking mental playground over there.”

“They shut it down in what, fifty-four?”

“Fifty-three. A lot of the guys who worked there went on to *Ultra* and *Monarch*. Some fell off the edge entirely, so you know what that means.”

“And a lot of the subjects ended up dead, or worse—didn't they?”

“Not our guy, though.”

“No.”

“Not yet anyway.” They both laughed, and they soon drove away.

It had started raining, and Donald Miller kept going up to car after car, holding his cardboard sign, now wet and starting to fall apart, collecting spare change from the spared kindness of strangers.

A few days later a black car pulled up to the same intersection. Donald Miller walked up to it and knocked on the driver's side window. Spector was behind the wheel. “Spare any money?” asked Donald Miller, showing his sign, which today said he had one child but that child had a form of cancer whose treatment Miller couldn't afford.

“No, but I can spare you a job,” said Spector.

“A job. *What?*” said Miller.

“Yes. I'm offering you work, Donald.”

“What kind of—hey, how-the-hell do you know my name, huh!”

“Relax, Donald. Get in.”

“No,” said Miller, backing slowly away, almost into another vehicle, whose driver **honked.** Donald jumped. “Don't you want to hear my offer?” asked Spector.

“I don't have the skills for no job, man. Do you think if I had the skills I'd be out here doing this shit?”

“You've already demonstrated the two basic requirements: standing and holding a sign. You're qualified. Now get in the car, please.”

“The *fuck* is this?”

Spector smiled. “Donald, Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office.”

“What, you're fucking crazy, man,” said Miller, his body tensing up, a change coming over his eyes and a self-disbelief over his face. “Who the fuck is—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald. Please get in the car.”

Miller opened his mouth, looked briefly toward the sky, then crossed to the other side of the car, opened the passenger side door, and sat politely beside Spector. When he was settled, Nevis—from the back seat—threw a thick hood over his head and stuck him with a syringe.

Donald Miller woke up naked next to a pile of drab dockworkers’ clothes and a bag of money. He was disoriented, afraid, and about to run when Spector grabbed his arm. “It's all right, Donald,” he said. “You don't need to be afraid. You're in Principal Lewis’ office now. He has a job for you to do. Just put on those clothes.”

“Put them on and do what?”

Miller was looking at the bag of money. He noted
other people here, including a man in a dark suit, and several people with cameras and film equipment. “Like I said before, all you have to do is hold a sign.”

“How come—how come I don't remember coming here? Huh? *Why am I fucking naked?* Hey, man… you fucking kidnapped me didn't you!”

“You're naked because your clothes were so dirty they posed a danger to your health. We took them off. Try to remember: I offered you a job this morning, Donald. You accepted and willingly got in the car with me. You don't remember the ride because you feel asleep. You were very tired. We didn't want to wake you until you were rested.”

Miller breathed heavily. “Job doing what?”

“Holding a sign.”

“OK, and what's the sign say?”

“It doesn't say anything, Donald—completely blank—just as Principal Lewis likes it.”

“And the clothes, do I get to keep the clothes after we're done. Because you took my old clothes, you…”

“You’ll get new clothes,” said Spector.

“And Principal Lewis wants me to put on these clothes and hold the completely blank sign, and then I’ll get paid and get new clothes?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

So, for the next two weeks, Donald Miller put on various kinds of working clothes, held blank signs, sometimes walked, sometimes stood still, sometimes opened his mouth and sometimes closed it, sometimes sat, or lay down on the ground; or on the floor, because he did all these things in different locations, inside and outside: on an empty factory floor, in a muddy field, on a stretch of traffic-less road. And all the while they took photographs of him and filmed him, and he never knew what any of it meant, why he was doing it. They only spoke to give him directions: “Look angry,” “Pretend you’re starving,” “Look like someone’s about to push you in the back,” “like you’re jostling for position,” “like you’ve had enough and you just can’t fucking take it anymore and whatever you want you’re gonna have to fight for it!”

Then it was over.

Spector shook his hand, they bought him a couple of outfits, paid him his money and sent him on his way. “Sorry, we have to do it this way, but—”

Donald Miller found himself at night in a motel room rented under a name he didn’t recognise, with a printed note saying he could stay as long as he liked. He stayed two days before buying a bus ticket back to Cincinnati, where he was from. He lived well there for a while. The money wasn’t insignificant, and he spent it with restraint, but even the new clothes and money couldn’t wipe the stain of homelessness off him, and he couldn’t convince anyone to give him a job. Less than a year later he was back on the streets begging.

The whole episode—because that’s how he thought about it—was clouded by creamy surreality, which just thickened as time went by until it seemed like it had been a dream, as distant as his time in high school.

One day, several years later, Donald Miller was standing outside an electronics shop, the kind with all the new televisions set up in the display window by the street and turned so that all who passed by could see them and watch and marvel and need to have a set of his own. Miller was watching daytime programming on one of the sets when the broadcast *on all the sets,* which had been showing a few different stations—*cut suddenly to a news alert:*

A few people stopped to watch alongside.

“What’s going on?” a man asked.

“I don’t know,” said Miller.

*On the screens, a handsome news reporter was solemnly reading out a statement about anti-government protests happening in some communist country in eastern Europe. “...they marched again today, in the hundreds of thousands, shouting, ‘We want bread! We want freedom!’ and holding signs denouncing the current regime and imploring the West—and the United States specifically—for help.”* There was more, but Miller had stopped listening. There rose a ***thumping-coursing*** followed by a ***ringing*** in his ears. And his eyes were focused on *the faces of the protestors in the photos and clips the news reporter was speaking over:* because they were his face: **all of them were his face!**

“Hey!” Miller yelled.

The people gathered at the electronics store window looked over at him. “You all right there, buddy?” one asked.

“Don’t you see: it’s me.”

“What’s you?”

“There—” He pointed with a shaking finger at one of the television sets. “—me.”

“Which one, honey?” a woman asked, chuckling.

Miller grabbed her by the shoulders, startling her, saying: “All of them. All of them are me.” And, looking back at the set, he started hitting the display window with his hand. “That one and that one, and that one. That one, that one, that one…”

He grew hysterical, violent; but the people on the street worked together to subdue him, and the owner of the electronics store called the police. The police picked him up, asked him a few questions and drove him to a mental institution. They suggested he stay here, “just for a few days, until you’re better,” and when he insisted he didn’t want to stay there, they changed their suggestion to a command backed by the law and threatened him with charges: assault, resisting arrest, loitering, vagrancy.

Donald Miller was in the institution when the President came on the television and in a serious address to the nation declared that the United States of America, a God fearing and freedom loving people, could no longer stand idly by while another people, equally deserving of freedom, yearning for it, was systematically oppressed. Those people, the President said, would now be saved and welcomed into the arms of the West. After that, the President declared war on the country in which Donald Miller had seen himself protesting against the government.

Once the shock of it passed, being committed wasn’t so bad. It was warm, there was free food and free television, and most of the nurses were nice enough. Sure, there were crazies in there, people who’d bang their heads against the wall or speak in made-up languages, but not everyone was like that, and it was easy to avoid the ones who were. The doctors were the worst part: not because they were cruel but because they were cold, and all they ever did was ask questions and make notes and never tell you what the notes were about. Eventually he even confided in one doctor, a young woman named Angeline, and told her the truth about what had happened to him. He talked to Angeline more often after that, which was fine with him. Then, unexpectedly, Angelina was gone and a man with a buzzcut came to talk to him. “Who are you?” Miller asked. “My name’s Fitzsimmons.” “Are you a doctor?” “No, I’m not a doctor. I work for the government.” “What do you want with me?” “To ask you some questions.” “You sound like a doctor, because that’s all they ever do: ask questions.” “Does that mean you won’t answer my questions?” “Can you get me out of here?” “Maybe.” “Depending on my answers?” “That’s right.” “So you’ll answer my questions?” asked Fitzsimmons. “Uh huh,” said Miller. “You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

The questions were bizarre and uncomfortable. Things like, *have you ever tortured an animal?* and *do you masturbate?* and *have you ever had sexual thoughts about someone in your immediate family?* 

Things like that, that almost made you want to dredge your own soul after. At one point, Fitzsimmons placed a dozen pictures of ink blots in front of Miller and asked him *which one of these best describes what you’d feel if I told you Dr. Angeline had been murdered?* When Miller picked one at random because he didn’t understand how what he felt corresponded to what was on the pictures, Fitzsimmons followed up with: *And what part of your body would you feel it in?* “I don’t know.” *Why not?* “Because it hasn’t happened so I haven’t felt it.” *How would you feel if you were the one who murdered her, Donald?* “Why would I do that?” *You murdered her, Donald.* “No.” *Donald, you murdered her and they’re going to put you away for a long long time—and not in a nice place like this but in a real facility with real hardened criminals.* “I didn’t fucking do it!” Miller screamed. “I didn’t fucking kill her! I didn’t—”

“Principal Lewis wants to see you in his office, Donald.”

Miller’s anger dissipated.

He sat now with his hands crossed calmly on his lap, looking at Fitzsimmons with a kind of blunt stupidity. “Did I do fine?” he asked.

“Yes, Donald. You did fine. Thank you for your patience,” said Fitzsimmons and left.

In the parking lot by the mental institution stood a black spook car with tinted windows. Fitzsimmons crossed from the main facility doors and got in. Spector sat in the driver’s seat. “How’d he do?” Spector asked.

“Borderline,” said Fitzsimmons.

“Explain.”

“It’s not that he couldn’t do it—I think he could. I just don’t have the confidence he’d keep it together afterwards. He’s fundamentally cracked. *All the king’s horses and all the king’s men,* you know?”

“That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as long as he *really* loses it.”

“That part’s manageable.”

“I hate to ask this favour, but you know how things are. The current administation—well, the budget’s just not there, which means the agency’s all about finding efficiencies. In that context, a re-used asset’s a real cost-saver.”

“OK,” said Fitzsimmons. “I’ll recommend it.”

“Thanks,” said Spector.

For Donald Miller, committed life went on. Doctor Angeline never came back, and nothing ever came of the Fitzsimmons interview, so Miller assumed he’d flubbed it. The other patients appeared and disappeared, never making much of an impression. Miller suffered through bouts of anxiety, depression and sometimes difficulty telling truth from fiction. The doctors had cured him of his initial delusion that he was actually hundreds of thousands of people in eastern Europe, but doubts remained. He simply learned to keep them internal. Then life got better. Miller made a friend, a new patient named Wellesley. Wellesley was also from Cincinatti, and the two of them got on splendidly. Finally, Miller had someone to talk to—to *really* talk to. As far as Miller saw it, Wellesley’s only flaw was that he was too interested in politics, always going on about international affairs and domestic policy, and how he hated the communists and hated the current administration for not being hard enough on them, and on internal communists, “because those are the worst, Donny. The scheming little rats that live among us.”

Miller didn’t say much of anything about that kind of stuff at first, but when he realized it made Wellesley happy to be humoured, he humoured him. He started repeating Wellesley’s statements to himself at night, and as he repeated them he started believing them. He read books that Wellesley gave him, smuggled into the institution by an acquaintance, like contraband. “And what’s *that* tell you about this great republic of ours? Land of the free, yet we can’t read everything we want to read.” Miller had never been interested in policy before. Now he learned how he was governed, oppressed, undermined by the enemy within. “There’s even some of that ilk in this hospital,” Wellesley told him one evening. “Some of the doctors and staff—they’re pure reds. I’ve heard them talking in the lounge about unions and racial justice.”

“I thought only poor people were communists,” said Miller.

“That’s what they want you to believe, so that if you ever get real mad about it you’ll turn on your fellow man instead of the real enemy: the one in power. Ain’t that a real mad fucking world. Everything’s all messed up. Like take—” Wellesley went silent and shook his head. A nurse walked by. “—no, nevermind, man. I don’t want to get you mixed up in anything.”

“Tell me,” Miller implored him.

“Like, well, take—take the President. He says all the right things in public, but that’s only to get elected. If you look at what he’s actually doing, like the policies and the appointments and where he spends *our* money, you can see his true fucking colours.”

Later they talked about revolutions, the American, the French, the Russian, and how if things got too bad the only way out was violence. “But it’s not always like that. The violence doesn’t have to be total. It can be smart, targeted. You take out the right person at the right time and maybe you save a million lives.

“Don’t you agree?” asked Wellesley.

“I guess...”

“Come on—you can be more honest than that. It’s just the two of us here. Two dregs of society that no one gives a shit about.”

“I agree,” said Miller.

Wellesley slapped him on the shoulder. “You know what?”

“What?”

“You’re a bright guy, Donald.”

Three months later, much to his surprise, Donald Miller was released from the mental institution he’d spent the last few years in. He even got a little piece of paper that declared him sane. He tried writing Wellesley a few times from the outside, but he never got a response. When he got up the courage to show up at the institution, he was told by a nurse that she shouldn’t be telling him this *but that Wellesley had taken his own life soon after Miller was released.*

Alone again, Donald Miller tried integrating into society, but it was tough going. He couldn’t make friends, and he couldn’t hold down a job. He was a hard worker but always too weird. People didn’t like him, or found him off-putting or creepy, or sometimes they intentionally made his life so unbearable he had to leave, then they pretended they were sorry to see him go. No one ever said anything true or concrete, like, “You stink,” or “You don’t shave regularly enough,” or “Your cologne smells cheap.” It was always merely hinted at, suggested. He was different. He didn’t belong. He felt unwelcome everywhere. His only solace was books, because books never judged him. He realized he hated the world around him, and whenever the President was on television, he hated the President too.

One day, Donald Miller woke up and knew exactly what he needed to do.

After all, he was a bright guy.

It was three weeks before Christmas. The snow was coming down slowly in big white flakes. The mood was magical, and Spector was sitting at a table in an upscale New York City restaurant with his wife and kids, ordering French wine and *magret de canard,* which was just a fancy French term for duck breast. The lighting was low so you could see winter through the big windows. A jazz band was playing something by Duke Ellington. Then the restaurant’s phone rang. Someone picked up. “Yes?” Somebody *whispered.* “Now?” asked the person who’d picked up the call. A commotion began, spreading from the staff to the diners and back to the staff, until someone turned a television on in the kitchen, and someone else dropped a glass, and a woman screamed as the glass shattered and a man yelled, “Oh my God, he’s been shot! The President’s been shot.”

At those words everyone in the restaurant jumped—*everyone but Spector,* who calmly swallowed the duck he’d been chewing, picked up his glass of wine and made a silent toast to the future of the agency.

The dinner was, understandably, cut short, and everyone made their way out to their cars to drive home through the falling snow. In his car, Spector assured his family that everything would be fine. Then he listened without comment as his wife and daughter exchanged uninformed opinions about *who would do such a terrible thing* and *what if we’re under attack* and *maybe it’s the Soviet Union…*

As he pulled into the street on which their hotel was located, Spector noticed a black car with tinted windows idling across from the hotel entrance. 

Passing, he waved, *and the car merged into traffic and drove obediently away.*

Fifteen years ago.

Nothing will ruin Mrs. Reema's mood this evening. Maybe one of her kids waking up dramatically, as usual, could do, but she refuses to think of that at the moment.


She opens the windows to let some of the chilly September breezes in, carrying along the scent of the neighbors' flowers, those which, just for the record, she had fought relentlessly time after time to have them removed, because her youngest child, Rami, was allergic. But now, she's just smiling, unlike her usual self, finding herself grateful for the fight she lost, and for the flowers she can finally smell.

In her right hand, she is holding a cup of coffee, while her left hand is clenched around a piece of chocolate that she had previously hidden from the children's reach. The silence that fills the room makes her realize that the children are fast asleep, so the tension leaks between her fingers, allowing her to open her hand and let the chocolate free. Something tiptoes into her soul, maybe happiness. Not just for the chocolate she can finally eat, but also for the idea of stillness that she rarely experiences these days.

What Mrs. Reema doesn't know yet is that this piece of chocolate is the last thing she will ever hide from anyone.

Mrs. Reema isn't a bad mother; on the contrary, she loves her children, all three of them. However, this peace of mind is rare in this house, as she assumes the roles of both mother and father, since her husband started working abroad to afford the luxurious level of life they're having.

Speaking of her husband, Mrs. Reema looks at the clock hanging above the TV, realizing that it's almost ten, which means that Mr. Fadi's weekly call is approaching.

She loves her husband a lot, though, thinking about it, she loves him way less than her children, but way more than a stranger man as well. She would've loved to tell her kids when they grow up, about the epic love story they went through, except, of course, there wasn't one. It was an arranged marriage, where a middle-aged woman assessed her physical and psychological traits, as Mrs. Reema would later tell herself, and decided that she would be a good wife for her son; and, truth be told, she was right.

She adjusts her posture to be close to the landline, placing her right leg on top of her left, and begins to swing her leg in an attempt to keep her patience in check.

With an eye on the phone and the other on the clock, she swirls her finger through the strand of hair falling on the side of her face.

As soon as the phone rings, she leaps in a swift motion towards it, not allowing it to destroy her victories by waking up the kids. This has become her favorite sport for the past five years.

For a good portion of time, before their phone call, she used to change her clothes, put on some blusher, and spray some perfume where Mr. Fadi used to kiss her. But later on, she realized that he couldn't see her and that lying was way easier.

""Hello ..."" his voice comes through the phone, and although she hears it every week, it sounds estranged.

""Hey Fadi,"" She answers with a failed attempt to make her voice warmer.

""How are you … and the kids?""""We're doing fine, what about you?""

""I missed you all, especially you, Reema.""

""We miss you too ..."" She shifts in her place restlessly, thinking about moments ago when she'd questioned her love for him, and now his voice is full of it.

""You told me that you'd cut your hair this week."" His voice carries a question, and something warm beneath it.

""Yeah, but I didn't find the time for it."" Silence stretches a moment too long. She was able to feel his disappointment through the static before breaking it, ""I have some news.""

""Is everybody okay?"" He asks worriedly.

""Don't worry, everyone's fine,"" she says calmly, ""we're gonna be six instead of five.""

Silence, again. This time, she is sure he didn't get the hint, so she decides to lay it clear.

""I'm pregnant,"" she says in an indifferent tone.

""Congratulations, Love,"" he says with a laugh, which made the sentence incoherent.

""Congratulations to us.""

From day one, Mr. Fadi said that he wanted to make a big family, ten kids, maybe twelve, who knows. And although she didn't mind back then, her desire to have children decreased after each pregnancy.

""We're having a daughter?"" he asks hopefully.

She rests a hand on her belly, ""I don't know. I'm only eight weeks in.""

To be fully honest, she also hopes for a daughter, as all of her children are boys. And the sooner she has a daughter, the sooner they decide to stop having more children. You see? She's not cold-hearted, but she has to think about her abilities as a mother first; she has to know where to draw the line.

For the next hour, their conversation branched out in many directions. In some cases, Mrs. Reema decided to elaborate, such as the color of the dress she was wearing, which she described while adjusting her pajamas. In others, she decided to keep it brief, as there's no need for him to know that Joe had fallen off the bed the night before, which resulted in a stitch in a place where his hair will grow soon. Or that the school called about Jack's low grades. She can fix all of that. What she can't fix is the psychiatrist appointment she took for Rami, her youngest, who has started to have strange, bloody dreams.

""I have to hang up now, the units are almost out."" Mr. Fadi announces, for which Mrs. Reema answers with a sigh that escaped her lips.

""Don't worry, darling, I'll be right beside you at the time of delivery.""

Mrs. Reema smiles for the first time during the call. She needed to hear that. ""I love you."" She whispers, although no one else is in the room.

""I love you too,"" and with that, he hangs up the phone.

She's glad that the call has ended by eleven, not that she was bored, but her favorite soap opera series is about to start. It had happened previously that the conversation made her miss the opening of episode number one hundred fifty-three, where one of the protagonists, whose name she had forgotten, announced his love under the rain.

She turns on the television after making sure that the living room's door is shut, so the sound won't reach her sleeping beauties inside. She sips her second cup of coffee, looking out the window, while waiting for the show to begin.

Amazement grips her as the scene unfolds before her. She doesn't know exactly when it happened. The cold breeze stops, and she starts to wipe away the beads of sweat that form on the edge of her nose repeatedly. The sky that was clear minutes ago is now full of shooting stars.

Mrs. Reema closes her eyes to make a wish; after all, one of the hundreds of shooting stars she's now seeing might make it come true. But before she can think about the wish, a sound from the television cuts the series's opening theme and is replaced by the news theme.

Her annoyance rapidly changes when she sees the face of the news anchor now on display. A handsome man in his forties, Nizar Yaghi. Her favorite TV personality. Actually, every woman's favorite TV personality.

He starts presenting in a smooth but professional tone:

""Ladies and gentlemen,

We are more than sorry to cut your favorite programs to broadcast the following announcement...""

He adjusts his tie while talking, leaving Mrs. Reema staring at his every movement. And after several moments, she realizes that she is licking her lips, and that she didn't hear a single word he said till now.

""The nature of the meteors remains unknown at the moment. While authorities have confirmed sightings of numerous meteors breaching the atmosphere, reports have surfaced of fiery objects crashing in various locations, including several countries in the Middle East, Canada, Brazil, and even a landfill site in India.

We urge citizens to remain indoors and follow safety orders. Do not touch any foreign objects until specialists arrive on the scene.

And in case you were wondering: No, you can't make a wish if a meteor lands next to you.

Someone in Canada already tried, and now he's wishing his eyebrows would grow back.""

He finishes the report with a satisfied smile about the joke he made at the end of it. And Mrs. Reema finds herself laughing out loud.

The clock is now pointing at midnight, or to be more specific, it's one minute to twelve.

In the next few seconds, everything will change. Not only here, not only in Mrs. Reema and her children's life alone, but life as we know it will change forever.

Mrs. Reema can feel the air vibrating around her. She looks out the window and sees the whole sky moving, except for one star.

The door behind her opens up, and she hears little steps behind her. She turns around to see that Rami is now awake and looking with tear-filled eyes for her in the room.

She turns back to the window and finds that the star is now larger. Rami bursts into tears as soon as he sees his mother, and she walks to hug him.

Although the lights are on, the room becomes brighter, which makes her look back at the sky searching for the source. Her eyes are now fixed at the window, from which she can see that the previously mentioned star is now the size of the moon. Or maybe bigger.

Every atom in her body begs her to look away, but she can't. She opens her eyes wider, realizing that what she's seeing is not a star, but a meteor falling towards her.

With a quick movement, thanks to the jumping-towards-the-phone sport, she picks Rami between her arms and runs towards the corridors, screaming the names of her three children to wake them up, forgetting that Rami is now screaming louder between her hands. She reaches their room, puts Rami on the ground, and reaches out to wake them.

It's exactly twelve now. A crashing sound rings through the air, and the whole building shakes, throwing Mrs. Reema to the ground.

The power went out across the entire neighborhood. And although it's expected to drown in darkness, the streets glow as they never before; lit by what had fallen moments ago in Mrs. Reema's yard, leaving behind a scent of burning that overpowers the fragrance of the neighbors' flowers.",2,1762566920.0,novelwriting,0,1.0,False

And when you're juggling multiple friend groups? Forget it. College friends, work people, hobby crews, your partner's friends. You're not antisocial, you're just exhausted by how much work it takes to do something that used to be effortless.

It didn't use to be this hard. You used to just knock on a door, show up at someone's dorm room. Now even getting together feels like a project.

So I built something to fix it.

Anyone in your friend groups can post an event—anything, big or small. Everyone gets notified. Everyone's invited by default. One place to see what's happening across all your groups.

No digging through five different group chats. No ""wait, did anyone tell them?"" No mental overhead about who to invite or whether it's worth mentioning.

Just: ""This is happening. You're invited.""

Coffee on Tuesday. Birthday dinner. Weekend trip. Movie night. Whatever. If someone in your group is doing something, you know about it. And you can actually show up to the things you'd want to be at.

I'm using it with my friends right now. It's free, it's in alpha, and I'm just trying to make it easier to spend time with the people you already care about.

If you're tired of friendships feeling like a part-time job, I'll drop the link in the comments.",3,1762566760.0,Adulting,1,1.0,False
1orcyh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1orcyh6/the_following_is_the_first_chapter_of_something_i/,"The following is the first chapter of something i started writing recently, I’d like your feedback.","Chapter one:

Fifteen years ago.

Nothing will ruin Mrs. Reema's mood this evening. Maybe one of her kids waking up dramatically, as usual, could do, but she refuses to think of that at the moment.


She opens the windows to let some of the chilly September breezes in, carrying along the scent of the neighbors' flowers, those which, just for the record, she had fought relentlessly time after time to have them removed, because her youngest child, Rami, was allergic. But now, she's just smiling, unlike her usual self, finding herself grateful for the fight she lost, and for the flowers she can finally smell.

In her right hand, she is holding a cup of coffee, while her left hand is clenched around a piece of chocolate that she had previously hidden from the children's reach. The silence that fills the room makes her realize that the children are fast asleep, so the tension leaks between her fingers, allowing her to open her hand and let the chocolate free. Something tiptoes into her soul, maybe happiness. Not just for the chocolate she can finally eat, but also for the idea of stillness that she rarely experiences these days.

What Mrs. Reema doesn't know yet is that this piece of chocolate is the last thing she will ever hide from anyone.

Mrs. Reema isn't a bad mother; on the contrary, she loves her children, all three of them. However, this peace of mind is rare in this house, as she assumes the roles of both mother and father, since her husband started working abroad to afford the luxurious level of life they're having.

Speaking of her husband, Mrs. Reema looks at the clock hanging above the TV, realizing that it's almost ten, which means that Mr. Fadi's weekly call is approaching.

She loves her husband a lot, though, thinking about it, she loves him way less than her children, but way more than a stranger man as well. She would've loved to tell her kids when they grow up, about the epic love story they went through, except, of course, there wasn't one. It was an arranged marriage, where a middle-aged woman assessed her physical and psychological traits, as Mrs. Reema would later tell herself, and decided that she would be a good wife for her son; and, truth be told, she was right.

She adjusts her posture to be close to the landline, placing her right leg on top of her left, and begins to swing her leg in an attempt to keep her patience in check.

With an eye on the phone and the other on the clock, she swirls her finger through the strand of hair falling on the side of her face.

As soon as the phone rings, she leaps in a swift motion towards it, not allowing it to destroy her victories by waking up the kids. This has become her favorite sport for the past five years.

For a good portion of time, before their phone call, she used to change her clothes, put on some blusher, and spray some perfume where Mr. Fadi used to kiss her. But later on, she realized that he couldn't see her and that lying was way easier.

""Hello ..."" his voice comes through the phone, and although she hears it every week, it sounds estranged.

""Hey Fadi,"" She answers with a failed attempt to make her voice warmer.

""How are you … and the kids?""""We're doing fine, what about you?""

""I missed you all, especially you, Reema.""

""We miss you too ..."" She shifts in her place restlessly, thinking about moments ago when she'd questioned her love for him, and now his voice is full of it.

""You told me that you'd cut your hair this week."" His voice carries a question, and something warm beneath it.

""Yeah, but I didn't find the time for it."" Silence stretches a moment too long. She was able to feel his disappointment through the static before breaking it, ""I have some news.""

""Is everybody okay?"" He asks worriedly.

""Don't worry, everyone's fine,"" she says calmly, ""we're gonna be six instead of five.""

Silence, again. This time, she is sure he didn't get the hint, so she decides to lay it clear.

""I'm pregnant,"" she says in an indifferent tone.

""Congratulations, Love,"" he says with a laugh, which made the sentence incoherent.

""Congratulations to us.""

From day one, Mr. Fadi said that he wanted to make a big family, ten kids, maybe twelve, who knows. And although she didn't mind back then, her desire to have children decreased after each pregnancy.

""We're having a daughter?"" he asks hopefully.

She rests a hand on her belly, ""I don't know. I'm only eight weeks in.""

To be fully honest, she also hopes for a daughter, as all of her children are boys. And the sooner she has a daughter, the sooner they decide to stop having more children. You see? She's not cold-hearted, but she has to think about her abilities as a mother first; she has to know where to draw the line.

For the next hour, their conversation branched out in many directions. In some cases, Mrs. Reema decided to elaborate, such as the color of the dress she was wearing, which she described while adjusting her pajamas. In others, she decided to keep it brief, as there's no need for him to know that Joe had fallen off the bed the night before, which resulted in a stitch in a place where his hair will grow soon. Or that the school called about Jack's low grades. She can fix all of that. What she can't fix is the psychiatrist appointment she took for Rami, her youngest, who has started to have strange, bloody dreams.

""I have to hang up now, the units are almost out."" Mr. Fadi announces, for which Mrs. Reema answers with a sigh that escaped her lips.

""Don't worry, darling, I'll be right beside you at the time of delivery.""

Mrs. Reema smiles for the first time during the call. She needed to hear that. ""I love you."" She whispers, although no one else is in the room.

""I love you too,"" and with that, he hangs up the phone.

She's glad that the call has ended by eleven, not that she was bored, but her favorite soap opera series is about to start. It had happened previously that the conversation made her miss the opening of episode number one hundred fifty-three, where one of the protagonists, whose name she had forgotten, announced his love under the rain.

She turns on the television after making sure that the living room's door is shut, so the sound won't reach her sleeping beauties inside. She sips her second cup of coffee, looking out the window, while waiting for the show to begin.

Amazement grips her as the scene unfolds before her. She doesn't know exactly when it happened. The cold breeze stops, and she starts to wipe away the beads of sweat that form on the edge of her nose repeatedly. The sky that was clear minutes ago is now full of shooting stars.

Mrs. Reema closes her eyes to make a wish; after all, one of the hundreds of shooting stars she's now seeing might make it come true. But before she can think about the wish, a sound from the television cuts the series's opening theme and is replaced by the news theme.

Her annoyance rapidly changes when she sees the face of the news anchor now on display. A handsome man in his forties, Nizar Yaghi. Her favorite TV personality. Actually, every woman's favorite TV personality.

He starts presenting in a smooth but professional tone:

""Ladies and gentlemen,

We are more than sorry to cut your favorite programs to broadcast the following announcement...""

He adjusts his tie while talking, leaving Mrs. Reema staring at his every movement. And after several moments, she realizes that she is licking her lips, and that she didn't hear a single word he said till now.

""The nature of the meteors remains unknown at the moment. While authorities have confirmed sightings of numerous meteors breaching the atmosphere, reports have surfaced of fiery objects crashing in various locations, including several countries in the Middle East, Canada, Brazil, and even a landfill site in India.

We urge citizens to remain indoors and follow safety orders. Do not touch any foreign objects until specialists arrive on the scene.

And in case you were wondering: No, you can't make a wish if a meteor lands next to you.

Someone in Canada already tried, and now he's wishing his eyebrows would grow back.""

He finishes the report with a satisfied smile about the joke he made at the end of it. And Mrs. Reema finds herself laughing out loud.

The clock is now pointing at midnight, or to be more specific, it's one minute to twelve.

In the next few seconds, everything will change. Not only here, not only in Mrs. Reema and her children's life alone, but life as we know it will change forever.

Mrs. Reema can feel the air vibrating around her. She looks out the window and sees the whole sky moving, except for one star.

The door behind her opens up, and she hears little steps behind her. She turns around to see that Rami is now awake and looking with tear-filled eyes for her in the room.

She turns back to the window and finds that the star is now larger. Rami bursts into tears as soon as he sees his mother, and she walks to hug him.

Although the lights are on, the room becomes brighter, which makes her look back at the sky searching for the source. Her eyes are now fixed at the window, from which she can see that the previously mentioned star is now the size of the moon. Or maybe bigger.

Every atom in her body begs her to look away, but she can't. She opens her eyes wider, realizing that what she's seeing is not a star, but a meteor falling towards her.

With a quick movement, thanks to the jumping-towards-the-phone sport, she picks Rami between her arms and runs towards the corridors, screaming the names of her three children to wake them up, forgetting that Rami is now screaming louder between her hands. She reaches their room, puts Rami on the ground, and reaches out to wake them.

It's exactly twelve now. A crashing sound rings through the air, and the whole building shakes, throwing Mrs. Reema to the ground.

The power went out across the entire neighborhood. And although it's expected to drown in darkness, the streets glow as they never before; lit by what had fallen moments ago in Mrs. Reema's yard, leaving behind a scent of burning that overpowers the fragrance of the neighbors' flowers.",1,1762566638.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

The following information comes from entries provided by Inspector Eleanor Darcy and her partner, Inspector Harris McKenzie. Both were agents with Project Inferno during the late 19th century.



Project Inferno was an experimental program overseen by several prominent political figures. It would be adapted into the Bureau of Investigation (BOI) by Attorney General Charles J. Bonaparte before coming under the management of Attorney General George W. Wickersham in 1909. The Bureau of Investigation would later become what we now know as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).



This forerunner experimental program, known as Project Inferno, aligned renowned detectives with criminal-coded individuals to assist local police departments across America. Since it transitioned into a more legitimate agency, Project Inferno has been forgotten due to its morally questionable decisions and lack of government regulation.



The following entries from Inspector Darcy and Inspector McKenzie detail a brief glimpse of how this program functioned. These entries have been updated to adhere to contemporary English. Translation errors have been accounted for, but the story remains relatively the same nonetheless.



Legally, this piece must be promoted as fictitious. Everything you are about to read may or may not have happened. The final verdict will be left up to the reader's interpretation to determine the validity of these events.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**CHAPTER 1.**

*Sunday, October 4, 1981; Inspector Harris McKenzie*



Believe nothing you hear, and only one half that you see. Edgar Allan Poe wrote that in one of his stories. I couldn’t help but think about that quote as I rode on the train.



My personal cabin was cemented in darkness. Shutters drawn, door closed, lights off. It was only me and my thoughts. The bustle of the train car. The smell of percolating coffee and burning tobacco.



The outside world existed. I knew this without a shadow of a doubt. I’m not so naive to believe otherwise. But in that moment, when you’re inside the abyss, can you really be sure?



Believe nothing you hear, and only half that you see. What do you believe when you can’t see anything, though?



The cabin door opened. Lantern light poured into the room, sending the shadows into a frenzy. Inspector Darcy stood in the doorway. She was tan with thick black hair pushed back on her head. A hard jaw and broad shoulders. Long of leg with a lean frame.



Most agents with the program mistook her for a man at first glimpse. The fact that she wore a suit didn’t help this matter. Inspector Darcy’s choice of attire and occupation was the source of much animosity and debate. A scandal of sorts. Minimal, if you ask me, but from the perspective of others, it was an urgent matter. One requiring almost too much conversation and focus.



While Inspector Darcy tried to conceal her exasperation, especially when we were out in the field, I could still see it.



Those thoughts. Those stares. They bothered her. No matter how hard she tried to ignore them. I couldn't blame her. It would bother me too. But as Hume once said: Prejudice is destructive of sound judgment, and perverts all operations of the intellectual faculties.



There is no greater tragedy than that of bias impairing sound judgement. Unfortunately, our society is prone to bias, and as a result, our judgement is greatly impaired. Especially when it comes to tradition and reason.



“We’ll be arriving soon,” Inspector Darcy said, hanging the lantern on a nearby hook. “Get your things ready.”



“Yes, ma’am.”



I grabbed my luggage from the overhead compartment and followed her out to the lounge area. We sat across from each other and watched the landscape pass by in a blur of colors. The city came into view. Shrouded by mist. Both from the dew and the industrial smokestacks.



“Want one?” Inspector Darcy asked, opening a new carton of Sweet Caporal cigarettes.



With the carton came a collector’s card featuring Maude Adams. Some stage actress. I didn’t recognize her, but I also wasn’t one for theater productions or actors. Most of my entertainment came from books.



Inspector Darcy lit her cigarette before lighting mine. We sat in momentary silence, listening to the whistles and bells of the train as we came into the station. Outside, rain streaked across the windows. A storm was approaching.



The other passengers rose, quick to get off the train. We waited in our seats while everyone departed. Inspector Darcy slipped on a hooded rain cape. I retrieved a bottle of laudanum from my luggage and swallowed about a teaspoon.



“I thought I told you to ease back on that,” she said.



“Counselor’s orders,” I said, but honestly, it didn’t matter whether the counselor prescribed it or not. I would’ve kept taking laudanum.



“It clouds your mind,” she said. “I need you clear.”



“It takes off the edge,” I countered. “You wouldn’t want me to act impulsively, would you?”



She scoffed. “That trick won’t work on me anymore, Harris. Cut back or I’ll be forced to write you up.”



The last of the passengers stepped off the train. We rose from our seats and started down the walkway toward the nearest exit.



At the station, we were met by the Chief of Police, Burris McPherson. A portly man with greying hair. He wore the regular navy blue police uniform most officers donned. A polished badge hung from his left side. A revolver was holstered on his right hip, and a baton on his left.



“Chief Burris,” Darcy said. “Inspector Eleanor Darcy.” She gestured to me. “My partner, Inspector Harris McKenzie.”



He nodded indifferently. “Private hackshaws from upstate. Heard a lil’ through the grapevine about your operation. Which one of you is the lunatic?”



I raised my hand. “I’d be the mutt, sir.”



“Just so you know, we’ll be keepin’ a close eye on you,” he said. “One false move, we’ll put you down, boy. We’ve got a signed warrant to make it official and everything.”



It was hard not to laugh. That warrant wasn’t anything new. Inspector Darcy had one. As did every other inspector part of Project Inferno. If his goal was to intimidate me, he should’ve fired on sight. Might’ve made both our lives easier.



“Understood, sir,” I said. “Shall we get to the undertaker’s office now?”



At this, the chief grimaced. “About that, we might have to make a quick stop along the way. There’s been a recent development.”



“How recent?” Inspector Darcy asked.



“Within the last hour or so.”



I glanced at the inspector. We were thinking the same thing: this killer’s working fast.



With our luggage in tow, we piled into a carriage and started through the city. It was your run-of-the-mill metropolis. Tall brick buildings packed close together. Overcrowded streets. Smog and sickness in the air. People on the sidewalks. Most dressed in rags and covered in soot. But as we advanced north, their clothes became nicer, and their skin cleaner.



“Are you sure this murder is connected with the other two?” Inspector Darcy asked the chief.



He nodded. “Left the message behind as he did with the other crime scenes. That piece of evidence hasn’t been released to the press yet.”



“There goes any hope of a copycat,” I muttered. “Whose our most recent victim?”



“Johnson Ullers,” he said. “Owner of a few plants in the area. Members of his staff found him at one of his steel mills.”



“Any connection to the other victims?”



The other two victims were Richard Howards, a wealthy investor from New York looking to spread his wings; and Thomas Banks, a local land agent with a monopoly on most real estate in the area. Especially farm land on the outskirts of the city.



“Far as we can tell, no established connections,” the chief said. “But in Wormwood, everyone’s connected. We started as a small farming community after all.”



“And look at you now,” I said.



“Watch it, dog. This city ain’t perfect, but at least we don’t let criminals run free.”



“Could’ve fooled me.”



“Chief,” Inspector Darcy interjected, “tell us more about the crime scene.”



He glanced out the window. The carriage driver hollered at the horses, and we came to a gradual stop.



“I won’t have to tell you,” he said. “Might as well take a look for yourselves. But I should warn you, it’s not a pretty sight. ‘specially for a lady.”



“I’ll manage,” I said.



The chief glared at me, and Inspector Darcy refrained from reacting. I couldn’t tell if she wanted to laugh or scold me. Probably both.



We exited the carriage and entered the steel mill. The air stank of copper and coal. But it was quiet. With the murder, the entire staff had been given a day off. First time for everything.



We were led to the main floor, where a majority of the machinery was housed. Conveyor systems to transport raw materials. Darkened furnaces overflowing with ashes. Moisture trickled from the pipes overhead. Blood splattered against the floor.



Inside the workshop were several officers and five men. Workers covered from head to toe in grease and sweat. Their hands were caked with blood. One of them, the youngest of the lot, had swollen eyes as if he’d been crying.



The victim, Johnson Ullers, hung a few inches off the ground. Suspended by a trolley hook through his back. His torso was lined with deep lacerations. Some exposed inner muscle, a few even showed bone. Strangest of all, though, was his face. Mutilated beyond recognition.



A younger woman with long red hair inspected the body. She wore heavy-duty rubber boots and gloves with a leather apron. Metal instruments peered out from the center pocket.



“Inspectors,” the chief said, “this is Syla Barret, our local surgeon. She’s been helping with the crime scene due to the Undertaker Barret’s declining health.”



“Father?” I asked.



“My uncle,” she said, smiling. “His age has gotten the best of him. Can’t leave the office much these days.”



“Let’s get the body down so we can inspect it,” Darcy said. To the chief, she said, “Separate and isolate the witnesses. We’ll question them one by one in a few minutes.”



“We’ll start with the oldest,” I said. “Finish with the youngest. Make sure they don’t talk to each other until after we’ve interviewed them.”



The chief relayed the orders to his officers while we worked with the surgeon in preparing the body for transport.



“The victim is Johnson Ullers,” the surgeon recounted clinically. “Fifty-two, male, caucasian. Multiple stab wounds about the abdomen and chest. Most likely died from hemorrhaging.”



She moved about with expertise. As if this was nothing new. I’m not one to complain about a dead body. Darcy and I had seen our fair share during our time with Project Inferno, but the smell was starting to encroach. Feces and decay. I lit another cigarette to keep it at bay.



“The victim has bruising around the neck,” the surgeon continued. “Discoloration in the face. The victim was strangled. Suspension cut off circulation—”



“Open his eyes,” I said.



The surgeon stopped and looked back at me. Inspector Darcy nodded, and the chief gave her approval to continue. The surgeon peeled back the victim’s eyelids. The sockets were empty.



“The victim’s eyes were gouged out,” she said, moving her fingers down to his lips. “Tongue was severed as well. Looks like it was removed with a straight-edge blade. Possibly a shaving razor or a scalpel or maybe surgical scissors.”



“And the ears?” I asked.



She paused to collect herself before turning the head from one side to the other, showing us the profile of the victim’s face. His ears were missing. From the looks of it, they’d been partially sawed at until the killer grew impatient and ripped them off.



Chief Burris pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and dabbed at his brow. He began to pace, shaking his head while muttering prayers under his breath. Some of the other officers retreated, looking a little green around the gills.



A sight like that makes your stomach twist itself into knots. Makes your chest tight. But for me, I was curious. Why take the eyes, tongue, and ears while leaving everything else intact? Trophies, maybe. Our killer was either deeply disturbed or trying to get at something.



“You mentioned the killer had left a message,” Inspector Darcy said, lighting another cigarette for herself.



Chief Burris led us away from the body to the back of the room. On the far wall, written in blood, was: ‘My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings; Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!’



“Why does this sound familiar?” Inspector Darcy asked. “It’s from something, right?”



“It’s a line from a sonnet,” I said. “Ozymandias by Percy Bysshe Shelley. I read it in a collection of his poems, ‘Rosalind and Helen’.”



“Percy Shelley, he was—”



“The husband of Mary Shelley. She wrote a few books, most notably ‘Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus’ back when she was maybe eighteen or nineteen. Died about a decade before the war.”



“And him?”



“Dead too. Drowned in a boating accident, I believe.”



“Were you a professor or something?” Chief Burris asked, his disgust apparent.



“He likes books,” Inspector Darcy answered for me. She quickly moved on. “Chief, how exactly was the body discovered?”



He dragged the handkerchief across his face, but he couldn’t wipe away his apprehension. His hesitation only made me more curious. The air grew thick with tension. He was hiding something.



“Those five you saw before aren’t just witnesses,” he admitted. “They’re accomplices.”



“Accomplices?” Inspector Darcy remarked. “Is there a reason they’re not in irons?”



“It’s complicated. They said someone came in late last night. Only shift managers were still on the clock. They held the men at gunpoint and forced them to…well, you saw the body for yourselves.”



How convenient. Men working hard labor were forced to murder their boss. A fantasy I’m sure plenty have on a daily basis. Whether they care to admit it or not. But I couldn’t say that aloud. Not without enduring the wrath of Chief Burris and the disappointment of Inspector Darcy.



“We need to question those men, immediately,” Darcy said. “We’ll also need the accountant’s records.”



“Are you tax auditors now too?” Chief Burris asked.



“We’re just being thorough.”",1,1762566452.0,DrCreepensVault,0,1.0,False

However about 10 days ago I had pelvic surgery for prolapse (probably because of kids, constipation and hysterectomy) i am really really backed up. When I got its just a little ball, maybe 2 and they hurt coming out. Bad. 

Im not ""allowed"" to strain. Bear down. None. So ...my poop is suppose to...just fall out. 

2 weeks before my surgery i took colace. Upped my fruit and veggie intake and water. Well, a few days before surgery I started getting constipated. Great. 

Ive taken miralax, milk of magnesia, magnesium citrate, fruits, veggies, fiber powder, activia yogurt, strong coffee, warmed prune juice and after 5 or 6 days i had a bowel movement. Barely. Everyday since its just been those small ball shape. Hurts to get out. Im not suppose to push soooo.....(i do have a squatty potty i use and correct posture) 

I just did one of those mini enema. I was scared to do it (because of surgery and the no push or anything like that and I know im backed up) I got half of the solution in and chickened out. The solution only stayed in maybe 5 seconds (i rolled over to try to get off the floor) and well....im certain it all came out.

She was wearing that gray sweater she always stole from me, the one that still smells like her shampoo. We sat in my car behind the grocery store just talking about nothing for a while. The kind of small talk you use when you’re both trying not to cry.

She said she couldn’t do it anymore. That it wasn’t fair to anyone. As much as it hurt and I wanted it to continue, I knew she was right. But when she touched my hand, my chest went tight. I wanted to ask her to stay, even though I’d promised I wouldn’t if she got to this point.

Now it’s just quiet. The kind of quiet that feels heavy. I still check my phone too much. I still half expect to see her name pop up on the screen, even though I know it won’t.

It’s weird what you miss. The way she teased me about my terrible coffee habit. How she’d hum to herself when she was focused. The way she’d text me goodnight with a random emoji that never made sense.

I told myself it was only supposed to be temporary, something simple, something that wouldn’t leave a mark. But it did.

Anyway, I guess I just needed to say it somewhere. It’s strange how someone can walk into your life quietly, and leave just the same way, and somehow everything feels different after.

As he’s yelling at me for starting a fight, I start crying while going about my morning hygiene routine followed by going into another room and practicing grounding techniques. For context, I’m currently sick and have laryngitis so communicating with him is hard.  

He apologized for yelling at me and said I didn’t  deserve it, but another fight ensued when I wanted to borrow his car to go back to my apartment with my two dog and my overnight bags. Typically, he’s offered for me to use his car anytime I want and has offered to retrieve it from my apartment so that I don’t have to bring it back to him. I expected that same courtesy on this day despite the fight. After back and forth, he grabbed his key and stuck it in his pocket telling me that I could leave my things and my dogs behind because he would bring them back to me later. I refused because he’s withheld my wallet from me before and made me jump through hoops to get it back from him and I didn’t trust that he wouldn’t weaponize my dogs.  

Anyway, when he told me I couldn’t borrow his car and could leave on my own without my pups, I smacked his to-go cup of coffee out of his hand and onto the floor. He then hit me across my face, proceeded to clean up the coffee without checking on me, and continued yelling at me and calling me names. Eventually he drove us home, apologized for hitting me (I apologized for hitting his coffee) and he offered to drive me to the ER to get my jaw checked because I was having trouble opening and closing my mouth without pain. I refused and ignored his outreach. 

The next day, I drove myself to the ER for a CT scan and to document my injuries. I have a concussion but no dislocation or fracture. I got another message from him and I responded that I went to the ER and have a concussion. His response was ‘thanks for letting me know.’ I  highlighted his lack of empathy and he said that he apologized yesterday and would only show remorse in person or on a phone call, but not written. 

This is not the first time he’s been violent with me—it’s just the worst injury. After the second time, I left him for almost a year while he started therapy twice a week and a medication regimen. 

We had a trip planned together to a new country and I’m so angry that I have to go forgo this trip because it feels like I’m punishing myself since he will still go. I thought about getting my own hotel and moving my flight to avoid him so I still get to go, but I don’t know if that’s ultimately respecting myself enough. 

I’m debating reaching out to his family and friends with the hopes that outing him helps me reclaim my power and autonomy because he has this perfect image on the outside while being abusive behind closed doors. My family and friends know everything and his circle knows nothing—so I want there to be that consequence especially if I don’t go through with a police report for personal reasons. 

TLDR: my ex partner and I got into a fight during which I hit his coffee out of his hand and he hit me across my face in return. I’m angry about the loss of a planned vacation and am debating how to empower myself in terms of my next steps regarding outing him to his friends and family and/or filing a police report.

Once I got out of the pod at the buried city, I started playing and couldn't stop. I wasn't too focused on getting loot this run, I had to spread this groove to all willing ears. I ran into another raider almost immediately and I didn't even need say a word, my recorder did all the talking. 

We went to the hospital together and there were shots pooping off and l played some tunes for the nice folks dancing together in the upper floors. As I was filling my bag with sensors, I ran into another raider holding his Torrente staring menacingly, but I stared back and played my recorder to match his energy as we went our separate ways.

My bag was getting full, so I started heading to the subway. Peaking around a corner, I saw another raider trying to be sneaky, but he wasn't sneaky enough for the birds. So I played a little ditty about the birds he just disturbed and he came by and thanked me for the tunes.

I played the recorder walking all way the subway and up to the computer, and while sending my passcode to Shani, I was gunned down. His ears weren't willing.

Luckily, her rescue ops carried me back to Speranza that night. The next run up the surface, I left the recorder in the shelf and brought a few extra heavy fuse grenades instead.",5,1762565650.0,ArcRaiders,0,1.0,False

Somewhere between our first coffee and our last doom-scroll, we convince ourselves we “need” something new.

But this isn’t random — it’s engineered.

My new long-form essay explores how capitalism, credit, and social media have trapped humanity in a loop of consumption, debt, and comparison — and how Islamic ethics offer a forgotten blueprint for balance, moderation, and freedom.

Key points:

* The “Buy Now, Pay Later” illusion and debt as social control.
* Social media as the new religion of self.
* Capitalism’s addiction to dissatisfaction.
* Why Islamic economics — based on justice, zakat, and restraint — offers a way out.
* How to reclaim your consciousness from the consumption cycle.

1orcker,https://www.reddit.com/r/llivo/comments/1orcker/why_hosts_should_stop_copypasting_descriptions/,Why Hosts Should Stop Copy-Pasting Descriptions From Other Listings,"In the world of **short-term rentals**, your listing description is your voice—it’s how you tell travelers what makes your property unique. But far too often, hosts fall into the trap of copying descriptions from other listings, thinking it will save time or help them “sound professional.” The problem? Guests can tell. And when your words feel generic or duplicated, you lose what matters most: **authenticity**.

Platforms like Llivo value originality because travelers do. When every other listing starts with “a cozy and modern apartment in the heart of the city,” guests stop noticing who you are and what makes your space special. If you want your property to stand out among hundreds of similar ones, you need a voice that’s truly yours.

Discover how to create a listing that feels real and personal through[ **Luxury Vacation Rentals**](https://www.llivo.com/p/luxury-vacation-rentals) — where hosts learn how to write and present their properties with honesty, clarity, and charm.



https://preview.redd.it/jjcoehz6sxzf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=f430f27894f92239c6a391240a73724d1741feed

# The Problem With Copy-Paste Descriptions

When guests browse online, they’re not just looking for a bed—they’re imagining an experience. If your description sounds too similar to another, it instantly feels like a **template**, not a home. This creates doubt. Guests might wonder if your photos are real or if the property even exists as described.

Beyond that, **search algorithms** on modern booking platforms detect repeated text. That means your copied content may rank lower in searches compared to listings written with unique descriptions. In short: copying doesn’t just hurt your credibility—it hurts your visibility.

And remember, your words are often the first interaction a guest has with you. If that first impression is unoriginal, it’s hard to build trust later.



# How To Avoid Copying — and Find Your Own Voice

**1. Write from your guest’s perspective.**  
 Imagine what they’d feel when they walk in. Describe sensory details—what they’ll smell, see, or hear. A few honest lines like “Morning sunlight floods the living room” sound far more genuine than a copied sentence about “bright and airy spaces.”

**2. Keep it personal and specific.**  
 Instead of saying “near restaurants and shops,” write, “Just two blocks from Bella’s Café, where locals grab morning coffee.” Small, real details build connections.

**3. Use your own story.**  
 Was this your first home? Did you decorate it with your favorite finds from travels? Share it briefly. Guests connect to **real hosts**, not corporate voices.

**4. Focus on clarity, not perfection.**  
 You don’t need fancy language—guests prefer warmth and readability. Break your description into short, friendly sentences. Avoid over-promising.

**5. Refresh your listing regularly.**  
 Trends change, and so should your words. Update your highlights seasonally—mention nearby events, decor updates, or local experiences.

If you’re unsure where to start, Llivo helps hosts refine their listings to reflect their **true personality and hospitality style**. Explore more through[ Llivo Benefits](https://www.llivo.com/p/llivo-benefits) to see how authentic storytelling can lead to stronger guest connections and more consistent bookings.



# The Real-World Impact of Authentic Writing

One Llivo host shared how, after rewriting her copied description into her own words, her booking rate increased by 30%. Guests commented that her listing “felt warm and real” compared to others in the area. That’s the power of an honest voice—it builds emotional trust.

Guests aren’t just renting a space; they’re choosing a **story they want to step into**. And when your listing tells that story authentically, it doesn’t just get viewed—it gets booked.

Learn more about refining your property’s identity and communication style through Llivo’s guide on[ Maximizing Rental Income](https://www.llivo.com/p/maximize-rental-income).



# FAQs

**Q1: What’s the biggest mistake when writing a listing description?**  
 Copying from others or using generic language. Guests scroll past listings that sound identical.

**Q2: How long should my description be?**  
 Short enough to keep attention—about 150–200 words—but rich in **specific details** and personality.

**Q3: Can AI help write descriptions?**  
 Yes, but personalize it! Always review and adjust AI-written content so it reflects your property’s real tone and story.

**Q4: Why does authenticity matter so much?**  
 Because it builds emotional trust. Travelers are more likely to book with someone who feels real and genuine, not scripted.



# Final Words

Every home has a story—your story. And the best listings are the ones that tell it honestly. Copying descriptions may save time, but it costs you connection, trust, and ultimately, bookings.

With Llivo, you don’t have to blend in. You can stand out with authenticity, warmth, and clarity that travelers remember. Create your voice, tell your story, and turn browsers into guests who feel something real.

1orckcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/coldbrew/comments/1orckcs/oxo_cold_brew_coffee_maker_ratio_help/,OXO Cold Brew Coffee Maker ratio [HELP],"I'm so retarded I feel like that after trying to understand how to save money and make my coffee without storing too much (idk if this goes bad stored too long) and of course not using too much of my resources.

I bought a 16 oz bag of coarse coffee for $20 and want to make this go as far as I can.

The coffee maker for OXO for those unfamiliar is 10oz coffee + 40oz water = 24-28oz of concentrate.

The ration of water/milk is 1:2 or 1:3 to start (as per manual recommendations) > I assume this also includes creamer as well.

I usually would get a small at Dunkin which I think is about 12oz of Coffee so would I be correct that in order to get a 12oz brew I'd use 4oz of concentrate and 8oz of creamer on a 1:2? That seems like a lot considering I have 32oz of creamer.

I just don't want to brew nearly my entire 16oz bag of coffee I just purchased. The manual said that for roughly 10oz of coffee and 40oz of water it makes 14-16 drinks.

Do I also use 40oz of water no matter the ratio of coffee used or if I use perhaps 5oz instead of 10oz I use 20oz of water?

Really hoping for more experienced cold brew veterans to help in my first venture into making it at home. Sorry if this is rather long.

1orci72,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrowverse/comments/1orci72/au_story_the_violet_knight_part_15/,AU Story: The Violet Knight Part 15,"The midday sun beat down on the sparkling waters of the Wayne Manor pool. Ellie & Mia were both perched on the edge, their legs submerged, an easy silence hanging between them, the kind that only comes with a shared, deep-seated grief and an inherited superhero legacy.

“I still can’t quite picture it,” Mia finally said, kicking her feet, sending up a little splash that caught the sunlight.

“Diana was so earnest, too. Like she was sharing a sacred text.”
Ellie smirked, leaning back on her hands. 

“Well, to her, it probably is. The thought of Bruce and your dad… Green Arrow and Batman… just being dads. Not even heroes, just two guys stressing about party planning.”

“Right? In the League’s observation room, no less! Full suits, cowl and mask on,” Mia shook her head, a small, genuine smile curving her lips. “Talking about giant number balloons and what kind of cake frosting wouldn’t stain the carpet. God, can you imagine the look on Clark’s face if he walked in on that?”

Ellie let out a bright, unrestrained laugh that echoed slightly off the tiled pool deck. “Oh, that’s beautiful. That’s truly a perfect mental image.” She paused, the laughter fading into a soft, wistful sigh. “It’s weird, isn’t it? Knowing that somewhere, in that big building… they weren't two superheroes. They were just Oliver and Bruce figuring out how to make our child selves happy. Smiling and laughing about us.”

Mia nudged Ellie’s arm gently with her elbow. “It explains a lot, honestly. “It makes them feel… closer, doesn’t it? Those little private moments. The ones that had nothing to do with saving the world and everything to do with just being ours.”

“It does,” Ellie agreed softly. “And it means that even when they were wearing the suits, even when they were out there being legends… we were their secret mission. The most important one.”

The sun warmed their faces as they sat there, two young women, the inheritors of two great legacies, sharing a silent, powerful moment of understanding. 

The sun was still high, but the brightness in the atmosphere seemed to dim slightly as the gravity of their conversation settled over them again.

Ellie sighed, the sound soft but profound. She leaned forward, resting her chin on her drawn-up knees, the purple ruffles of her bikini feeling suddenly fragile. ""I wish they were still here.""

Mia immediately shifted, closing the small gap between them. She gently rested her head on Ellie’s shoulder, a gesture that was both comforting and bracing.

""I know,"" Mia murmured, her voice a low, steady hum. ""We all do. But they made the ultimate choice, protecting others. My dad did it in the Multiverse Crisis, sacrificing himself to make sure the world, and our family, got a tomorrow.”

Ellie closed her eyes for a moment, letting the warmth of Mia’s head anchor her.
""And Bruce,"" Mia continued, her tone softening with a reverence only another legacy kid could truly understand. ""He did it that night in ACE Chemicals to allow you to escape the collapsing structure while he made sure the Joker couldn't take anyone else with him. He was Bruce, but at that moment, he was also just a dad making sure his little girl got time to get out of there.""

Ellie & Mia had gotten changed into comfy clothes and were sitting on Ellie's bed with panic puppies. Sara had called Ellie.

Ellie asks, “Hey Mom, what's up?”

""My flight landed a little while ago. I'm coming to have some of those fuzzy, flannel cuddles."" Sara answered.

""You're here?"" Ellie asked, her pink-rimmed glasses wide with surprise.

Mia shot up, making Koda shift sleepily. ""Seriously? You’re in Gotham?""

Sara chuckled. ""I am. Give me fifteen minutes and I'll meet you two in the kitchen. I owe you a movie night with much better snacks than whatever Alfred stocked the pantry with.""

Ellie and Mia exchanged a look of pure, delighted shock.
""You're actually here!"" Ellie squealed, scrambling off the bed.

""Yes! Get ready, Cubbie. I'll text when I'm pulling up the drive,"" Sara confirmed.

""Love you, Mom! Drive safe!"" Ellie called out before ending the call.

Ellie and Mia instantly sprang into action, a whirlwind of flannel and enthusiasm. They scooped up the puppies, rushing them out for a quick, snowy backyard bathroom break, then tore downstairs to the kitchen. They quickly grabbed a mixing bowl to whip up a batch of instant hot cocoa and hunted through the rarely-touched high cabinets for the good shortbread cookies that only appeared when Alfred was feeling particularly fond of them.

A few minutes later, the sleek, low purr of a rental Mustang sliced through the quiet winter air as Sara Lance pulled up to the main entrance of Wayne Manor. The snow was falling thicker now, dusting the grand estate in white.

Alfred opened the door just as Sara approached, a serene look on his face.
""Mistress Sara, welcome. We hadn't expected you.""

""Plans change, Alfred,"" Sara said, handing him a small duffel bag.

Alfred simply smiled, his eyes twinkling. ""Indeed. The Manor is unusually quiet.""

Sara’s curiosity nudged her. She quietly made her way up the grand staircase. The Manor truly was silent. She paused at Ellie’s open door and poked her head in.

The scene was one of total, peaceful surrender. Ellie and Mia hadn't made it past the waiting. They were sound asleep, sprawled together on the bed under the comforter. Their bodies were intertwined in a loose, protective cuddle, the soft flannel of their pajamas a mix of purple, pink, green, and black. Duke and Koda had taken the cue from their owners, now curled up in a single, furry black and white mound at the foot of the bed, their snores the only sound in the room.

Sara’s heart swelled. She gently closed the door, a small, genuine smile on her face.
She checked the other rooms. In Damian's room, the notoriously prickly young man and Rachel were also sound asleep, Rachel tucked into his side, a shared intensity even in their rest. Finally, Tara was curled up peacefully in her own room, a half-read book resting on her chest.

Letting out a soft breath, Sara retraced her steps, heading down the back stairs and into the kitchen. Alfred was meticulously cleaning a nonexistent smudge on the stainless steel counter.

""Looks like it's a lazy day for the kids,"" Sara chuckled, leaning against the door frame, feeling a wave of unexpected tranquility wash over her.

Alfred paused his wiping, looking up at her with warmth. ""A well-deserved rest, I believe, Mistress Sara. It seems the cocoa and cookies will have to wait for the morning.""

The guest room at Wayne Manor was stately but subdued, offering a temporary calm away from the world's chaos. Sara, now wearing comfortable pajamas, was propped against the pillows of the massive bed. A pair of elegant, gold-framed glasses rested on her nose as she flipped a page in a well-worn novel.
The soft chime of her phone pulled her from the text. She picked it up, smiling faintly as she saw the contact name.

""I made it,"" Sara said simply, her voice low and content.

A bright, familiar voice answered immediately. ""Oh good, how's everyone?"" It was Ava, calling from wherever the Waverider had currently landed.

""The kids were all asleep when I showed up,"" Sara answered, pulling the comforter higher around her. ""Ellie and Mia crashed waiting for me in the kitchen, actually. The cocoa will have to wait until morning.""

""Sounds like they wore themselves out with sisterly bonding,"" Ava commented. ""Why didn't you use your temporal watch to portal over there? That's the Legends' way of traveling, isn't it?""

Sara chuckled, setting her book down beside her. ""Well, that's the easy way. It had been a few years at least since I'd flown on a plane and then just drove a car. I was able to just sit and relax on the plane and then relax as I drove from the airport to the manor. No anomalies, no time quakes, just… traffic and bad airport coffee.""

She sighed, a sound of genuine peace. ""I needed the space, Ava. To decompress. To remember what it feels like to just be Sara who drives a rental car and not the Captain of the Waverider who teleports through the time stream. It was nice.""

""I totally get it,"" Ava agreed. ""So, you're officially on Earth-based mom duty for a few days?""

Sara settled deeper under the covers, the gold frames of her reading glasses glinting slightly under the lamp light. ""Yes, I'm mom for the week. Ellie's on her vacation break from her company, the other four don't work, so they’re always here. I have no idea what we'll do, but we'll figure it out. Probably a lot of takeout and maybe a trip to the gym, or the Batcave's equivalent of a gym.""

""Sounds… domestic. And slightly terrifying,"" Ava quipped. ""So, what are you doing now?""

""Reading a book,"" Sara answered simply.

Ava paused. ""Do you have your glasses on?""

A long, suffering sigh escaped Sara. She pinched the bridge of the gold-framed glasses. ""Yes, I do. I can't believe I'm going to be 41 in April, and I'm sitting here in a bed with reading glasses on and a book instead of, you know, fighting a giant anachronism with a grappling hook.""

Ava let out a hearty, loving chuckle on the other end of the line. ""Oh, honey. You are definitely a mom.""

""Don't sound so thrilled,"" Sara grumbled good-naturedly, though a warm feeling settled in her chest.

""I am thrilled,"" Ava insisted. ""It means you're safe, you're resting, and you're spoiling our daughter. That's a win for the timeline in my book. Now, get some sleep. And give those girls, and the puppies, a hug from me when they finally wake up.""

""Will do. Love you, Captain,"" Sara said.

""Love you more."" Ava said, then
Sara ended the call, placing the phone on the nightstand. 

She reached up and gently took off her reading glasses, setting them neatly on top of the book. The house was utterly silent again, save for the faint, distant sounds of the winter wind rattling the Manor's ancient windows. For the first time in a long time, Sara wasn't listening for the sound of a time alarm or a rogue temporal anomaly; she was simply listening to the quiet of her family's home. She turned off the lamp and settled in for a deep, well-deserved sleep.

The quiet peace of the guest room didn't last long past sunrise.
Sara was jerked from a deep, peaceful sleep not by an alarm, a temporal alert, or an assassin, but by a cold, wet nose bumping her cheek.
She groaned, shielding her face with an arm, only to have a second, fuzzier snout shove its way past her elbow. Two small balls of tiny fluff, Duke & Koda were perched precariously on the bed, their faces mere inches from hers. Their tails were wagging furiously, thumping against the comforter.

""Uggh, why?"" Sara groans, trying to burrow deeper into the pillows, shielding her face from the enthusiastic, puppy breath. She could feel a tiny, ticklish dog tongue attempting to lick her ear.
The sound of soft, muffled laughter came from the doorway.

Ellie and Mia stood there, already dressed in sweats and beaming mischievously. They were absolutely enjoying the show, watching the puppies jump and make playful noises, treating the bed like a canine trampoline and their chosen mom like a soft, human chew toy.

""They missed you, Mom,"" Ellie said, grinning.

""Or they smelled the lack of time travel and decided you were safe to attack,"" Mia offered, stepping into the room.

Sara dropped her arm, fixing both girls with a mock-glare. ""You two are enjoying this entirely too much."" She then gave in, scratching Duke behind his floppy ears and offering Koda a gentle head scratch.

""It's the traditional Wayne Manor welcome,"" Ellie insisted, walking over. ""Wake up, Captain. We have cocoa to drink.""

Sara pushes the puppies aside, sits up, and rubs her eyes, a tired but fond smile on her face.

""Alright, alright, I'm up,"" Sara said, pushing the dogs gently off the bed and stretching dramatically. She sat up, running a hand through her messy hair, her smile genuine despite the early wake-up call. ""You win. No time travel, no world-saving. I declare today a 'no missions, just movies and comfort food' day. Starting with those cookies and cocoa you two were trying to hoard.""

The next hour was spent in the Manor's cavernous, yet cozy, kitchen. The girls had their long-awaited hot cocoa and their fathers' special-occasion cookies, while Sara commandeered the stove to produce a legendary amount of pancakes, eggs, and bacon, a chaotic, but loving, breakfast that felt far removed from the sterile environment of the Waverider.

After the meal, the promise of a quiet day beckoned.
Sara, energized by the food and the quiet presence of her daughter, headed out to the pool. The snow was still falling lightly, but the Wayne Manor pool was always heated to a perfect, inviting temperature. She entered the indoor pool area in a striking white and gold bikini, a sharp contrast to the grey winter sky. She immediately plunged into the water, starting a steady, powerful rhythm of laps, working out the stiffness from the long flight and the lingering tension of her Captain duties.
She was mid-turn when she noticed another figure approaching the pool deck.

Tara, dressed in her, fluorescent orange bikini, walked with a slight hesitation before stopping at the edge. She didn't get in immediately, instead taking a moment to watch Ellie's mother. She observed the fluid power in Sara's strokes, the speed and grace of a trained assassin now translated into pure exercise.

Finishing her lap, Sara surfaced near the edge, pushing her wet hair back and offering Tara a welcoming smile.
""Hey, Tara. Looks like a good day for a swim,"" Sara said, her voice easy and relaxed.

Tara nodded, pushing her hands into the pockets of her coverup before letting it fall to the deck. ""It is. The heat feels good."" She stepped off the edge, sinking into the water up to her shoulders, letting the warmth envelop her.

The water was a neutral space, the perfect setting for their first one-on-one conversation. Tara respected Sara's status as a hero and as Ellie's chosen mother, but she'd never truly talked to her without the buffer of the other young heroes.

""You swim like you mean it,"" Tara noted, kicking gently to stay afloat.

""I do,"" Sara agreed, treading water. ""It's one of the few places I can move without worrying about breaking something... or someone. It clears my head. Keeps the bad old instincts on a leash."" She paused, her gaze softening. ""So, you holding up okay, kid?""

Tara tilted her head, letting the silence hang for a moment, the only sound the gentle lapping of the heated water. She looked past Sara, towards the glass walls of the Manor.

""It's nice here,"" Tara admitted. Then, she fixed her gaze on Sara, Tara admitted a curiosity about Sara's past: ""I know you're... the White Canary. A captain, a Legend, and before all that... an assassin.""

Sara’s expression didn't change, a testament to years of facing down impossible situations. ""That's a condensed version, but accurate.""

""I guess I was wondering,"" Tara continued, pushing her wet hair back, ""what was it like to transition from that deadly life... to this one? To just be Mom, reading a book with glasses on, and worrying about hot cocoa.""

Sara let out a soft, thoughtful exhale. The water, warm as it was, couldn't mask the deep weight of the question.
""It wasn't easy,"" Sara admitted, her voice low. ""For a long time, I thought the darkness was the only thing I was built for. That my only value was what I could destroy. But the Legends... they taught me that a person isn't defined by their worst day or their worst history. And then Ellie came into my life, and that was...""

She paused, looking out over the water, finding the right words.
""Ellie gave me a future that needed a protector, not a killer. And Ava gave me a partner who wasn't afraid of the shadows, but loved me into the light. The key, Tara, is finding the people who don't ask you to forget the deadly part of you, but show you how to control it, and use it only for good. That's what Bruce did for Ellie, and what Oliver did for Mia.""

Sara pushed off the side gently, gliding closer to Tara. ""It’s a choice you have to make every single day. The easiest thing to do is fall back into the darkness. The hardest, but best, choice is learning how to sit in the light and just... read a good book.""

""Ellie's a special ball of loving warmth,"" Tara said, a genuine smile replacing the tension in her expression. She shifted slightly, feeling more relaxed than she had all morning. ""I think Damian's right, she does have some sort of Meta-human ability to make things feel instantly alright.""

Sara let out a hearty laugh, pushing off the side and moving to sit on the edge of the pool, her legs dangling in the warm water next to Tara’s.
""Yeah, and then she convinces you to like Pokémon, right?"" Sara teased.

Tara laughed in response. ""Yes!"" she exclaimed, the simple admission making Sara laugh harder. ""She's gotten Kara, me, Rachel, and somehow even Damian to like it. We even had a team Pokémon night last month. Damian picked Umbreon.""

Sara shook her head, still chuckling. ""See? I knew it. She's using Bruce's bat-tactics to convince people to join her Pokémon fan club. It's a slow, meticulous infiltration of the emotional center of her friends. She distracts them with frills and glitter, then hits them with overwhelming cuteness and nostalgia.""

Sara pulled her feet up and rested her chin on her knees, watching Tara. ""She is the best thing that ever happened to me, and probably the best thing that ever happened to this entire generation of heroes. If she can get Damian Wayne to debate it, she can save the world.""

Tara nodded, completely serious now. ""She really can. And I'm glad she has you, Sara.""

""Me too, kid,"" Sara replied softly. ""Me too.""

Tara smiled, ""I think it’s funny and cute how Damian’s assassin mind was broken away by Ellie giving him hugs and saying 'I love you'. All those years of training by Ra's and Talia just completely ruined by Ellie's sister-love.""

Sara smiled. ""It's the ultimate soft power,"" she agreed. ""Every assassin is trained to withstand torture, interrogation, and psychological warfare. But no one trains them to withstand pure, unapologetic, unconditional love. That's Ellie's secret weapon, right there.""

She looked at Tara. ""It goes for all of you, actually. You all carry so much darkness and so many scars from the world your parents built. But when you guys get together and share Pokémon plushies and drama, you remind each other that the 'soldier' part of you isn't the whole story. You're just kids who love their family, even the ones you chose.""

Tara's smile softened, turning reflective. ""After being treated as a Super Soldier by my father and when I escaped to this side of the world, Ellie's first instinct was to hug me after just over a minute of meeting me... that was wonderful.""

Sara’s face tightened with shared empathy for the hidden trauma in Tara’s past. She reached out and placed a comforting hand on Tara's shoulder.

""She doesn't waste time on walls or defenses,"" Sara noted. ""She sees the person underneath all the history, the powers, and the expectations. That's why she's a light in this messed-up city, Tara. And that's exactly why you and Mia, and even Damian, are here. Because she gave you all permission to just... breathe. You're safe here, kid. You're home.""

As Sara and Tara shared their intimate moment of understanding, the peaceful scene was suddenly punctuated by a bright, cheerful voice.

""Look at these gorgeous angels!"" Ellie exclaimed brightly, walking onto the pool with Mia just a few steps behind her. Their entry brought a sudden infusion of energy and sunshine.

Ellie immediately rushed to the edge where Sara was sitting, dropping to her knees. ""Mom, you didn't tell me you were such a speed demon in the water!""

Mia grinned, slipping into the water near Tara. ""We saw the aftermath of the puppy attack. Duke and Koda are now sulking because the fun human with the good sleeping spots got away.""

Sara chuckled, genuinely amused by her daughter's boundless energy. ""They got a good few licks in before I realized my face was being used as a chew toy. Come on, you two. Join the water.""

Ellie, still kneeling, leaned in and gave Sara a quick, wet hug. ""Already on it!"" She then cannonballed into the water with a joyful splash, narrowly missing Mia and Tara, who both laughed.

Mia shook her head at Ellie's antics, but her eyes were full of sisterly affection. ""Well, if you're going to join us, we have to make sure we're not late for the comfort food part of the mission. Pizza and vintage cartoons are on the schedule, right?""

""Absolutely,"" Sara confirmed, standing up on the edge of the pool, water streaming off her white and gold suit. ""But first, tell me exactly which Pokémon we are starting our marathon with.""

Ellie beamed, her face radiating victory. ""Yes! I have my mom wanting to join the fan club, Ultimate Achievement unlocked!!!!!"" she cheered, throwing her arms up in triumph before executing a joyful jump backward.

Sara watched her daughter resurface, laughing openly. ""Okay, Cubbie, but my first question is: are there any characters with a better sense of style than me?""

Mia and Tara exchanged an amused look in the water. The simple, beautiful chaos of a super-family's well-deserved vacation day. The White Canary was officially indoctrinated.

Later that evening, the snow outside had settled into a thick, beautiful blanket, turning the Manor grounds into a silent, frosted landscape. Inside, the warmth was palpable.
Ellie’s room had been transformed into a cozy command center. The large bed was laden with blankets and pillows, and on the television, a classic Pokémon movie was just beginning. The four inhabitants were nestled in for the long haul.

The ladies were all back in their pajamas: Ellie in her bright purple and pink flannels, Mia in green and black, Tara in comfortable grey sweats, and Sara in her own soft sleepwear, now sporting a pair of thick, fuzzy socks.

Duke and Koda were sprawled lazily at the foot of the bed, occasionally twitching their ears at the sounds coming from the screen.
The main event, however, had just concluded: the selection of Sara’s official Pokémon team. Ellie had taken the task with the seriousness of a League strategist, finally settling on a list after several tactical adjustments.

Ellie triumphantly held up a small whiteboard with the final list. ""Okay, so after a few tweaks, this is the final, perfectly balanced, utterly devastating team for the White Canary, with zero redundant type weaknesses! 
We have: Lucario: for the martial arts genius. 

Tsareena: for the regal Captain authority that stops cheap shots.

Hisuian Zoroark: for stealth and the ghost of the past.

Johtoan Typhlosion: pure Fire power and controlled leadership.

Shiny Alolan Ninetales: the beautiful, ice-cold rarity.

Lastly, Garchomp: the unstoppable dragon-shark power.""


Sara looked at the list, genuinely impressed and running a hand along the gold frames of her glasses. ""That... that actually makes a terrifying amount of sense.""

Ellie beamed, settling back against the pillows. ""Mom, thanks for humoring us by doing this.""

Sara reached out and ruffled Ellie’s hair affectionately. ""Humoring you? Cubbie, I've always found it adorable how passionate you both have been about this series, it's cute seeing you two pick creatures that perfectly reflects my career""

Mia grabbed her Decidueye plushie and leaned closer to the screen. ""You'll probably love the Typhlosion. It's intense, but reliable. No nonsense.""

Tara, now clutching her Flygon plush, nodded. ""The whole team is perfectly chosen for the great Captain Lance.""
Sara just grinned, watching the screen, she was home.

While the three girls were happily debating the merits of the final team, totally absorbed in the world of animated monsters and elemental strategy, Sara had slipped her phone from the nightstand. She watched the happy, relaxed faces of Ellie, Mia, and Tara for a moment, a wave of profound contentment washing over her.

Then, a mischievous glint entered her eyes, with a quick, silent motion, Sara navigated her gallery. She found the picture she had taken earlier that day: a candid shot of herself in the pool, still dripping water, the white and gold bikini sharp against the grey winter backdrop. It was a picture that screamed both ""untouchable superhero"" and ""relaxed vacation.""

With a smirk that Ellie would instantly recognize as a precursor to trouble, she quickly attached the image to a message and sent it to her wife.

The caption was short, confident, and pure Sara:
“Hey, Captain. If you need something to relieve stress up there in space, here you go. 😉”

Sara slipped the phone back onto the nightstand, her smirk softening into a satisfied smile. She turned back to the girls, leaning back into the pillows, just as Ellie was explaining the difference between Dragon Pulse and Dragon Claw.  She knew she wouldn't have to wait long for Ava's inevitable, probably exasperated, but totally appreciative reply.

High above the timeline, tucked away in the temporal slipstream, Gideon was seated across the table from Ava. The Waverider kitchen was a picture of neat, polished calm, a sharp contrast to the chaotic nature of their work. They were quietly enjoying cups of herbal tea, discussing routine Time Bureau paperwork.

Suddenly, Ava’s personal phone that Gideon ensured always had the perfect signal regardless of the century, chimed with a distinct notification sound reserved only for Sara.

Ava picked it up, expecting a picture of the puppies or a complaint about Alfred’s laundry standards. The second the image loaded, her back stiffened, and her tea cup hovered halfway to her lips. She quickly brought the phone closer, trying desperately to keep her facial expression neutral, but a deep, shaky exhale escaped her.

""Good lord, Sara,"" Ava muttered, her voice a low, strangled whisper, A faint flush began to creep up her neck.

Gideon, ever observant, leaned slightly over the table with a knowing, gentle curiosity. She managed to catch a quick, detailed glimpse of the picture and the caption. 

Gideon straightened immediately, a subtle, almost-maternal smile on her face. ""Captain,"" she said, her voice perfectly calm and professional, ""If you like to take some time to return the favor, I can temporarily pilot the ship. The timeline is quite stable in this sector, and I am highly proficient at navigating boring centuries.""

Ava blinked, processing the offer, her mind still partially stuck on the image of her wife. ""Gideon, you can't just encourage this kind of... temporal instability.""

""On the contrary, Captain,"" Gideon replied smoothly, sipping her tea. ""I believe tending to the emotional stability of the senior Captain directly benefits the continuity of time itself. Please. The universe can wait a few minutes.""

Ava looked at the phone, then at the serene face of her ship's first mate. She sighed, a mixture of exasperation and pure, burning affection. ""Fine,"" Ava said, pushing her chair back with newfound resolve. ""But if a major anachronism pops up, I blame the German Shepherd.""

Back in the cozy, Pokémon-themed warmth of Ellie’s room, Sara's phone vibrated with a very specific, high-priority notification. She picked it up, expecting maybe a snarky GIF from her wife acknowledging the bikini picture. Instead, her eyes went wide, as Ava sent a photo of herself wearing a deceptively simple black bra and underwear. Her expression was fierce and composed.

The caption was a direct, devastating counter-strike:
“If you want something to think about.”

A huge, unrestrained smile bloomed across Sara’s face, followed by an immediate, almost frantic effort to cover her phone screen.
Ellie, observant and entirely unsurprised, took a long sip from her bottle of soda. She exchanged a knowing glance with Mia and Tara.

""Mom,"" Ellie said, her voice dripping with amusement, ""if you wanna go get some with Avabear, then go ahead.""

Sara nearly launched herself off the bed, her face flushing crimson. ""What!"" she sputtered, scrambling to find her composure, which was currently non-existent.

Mia, with suppressed laughter, nudged Ellie. ""We can see it on your face, whatever Ava sent you made you excited.""

""It's true, Sara,"" Tara added calmly, with a playful smirk. 

Ellie held up the bottle of soda in a mock toast. ""Yeah, it's your vacation too, we'll see ya when you're done.”

Sara looked at the three smug younger women, then back at her phone, admitting total defeat.

""I hate all of you,"" Sara declared, though the fierce joy in her eyes betrayed the sentiment. ""Don't touch the pizza.""

And with that, she was out the door and running towards the nearest temporal access point to deal with the greatest time anomaly of all: a very motivated wife.

An hour later Sara and Ava were under the covers in their bedroom on the Waverider, they were both breathing heavily after their very successful, if slightly abrupt, ""Captains Meeting.""

Ava smirked, rested her head on Sara's shoulder. ""So I take it I won?""

Sara looked over, running a hand through her messy hair. ""That wasn't a win.""

""I got you to portal over, didn't I?"" Ava challenged, a playful triumph in her voice.

""Shut it,"" Sara grumbled, making Ava laugh lightly and press a kiss to her cheek.

Ava watched Sara sit up and start to change back into her pajamas. ""So what've you been doing over there?""

Sara, as she pulled her shirt back on, sighed contentedly. ""Well, I took a dip in the pool with Ellie, Tara, and Mia. Then, after getting back into comfy clothes, I had been having a conversation with our daughter and our niece about their favorite thing.""

Ava raised an eyebrow, already guessing. ""They recruited you, didn't they?""

Sara sat back on the bed, leaning against the headboard. ""I'm not recruited like how Kara, Damian, and Rachel are. I just let Ellie and Mia make me a team of those little creatures they thought fit me. I'm not going to be a fanatic.""

Ava chuckled, pulling the blanket higher. ""I can handle our daughter's fanaticism, but not both of you.""

Sara put a hand on Ava's shoulder, her tone instantly softening. ""Don't worry, you won't. Also, Ellie called you Avabear before I portaled over here.""

Ava sat up curiously. ""Avabear?""

Sara smiled warmly. ""It's your name and Mama Bear combined. I guess it’s Ellie’s way of also calling you 'mom' without confusion.""

Ava’s face melted away into raw parental affection. ""Avabear,"" she repeated softly. ""I like that very much.""

Sara leaned in, capturing Ava's lips in a soft, prolonged kiss. ""Now that our Captains Meeting is over, I have a Pokémon team to brag about.""

Sara reappeared in the large, gothic guest room of the Manor with a soft 'whoosh' of displaced air from the teleportation, Ellie, Mia, and Tara hadn't moved far. The large pizza box was open, and the first few slices had been claimed, but the girls were still lounging, focused on the movie and their conversation.

Mia, taking a small bite of pizza, looked up at her Aunt Sara's radiant expression. ""Did you have fun?""

Sara grinned, walking over to the bed and settling back down amidst the pillows and the still-snoozing puppies. ""It was an exceedingly entertaining Captain's Meeting. Highly productive.""

Ellie, however, was already on to the next mission. She reached under a pillow and produced a small piece of folded paper, handing it to Sara with a flourish.

""Welcome back, Mom! Here,"" Ellie said. ""This is Avabear's team.""

Sara unfolded the paper, her eyes quickly scanning the six names written in Ellie’s neat, purple handwriting: Primarina, Absol, Hisuian Goodra, Glaceon, Gallade, and Talonflame.

Sara looked up at the other three, a fond, amused look on her face. ""You're having fun giving us older adults teams, aren't you?""

Ellie gave a theatrical, unapologetic smirk. ""Obviously. I know you and the other older adults are mainly annoyed by our fanaticism over it. But it’s not really meant to recruit you all, it’s just a fun thought. A way to show who you guys are through Pokémon, you know?""

Sara chuckled, pulling Ellie into a hug. ""It's a very fun thought, Cubbie. Did you give Ava a special theme?""

""Precision and Defense,"" Mia piped up immediately. ""She's basically unstoppable.""

Sara sighed happily, resting back against the pillows, the paper clutched in her hand. ""Unstoppable, and currently wearing black lace on the bridge of a time machine.""

""Pizza?"" Tara offered, pushing the box toward Sara.

""Absolutely,"" Sara replied.

In the quieter wing of the Manor, Damian and Rachel were enjoying their own version of a peaceful afternoon. They were both sitting up in Damian's large bed, surrounded by dark, minimalist sheets, each engrossed in a book.

Rachel lowered her book with a faint smile. ""It's nice to spend a day away from the wild ones.

Damian didn't look up but his response was immediate and dry. ""Agreed. Ellie and Mia are two balls of chaotic energy attempting to convert this house into a glitter-infused circus.""

""But they're happy chaos,"" Rachel mused, turning a page. ""And they did give us the quiet we asked for... eventually.""

""A conditional surrender,"" Damian corrected. ""I suspect they are merely planning their next saturation attack.""

Damian's suspicion was absolutely correct. Down the hall, in Ellie's room, Mia was in the midst of a meticulous, highly detailed strategic planning session, this time, targeting the Flash and the resident science genius.

Mia had a piece of paper and a pen.
""When it comes to Barry's team,"" Mia announced, tapping the paper. ""We start with Cinderace because he's red and its name perfectly fits the whole running/kicking thing. That's non-negotiable.""

""Check,"" Ellie said, crossing her legs on the bed.

""Next, Boltund because he's Electric, fits with Barry's powers, and Barry does have that Golden Retriever energy, honestly."" said Mia.

""Totally,"" Ellie agreed, nodding enthusiastically.

Mia continues, ""Then, Dragonite because it's a cute dragon that fits with Barry's overwhelmingly kind personality, much like Kara's. For his fourth member, Scizor because it's red and fast, pure speed synergy. Number five is Ludicolo because he's goofy and loves to dance, just like Barry at a post-mission celebration. Lastly, number six for Barry, is Rampardos because he can go back in time to the dinosaurs if he wants to.""

""Okay, next is Caitlin."" Ellie sat up, adopting her 'scientific' voice. ""Going to the 'Scientist Team.' To start, I think Mamoswine, which fits Caity's powers, and because of it being a huge, icy mammoth.""

""Strong start,"" Mia acknowledged, scribbling.

""Next, Altaria, because it's a fluffy cloud dragon. I think it also fits being with a scientist, a kind, gentle aesthetic that counterbalances the cold. Then Stoutland. I think it makes sense for Caity to have one of the Pokedogs, and Stoutland gives off that 'Best Boy' loyal, reliable energy.""
Ellie moved on, counting on her fingers. ""Number four is Hisuian Lilligant to also fit with Caity's elegance and grace. Number five is Espeon, an intelligent Psychic mon that evolves through pure friendship, reflecting her deep bonds with Team Flash. And lastly, number six, her starter: Inteleon, which as its name says, continues going along with Caity's intelligence and precision as a forensic scientist.""

Mia finished writing, putting the pen down with a satisfied tap. ""Whose should we blow next?""

The girls quickly devoured the pizza slices and turned their formidable creative energy toward the next batch of heroes. 

Mia tapped her pen against the whiteboard. ""Okay, Clark is next, so big, powerful, heroic, but also kind and heart. I think Blaziken & Beartic for brute strength and the fortress-of-solitude feel.

Staraptor: a reliable flyer who never gives up.

Ampharos: the literal shining lighthouse of hope.

Azumarill: the powerful but unassuming symbol of his wholesome farm-boy energy.

And Ferrothorn: The unbreakable defense, reflects his invulnerability.""

Ellie took the lead on the next hero, tapping her chin thoughtfully. ""Okay, next is Dick. Hmm... needs to reflect his agility, his time as Robin, and his big-brother energy. I think... 

Feraligatr: A strong, cool, fierce starter.

Corviknight: The dark, reliable, flying shadow of Gotham, great defense. 

Kommo-o: A.powerful, balanced fighter with a sense of honor, for his leadership. 

Leafeon: For his bright, kind, nature-loving personality.

Electivire: For Raw power and energy, reflecting his vibrant acrobatics.

And Wigglytuff: For the soft, supportive, big-brother Pokémon.""

Mia then launched into the final hero on their current list: Starfire.
""Then for Kori. She needs a team that screams royalty, beauty, and massive energy. 

First Meganium: beautiful, graceful, healing aura.

Togekiss: A beautiful, joyful flyer that spreads happiness.

Flareon: Intense, concentrated fire power.

Lopunny: Elegance and grace, reflecting her beauty and agility.

Female Jellicent: Unique alien beauty, and also surprisingly powerful and regal.

and Kalosian Goodra: A gentle, kind, yet overwhelmingly powerful dragon.""

Ellie reached for the notebook, her eyes sparkling. ""Perfect."".

Tara, who had been quietly watching the whole process, just smiled.

The ransom note was written inside the house. 29 years later, her killer has never been found.","On Christmas night, 6-year-old JonBenét Ramsey was murdered in her family’s home. The ransom note was written inside the house. 29 years later, her killer has never been found. - A 2½-page ransom note, opening with “Listen carefully!” and ending “Victory! S.B.T.C.”, was discovered just before 6:00 a.m. on December 26, 1996. It was handwritten on paper from inside the house, using a family pen, and demanded exactly $118,000. The same amount as John Ramsey’s recent work bonus. Investigators quickly noticed how strange that was: in real ransom cases, amounts are usually round figures, not oddly specific sums known only to a handful of people.

What followed was chaos. Police treated it as a kidnapping instead of a homicide. Neighbors and clergy were invited inside. Coffee was poured. Evidence was moved. Hours passed before anyone searched the entire house. At about 1:00 p.m., John Ramsey and a family friend went to the basement and found JonBenét in a small, windowless “wine cellar.” She was wrapped in a white blanket, duct tape across her mouth, and a nylon cord around her neck tied with the broken handle of Patsy Ramsey’s paintbrush. The autopsy ruled the cause of death as asphyxia by strangulation associated with craniocerebral trauma. A fatal combination of head injury and strangulation, but which came first has never been determined.

In the kitchen, police found a bowl of pineapple and milk; the same fruit was partially digested in JonBenét’s stomach. A Hi-Tec boot print was discovered near her body that didn’t match anyone in the family. A palm print on the basement door remains unidentified. The broken basement window that some believe the intruder used was explained by John Ramsey. He said he broke it himself weeks earlier after locking himself out. The well-known claim about undisturbed snow around the window, often cited as proof no one entered or exited, has been disputed by later investigators.

Partial male DNA was detected on JonBenét’s underwear and leggings. It didn’t match any family member, but the sample was extremely small, partially mixed, and vulnerable to contamination. Handwriting analysis excluded John Ramsey, couldn’t conclusively exclude Patsy, and ultimately remained inconclusive. In 1999, a grand jury reportedly voted to indict the Ramseys for child abuse resulting in death, but the district attorney declined to prosecute, citing insufficient evidence. In 2008, the family was publicly cleared based on touch DNA testing, though later experts questioned the strength of that finding.

What remains is a case that collapses under its own contradictions. The “Ramsey Did It” theory fits the note and the household evidence but lacks any clear forensic link. The “Intruder” theory fits the unidentified DNA and boot print but suffers from the absence of a credible entry point. Both rely on facts blurred by contamination and early investigative mistakes. The first 24 hours doomed the case: the crime scene wasn’t secured, the body was moved, and the evidence chain fractured beyond repair.

Nearly three decades later, Boulder PD claims to be working with outside labs to apply modern DNA and forensic genealogy. The hope is that one of those minutes, aging samples: the cord, the garrote, or the clothing might still hold a trace that technology can unlock. But optimism has often outpaced reality.

**Questions for the thread:** If you could run one modern test on one remaining piece of evidence, what would it be? The garrote? The ligatures? Her clothing? Does the $118,000 demand point to insider knowledge or deliberate misdirection? And if you could change just one thing from that morning: locking down the house, conducting a full search, or controlling the media what do you think would have changed this case the most?",5,1762565127.0,crime,0,0.86,False

I'll get the K story out of the way.  I care less about him, but it is relevant.  A couple of years ago, I visited him on his birthday to give him a card and gift.  His housemate (G) let me in, but K couldn't be bothered to come down from his room for at least an hour.  When he did, he was incredibly rude.  This was the beginning of the end of that friendship.  I have barely been back to that house since that day.



After that, K dodged calls and retreated into his bedroom.  He wouldn't respond to messages, so I kind of dropped it.  He was so rude I still haven't forgiven him for that day - but maybe it was my fault for intruding on his birthday.  That pales in comparison to what came next anyway.



K decided to get into tiktok.  Mainly waggling sock puppets to audio clips comedians have made.  He met a woman on tiktok, half his age.  They met and she is now expecting his baby.  He is 48, she is 25.  She also has 4 kids she is not allowed to see unsupervised.  This is just context.



I hadn't spoken to or heard from K in a while, when I started getting accusations of stalking and horrible text messages?  I blocked him, but the accusations apparently continued (according to a mutual friend).  Not my problem anymore.



Now, onto my stranger thing.  G.  He was a bit blindsided by K's actions, and not knowing when he would be in the house or 200 miles away at his tiktok womans place for months.  K would never say anything to anyone, he would just vanish for months and then reappear for a few weeks.



A couple of weeks ago, G asked to come to my house to talk.  Fine, nothing unusual there.  When he walked in, he said he ""didn't know what was happening"" and basically burst into tears.  I hugged him.



As the evening went on, he told me he was feeling paranoid.  I asked why?  He didn't really elaborate.  Just that he felt weird, and he didn't know what K was up to.  He did ask me ""what the plan was"", which in retrospect, was a big red flag.



Here's where it gets weird.



G invited me to his house a few days later, I said I'd pop by after work.  We spoke for about an hour quite reasonably and normally, like the old friends we were.



Then something quite suddenly changed.  He marched over to the front door (the only entry/exit) and locked it and put the key in his pocket.  He then demanded to know ""how long has this been going on for, who's involved and why?""  I was puzzled.



Apparently, I have been planting surveillance devices around their house and in his bedroom.  I have been orchestrating various people (who I don't know) to spy on him.  That everything I've said over the last few years is me ""laying breadcrumbs"", and that I'm an actor - but not a very good one.  He could see right through me.  He just needed to know why I was going to ""ruin his life?"" 



He was convinced a website was going to go live with all sorts of bad things I'd recorded him doing (I do not know what these bad things are).  



Any attempt to talk him down seemed like further proof to him?  So, I'm locked in his house at this point.  He then looms over me (I'm sitting down on a sofa) and I felt compelled to say ""Do not use violence on me, G.""  He sat down on the sofa opposite.



He's trying to piece all these things together.  He keeps accusing me and getting himself more and more wound up.  



I say ""I'm feeling pretty uncomfortable, I'd like to leave.""  He says I'd have to call the police for that.  I advise against, as he had a big pile of weed on the coffee table.  



He insists I call 999.  So I do.  The operator asks to go on speaker, which I do.  G then starts ranting about how we're all in on it, we're recording him, talking about FM transmitters and such.  The operator persuades him to let me leave to which he says ""I will reluctantly let him go"".  But asks the emergency operator to confirm it's all being recorded (ironic) in case we do ""ruin his life"".  I leave.



We had a couple of calls and texts after that, but he still thinks I'm ""in on it"" so I just blocked him.  I didn't think I could say anything that wouldn't get twisted to my previously trusted friend of 20+ years.



So - what do?  I don't give a fuck about K, he's made bad decisions and those will come up for him lately and he won't have my support.



G though.  Hmm.  I've never seen him like that.



Have I lost two friends to a folie a deux?  Should I ever speak to G again?  He did basically imprison me temporarily and I did fear for my safety.



This is a few weeks on and I'm still racking my brain.  I'm just so puzzled.

Very few sensors work. Etc...

You hit hyperspace and the. As far as you know, no time passes, because when you drop back into real space, you are unpaused. No harm, no radiation, nothing. It's to the point that a few species learned to use static hyperspace tubes as essentially stasis chambers.

When humans arrived they had mulriple FTL methods. Every species had at least two, including hyperspace jumps. Humans had more than most, but a hyperspace jump was still the fastest. The rest were noting new. A novel approach here, a bit better or worse there. Nothing of note. Though oddly, though their hyperspace jump drives were quite literally nothing special, primitive even. Human ships were not just faster, with less calulation time and a fraction of the calculation precison. Human ships were factors of magnitude faster. 

A 3 week trip by the best drive of the most advanced species. Humans did it in 3 hours. Worse, as long as it was a human at the helm for the jump, ANY ship could do it.

The thing was, people started to notice oddities. Was that cup of coffee there before the jump? I thought they were sitting facing a different direction. 

The worst. Dropping out of Jump and the human wasn't on the bridge, appologizing about needing to use the bathroom as they strolled back in. Something about drinking too much the night before.

Turns out. Hyperspace doesn't pause humans. They're able to see, and navigate hyperspace, thus their shorter trip times. Human's. They noticed other species seemingly frozen and didn't think on it.",50,1762565068.0,humansarespaceorcs,3,0.98,False

1orca09,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeAndEspressoGear/comments/1orca09/the_ultimate_beginners_guide_to_coffee_espresso/,☕ The Ultimate Beginner’s Guide to Coffee & Espresso Gear,"

If you’ve ever tasted a perfect espresso or pour-over and wondered *“How do I make this at home?”* — you’re not alone.  
Coffee brewing has evolved far beyond simple drip machines. Whether you’re a casual coffee drinker or an aspiring home barista, choosing the right **coffee and espresso gear** is the first step toward a better cup.



# 🏠 1. Start With the Right Grinder

A good grinder is **more important than the machine**. Burr grinders produce even grounds that extract flavor consistently.

* **Manual burr grinders**: great for travel and small budgets (e.g., Timemore, 1Zpresso).
* **Electric burr grinders**: best for home espresso or pour-over setups (e.g., Baratza, Fellow Ode).

https://preview.redd.it/p5y7thvuoxzf1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=420dcf9ae5bdda4726f63907f6c839b07f6d0a5f

  
☕ 2. Choosing Your Coffee Machine

There’s no single “best” machine — it depends on how you like your coffee.

**Espresso machines**

* Entry-level: De’Longhi Dedica, Breville Bambino
* Mid-range: Gaggia Classic Pro, Rancilio Silvia
* Premium: Lelit Bianca, Profitec Pro 600

**Alternative brewers**

* French Press (full-bodied and simple)
* AeroPress (quick, travel-friendly)
* Pour-over (clean flavor; Hario V60 or Chemex)

# 🌡️ 3. Essential Accessories You’ll Love

Small tools make a big difference:

* Digital scale (for precise ratios)
* Temperature-controlled kettle
* Espresso tamper or WDT tool
* Knock box for easy cleanup
* Milk frother or steam wand

https://preview.redd.it/rsnt57gapxzf1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=328e48655849f3b52701c254cfa0b47c1db2c2dd

# 🌍 4. Buy Fresh, Quality Beans

Even the best gear can’t fix old or low-quality beans.  
Look for **freshly roasted beans** (roasted within the last 2–3 weeks) and experiment with local roasters.  
Try single-origin for clarity of flavor or blends for balance.

1orc55m,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1orc55m/mil_will_be_homeless_if_we_dont_move_in_with_her/,MIL will be homeless if we don't move in with her but I think it's a terrible idea.,"My MIL  (late 40s) is disabled and lives alone. She has a caregiver that is flakey at best and no husband. She receives SSDI and a housing voucher. The housing voucher will expire at the end of her lease in August and she will be homeless if my (28F) wife (29MTF) do and I not move in and take over her lease because she cannot afford housing on her disability income. She has many disabilities including heart failure and needs to have heart surgery this year or ""her heart will be in critical condition.""


Context: my wife was treated like her mom's spouse and servant  as a child. My wife lived with her mom and grandmother. She was expected from a very young age to do all household chores as well as assist with personal care needs of her mom and grandma. That meant my wife did all cleaning in the house and did things like prepare coffee, bring the remote, take off shoes, basically whatever her mom or grandma didn't want to do, she was made to do. Even having to clean up a heavily soiled toilet from her mom's cycle whenever she was on it. She was also her mom's emotional support because her mom was single.

My wife's grandma was the breadwinner while her mom did not work, she did provide the meals. Her mom and grandma were the extent of her family. They were very mean to her growing up. They tore her down, did not allow her to have friends, and were controlling. They held material things over her head, constantly accused her of lying, and her mom treated her like a spouse she didn't have.  My wife didn't have internet access or a cellphone until after she turned 18.  Her grandma passed away about 8 years ago and my MIL turned the entire household responsibility onto my wife. My wife could not handle it and left. They did not speak for 7 years due to the mistreatment she experienced and her mom's refusal to acknowledge where she went wrong as a mother. My wife and I have been together for six years and met shortly after her grandma passed. I was there when she moved out of her mom's. Both my wife's mom and grandma were narcissists.

My father was very ill last year. This prompted us to reach out to my wife's mother, as my wife does not have any other family and was thinking about her. The reunion was great. Her mom was very warm and excited to have her around. Initially I didn't see any of the behaviors that my wife described but over time, they came out. Mil is very friendly and warm to me, does not demand things, and always tells me I'm her daughter now.  She was even very receptive of my wife coming out as mtf trans to her.

Mil has a caregiver through the state who is flakey at best and she needs another. I admittedly was talked into enrolling as a caregiver to be paid by the state to help take care of her, she framed it as a good way for my wife and I to make more money because ""she doesn't need much help."" This has obviously shifted. At first she didn't need much help, then she needed someone to come see her every morning. That was a big thing, she *needed* all this help first thing in the morning but what she really wanted was for someone to bring her coffee and ice to chew on. Now she says she needs someone there all the time so she can fire her caregiver.  She claims she can't cook for herself, clean, etc but when I come in the evening to help her, she declines my help and says she'll do it. If my wife is there, she has no problem asking for thing after thing. She says she can't care for herself at all but I know her other caregiver does not cook at all and mil  has these big complicated meals made from the night before if I come in the morning.  She often exaggerates and stretches the truth to get what she wants. ""The cat has no food and I need some now so I can feed him dinner!"" But I go and she has a half full bag of food. She claims she needs coffee asap or creamer because she's out. We go, she does have some but not none like she claimed. She says her Dr apt is at 10am and we need to be there two hours early. We get there, she's not wanting to get ready, and the appointment wasn't til 12. She constantly stretches the truth or outright lies.

The behaviors towards my wife have begun again. I see the signs. Her demanding things from my wife, telling my wife she needs to do something vs asking. I was in the restroom at mil's house one day and she did not know I was there yet.  I overheard mil laying into my wife and guilt tripping the shit out of her because my wife told her we didn't have the money to buy her a carton of cigarettes. When I came into the room, mil immediately calmed down and became very sweet. 

Well, the program that pays for her housing ends in August. We knew that *one day* we may have to move in to help her. We have seen no paperwork that confirms it's ending, just her word after a weird phone call she got. ""Oh it's ending in August so you'll have to come and take over my lease!"" My wife told her we'd figure it out but did not say yes. Now my MIL is trying to get her surgery scheduled before our current lease at our apartment ends (February) so we will be forced to move in then instead of August. She did not ask if we were okay with this. She just decided it's how things would be done. This is the same woman who will burst into tears about how she ""hates asking for things."" So her solution is to not ask. She demands. She just does things without asking because she hates being told no.

My wife told her without me there today, that we would not be moving in February and it was a shit show. MIL immediately blamed me for having cold feet and not wanting to move. Then she framed it as not blaming me but rather, showing concern because she knows I do get cold feet sometimes. I really really did not appreciate this. She refused to take any accountability for past actions when my wife was a child. I spoke to her and my wife on the phone where I was very clear with my concerns. I said that I was concerned with the behavior towards my wife and that it was inappropriate for her to be treated like her mom's spouse as a child and I would not live with someone who treats my spouse like their own. I said, from everything (wife) has told me and the behaviors I've seen, I'm concerned that the dynamic you had with her when she was a child will come back and thats unacceptable. Living with you and helping you is one thing but we need our own space and (wife) cannot just run to your every call like when she was a kid. She did not acknowledge how her past behavior was wrong at all and made excuses. I pointed out how I heard her yelling at my wife and guilt tripping her. Mil denied that happened. She also insisted that the reason she treated my wife the way she did was because it was a ""family dynamic"" where someone in the house was sick (her grandma at the time) so yes, her child did have to do a lot but us moving in would be different...because of me being her caretaker and that is different than a family dynamic. Then I had to get off the phone for work. 

Mil ended up bawling her eyes out to my wife about ""how hard it was to open back up to her after everything that happened."" And ""I thought you would've grown more since before."" ""I don't see you as my spouse I see you as my child and friend."" MIL believes my wife was 100% wrong in moving out and that she was an incredible mom who did not a single thing wrong. She blames my wife for losing her house before and having to live with someone abusive after
 She's never taken an ounce of accountability for anything she's done and continues to be very entitled and demanding. She inserts her opinions as facts and tells us what to do. You NEED to go vote for this. You NEED to call off of work for no kings day. You NEED to do XYZ. The one that made be the angriest is she told us my ""(wife) needed to stop wearing dresses and dressing like a girl because it's too dangerous right now."" 

I think it's a BAD idea to move in with her. She can't even have a conversation about boundaries without a blow up. My wife is struggling because she does not want to live with her but doesn't want her mom to be homeless and feels like it's morally wrong to let her mom lose housing and become homeless.  I don't want to live with my MIL because I'm certain it'll destroy my wife's mental health and the life we've worked SO HARD for. This might be wrong but we decided not to have children together because we didn't want to take care of someone. MIL constantly says she's is like a child who needs parents to care for her and it's ""her turn to be the kid and our turn to be the parent.""  I really don't feel comfortable moving in with someone who needs to be cared for like that. I did not sign up to be someone's care taker for the next who knows how long. I signed up to cook for her, feed her cat, and clean up when needed. I signed up to supplement where her current caregiver falls short. I was told one thing at the beginning and now she wants the world. She told my wife, ""I don't need much and you don't need to sit in my room. Id prefer you wait in the other room and live your life til I need to be cared for."" She wants us to sit around and wait for her to need something. All day. Every day.


If we move in, we are effectively trapped til she dies. She will be totally reliant on us and make it so if we leave her, she'll be screwed. I think she is deliberately trying to set it up that way so she can guilt her child into taking care of her. 

The idea of my wife going through this with her mom makes me feel sick. The idea of trying to have a life, intimacy, anything, and hearing my MIL interrupting as she shrieks for my wife makes me physically ill. I understand morally it's wrong to leave her homeless but what about our lives? Mil refuses to meet in the middle or respect boundaries so we would have to live there on her terms.

This isn't even everything. She hosted our wedding in her backyard (we were married at the courthouse a month prior.). It was very weird because she set up her own dream wedding she didn't get to have and took basically none of our input on what we wanted. She even made my wife wear the wedding dress she saved for over twenty years and didn't get to wear.

Please give me input, I have no idea what to do. My Mil wants an answer on if we are moving in August and we didn't give her one yet.",3,1762564342.0,JUSTNOMIL,27,0.64,False
1orc518,https://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/1orc518/70_developers_from_ak_master_list_of_the_best/,(70+ developers from A~K) Master list of the best MADs showcasing developers and their visual novels available in English [November 2025][tag:AMV] PART1/3,"Hello, we once posted here many years ago, and we are now going to post an updated list. This will be an appreciation thread for high-level edited MADs, most being MADs that were involved in video editing competitions. MADs that use visual novels as source material don’t get much attention, that is why we decided to put together a list of highly recommended MADs for visual novel fans. These MADs can both help you relive the emotions of visual novels you’ve already completed, or lowkey get you into picking up new visual novels for your backlog.

TL;DR this list is to raise prestige for MAD editors, but also a roundabout scheme to promote many visual novels and flagships from many different developers with developers as the focus.

I hope people thoroughly enjoys the list.

PART 2/3 (link will be here, post in a few days)

PART 3/3 (link will be here, post in a few days after PART 2)

*Note 1*: Most links are shared on YouTube by the *maplexman* team from bilibili, nicovideo, and other web portals of editing competitions.

*Note 2*: Visual novels that are tagged \[English\] are considered available or to-be-released in English. All visual novel titles are ordered by oldest release date from the top under their respective developers/brands.

*Note 3*: A few review videos from [Amelie Doree](https://www.youtube.com/c/ameliedoree) and [August Hail](https://www.youtube.com/@TheAugustHail) were slipped into the list. If you catch sight of their name, try to hear them out in their analysis videos to see if they get you interested in particular visual novels.

*Note 4*: MADs that use untranslated visual novels are listed at the bottom of the list under the “**UNTRANSLATED**” heading (in PART 3).

*Note 5*: If there are any broken links or misplaced information, let me know. I’ll continuously update the post whenever needed.

After the dance, we exchanged socials and I got a text from him two days later asking if he could take me out on a date, I agreed and the next day he picked me up and we went to a coffee shop and got to know each other. Now fast forward 2 years later, we’re now 22F and 21M and we’ve been in this on and off relationship, whenever we get into disagreements or when things get too hard he would break up with me and then reach out the next day apologizing and asking me to take him back. He would tell me he’s going to do better and try harder . In those two years we’ve gone through so much together and we’ve helped each other through some tough times. He was right by my side when I got diagnosed with MS and was constantly in the hospital. He was also there for me when I going through major depression. I could tell that sometimes it gets too much for him to deal with. Yesterday he broke with me and I think this might be the end because I don’t think i can take him back. This relationship isn’t good for us even if we love each other. We ending things on a good note with a lot of tears and had a deep conversation for a hour +,we said our last I love yous and goodbyes.

This would be in 2027 so it is still a ways out but I’m a stress planner! We make around a combined income of 100k and are looking to rent preferably a townhome but apartment would be doable as well. 
Currently we are in west Texas. I’ve lived in west Texas my entire life and I’m craving a change of scenery. It’s very flat, brown, no trees, windy and dusty. I just want trees and greenery when I look out the window!!! 
How is the weather? Are there seasons? We don’t know what seasons are in west Texas haha. 
We are homebodies but huge nerds. We love anime and comic cons, comic book stores, coffee shops and going shopping but are easily overwhelmed by overly crowded places which is why we try to avoid large cities. Our current city’s population is around 250k and would like to stay below that or near it.
My boyfriend travels for work so he is able to live anywhere as long as he has access to a decent airport. 
We are looking for somewhere relatively liberal. I know Missouri is a red state but we would prefer a more blue city. 
How have y’all’s experiences been in Columbia? Do you recommend? What are some of the safest areas to live? With my partner traveling for work, I am often home alone and would like to feel safe!
