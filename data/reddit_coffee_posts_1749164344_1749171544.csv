1l4fmqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mediums/comments/1l4fmqz/a_woman_told_me_she_was_a_medium_and_that_she_had/,A woman told me she was a medium and that she had messages for me,"I was getting coffee this morning and this woman I have never seen before walked up to me and told me she was a medium, that she was here to deliver messages from the spirit.
 
She said she had a message for me so I allowed her to share it with me.
Anyways this was her message to me and it shocked me. 

""You keep spending your time on the wrong things, but it no longer feeds your soul, but you keep coming back. It's time to let go now and move on.""

""You need to learn to love yourself unconditionally. The reason why you are unhappy is because you need to love yourself fully. Once you learn how to do that then love will overflow from you into others."" 

""Your soulmate will return in two months."" 

""You will get an internship in the creative arts and that will fulfill your spirit and soul."" 

And then she just casually walked away. 

Each message did align with what I'm going through currently in my life. I definitely need to learn self love, acceptance and forgiveness.

I definitely need to let go of some people, places and things. I definitely need to grow and move forward with love. 

I definitely need to do something in the creative arts because I have many artistic talents that I havent nurtured and it is a huge piece of who I am that I have neglected. 

The soulmate one I'm not sure about.

Other than that, I am bewildered about this.

UPDATE: Huge thanks to Regina for the air fryer, lamp, and rugs! Chicken nuggets used to take a 45-minute commitment — now, thanks to Regina, they’re ready in just seven!

Update 2: With help from my neighbor Barbara, I now have a couch.

Update 3: Thanks to Jinnie Martinusen, we now have a much more stylish duvet, more pillows, the ability to drink from proper cups, cut up produce with ease, and enjoy it all under the improved ambience of our new light fixture

Update 4: Thanks to Sergio, we now have a place to store our socks and pants instead of hanging them—a tedious process. Plus, the TV is now at a much more comfortable viewing height

Update 5 : Thank you to Christina Marie and her husband for the Old Spice body wash and deodorant, and for the red coffee maker. Thanks to their thoughtful contributions, we’ll be fresh and energized in the mornings!

Update 6: Thanks to a second generous gift from Regina, we now have a rugged, heavy-duty trash receptacle and a new side table for our bed.

UPDATE 7: Big thanks to my friend Wes at the chiropractor’s office on Riverside and Florin! Thanks to him, I was finally able to pick up the chairs Julie was kind enough to have her husband set out for me—despite my chaotic scheduling and less-than-stellar logistics this week. I’d been unintentionally putting Julie Charis off, and although I couldn’t be there in person, Wes (who’s not only great with spinal alignment but also a true friend) went out of his way to pick up the chairs and bring them to me.

I’ll post a picture once they’re in my house, but in the meantime—huge thanks to Julie, and my apologies again for the delay

Update 8: Thanks to my friend Garry from River’s Edge, I now have two leather recliners in my living room—bringing not only a new level of sophistication, but also a comfort that far exceeds the previous setup.

Update 9: Big thanks to Lacey for the awesome closet inserts and area rugs—my floors desperately needed the style boost! The living room and bedroom feel so much cozier now, and the rugs even match the decor gifted by the wonderful people mentioned in earlier updates.

Also, shoutout for the much-needed cleaning supplies—thank you again, Lacey! Truly appreciated.

Update: 10 : Huge thanks to Lucy for all the amazing goodies — food for both me and Loki, much-needed sheets and towels, a coffee table for my living room, and even a mirror and candles for my room. Seriously, shoutout to Lucy for coming through in such a big way

UPdATE 11: A huge thank you to Verna for the shelf—it’s already up and in place over the toilet, and it’s made a big difference! It was quick to assemble and has really helped maximize the storage space in a spot that was otherwise going unused. Super efficient and very much appreciated!

Also, an extra thank you for the toiletries. Thanks to you, I can keep up with being clean-shaven, and let me just say—using the new razor for the first time felt like switching from a rusty old blade to a lightsaber. The difference was incredible!

And thank you, Velma, for thinking of me and helping with all of this. Your kindness doesn’t go unnoticed. Truly grateful to have such thoughtful people around

UpdaTE 12: Update: Jinnie Martinusen Thank you so much for the couch—it’s perfect! It even matches the existing color scheme, which was a pleasant surprise. It fits right in and has already made the space feel a lot more cozy and complete. I really appreciate your generosity and

# QR Codes: From Car Parts to Your Coffee Order

**QR codes were invented for tracking car parts, not marketing campaigns**. Toyota needed a faster way to scan parts on assembly lines in 1994. Now they're everywhere from restaurant menus to crypto wallets.

Your phone scans those little squares millions of times faster than the barcode scanners they replaced. **Denso Wave** created QR codes because regular barcodes couldn't hold enough data for complex automotive manufacturing.

 

# The Story Behind It

**Masahiro Hara** was frustrated watching factory workers manually input part numbers. Barcodes maxed out at 20 characters. His team needed something that could store 4,000+ characters and scan instantly from any angle.

https://preview.redd.it/q73pknjzf75f1.jpg?width=2400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3e765646a15bdd5dc3dc9bad2082bf2e1242c76

The breakthrough? **Error correction**. QR codes work even when 30% damaged. Perfect for dirty factory floors.

 

# Why This Connects to Building

Every successful tool gets **repurposed beyond its original intent**. APIs started for internal systems, now power every app integration. **Stripe** began for marketplace payments, now handles subscriptions for millions.

Your side project might solve a completely different problem than you planned.

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f18xfDO10UI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f18xfDO10UI)

# The Plot Twist

QR codes flopped in the US for 15 years. **Too clunky, required special apps, nobody cared**. Then COVID hit and restaurants needed contactless menus. Suddenly everyone's phone could scan them natively.

https://preview.redd.it/3exfysq0g75f1.jpg?width=2400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d6898ef0d401c949aa4227cb5d25bef610e7f787

**Perfect timing beats perfect technology**.

 

# What This Teaches Us

Build for the problem in front of you. **Toyota needed faster part tracking, not a marketing revolution**. The best solutions often find their biggest use case years later in completely different industries.

 

**What's the weirdest way you've seen someone repurpose a tool that wasn't built for their use case?** Looking for next week's deep dive into accidental innovations.",1,1749171278.0,ScrollValue,0,1.0,False

Hold On To Your Faith!,"Hi guys I wanted to give a write-up for those are looking for those looking for honest, heartfelt advice, because it took help from many different people, sources, and just overall physical, mental and emotional support to pass it.

Real #1->if you are a believer in faith or spirituality of some sort, always seek that out on your days off because it will strengthen you in a way nothing will. I am humble enough to say I thank God for the miracle he allowed me to have by allowing me to pass this horrid exam. Praise to his name first and foremost.

1st Try:

2nd yr (during and after classes were done)

CBSE: 47

Behavioral: 71

CBSE (2): 55

Behavioral (2/had to remediate the class because it was absurdly hard and that crushed my spirit initially): 71 (surprise surprise)

NBME 27: 52

NBME 28: 57

NBME 29: 84 (outlier)

NBME 30: 64

Free 120: 60

I was using a tutoring service at this point mandated by the school after the 2nd yr. and I was not 100% well mentally due to having lost one of my grandparents and waiting for other familial dominoes to fall as most of my family is dysfunctional and were not taking the loss well, and it severely impacted everyone's mental health. I had to serve as a familial anchor of sorts while also organize an event I had planned mid-year into the school which caused me to lose some traction academically, while also fearing that due to the uncle/aunts/parents could die from the sadness since they are all pushing 50+ and have a litany of comorbidities. Ironically the class that is supposed to be understanding of mental disease was the least understanding of my circumstances and made me re-take the whole damn class just to prove I knew about behavioral diseases. Awesome transition through my 6 month grieving period. By this point through the year, I had done a full pass of AMBOSS qbank once at about a 69% average.

I studied from Pathoma, First Aid, Sketchy, Books and Beyond heavily, and used USMLE-Rx through years 1 and 2 while also hitting the home cooked stuff because the class exams were heavily testing home cooked material in both years, but I supplemented with those and with Anking (I have Ankihub for those who paid the lifetime subscription, well worth it!). I also did a 100% passthrough using UWorld but my average was like 30%, which was super lack-luster and I did not use AMBOSS.

My mistake the first time around was trying to memorize answers and not really going deeper to learn 2nd and 3rd order logic to answering questions, and my crystallized knowledge was also not strong enough for when I hit the exam. The day of the exam was a mess as well because I did not plan accordingly for the traffic in the morning, and that also blindsided me.

The exam itself tested core logic down to very hard minutae that I felt I should have hit in my tutoring services (I won't mention who because I wish to remina anonymous) but during test day the question stems were huge and testing at 3rd or even 4th order logics that I had not seen or prepped for properly.

After the 1st exam and receiving the failing grade, I went down a dark spiral of hopelessness and had to talk to my parent about continuing. They told me the best things in life were worth fighting for and that they supported me no matter who said what, and that was enough for me to don the mental gloves to get back in the ring. I had so much anger welled up inside me at that point I thought I was going to expode, so I seeked out professional mental help to unwind and unpack everything I had gone through plus the ostracisism from failing. There was one colleague who gave me solid advice to believe in myself because I was smart enough to do it, and well, I need to thank that person later because they were the only one out of a huge cohort who kept it real and didn't judge me.

I not only sought out mental help, but I started going to the gym more than I did before my 1st try. I shifted my workout routine to being consistently 2-4/wk. for cardio and weights, vented with my mental resource over my frustrations, and kept going to tutorings to hone in what I had learned before+pick up new techniques.

The 2nd time around I opted to introduce more resources sparingly, and I decided to focus more on crystalizing foundational information, even for the zebras, using strong reps in Anking. When I mean strong, sometimes I did 400-700 reviews a day at 90% pass rates on top of 80 qs per day. You can do more or less but never under 40 and never over 100 because it is a waste of time. I don't recommend doing this many Anki unless you were thoroughly motivated and pissed off like a scorpion like I was, and you have that Rocky mentality like I do. The reasoning for me was practice makes perfect, so I was boxing with that slab of UWorld & AMBOSS meats this time around. You heard correctly.

\*\*\*\*\*I focused more on AMBOSS, UWorld, and Anking with my primary cores, while peppering in FA reviews, NBME reviews as I retook the exams (full exam reviews at least twice before taking the exam helped me through all of the questions understanding the logic completely AND encoding it for long term memory, very important). I also wrote out notes to develop that 2nd and 3rd and 4th order logic that I saw in the 1st sitting so I wouldn't be blindsided again. The Anking tables, images and pictures helped a lot. I also went through and studied the HY images PDF and Anki deck that's floating around somewhere on Reddit that is supposed to be one of the best, which helped me learn the histology and pathology, and not memorize it, same with Anking images. I also highlighted all of the NBME information. I went through toward the last two weeks and did the 200 top questions from AMBOSS and went through the Anki cards of those as well. By the time I went through all of AMBOSS and about 40-50% of UWorld beforehand again, I was at 70% percentile AMBOSS and about 69% percentile in UWorld. Sometimes I would just randomly pick up FA and Pathoma to skim it and test myself on the devilish shit I saw on UWorld or AMBOSS and fill out the gaps in the books from memory. This time I also took all 3 UWSAs and picked them down to the bone as far as info goes and found myself reviewing them twice over, on top of reviewing Anking and doing more UWorld questions in the last two weeks while also reviewing my notes from UWorld and AMBOSS.

Whoever says the UWSAs are too hard and not reflective of the NBME are tripping, UWSAs are a perfect rep of what the exam is, and you need to get used to seeing questions of that order on the exam. I keep shit real.

I used and abused the fields from Anking to fill in the cards with my own observations, details and mnemomnics that popped out that I needed to learn, and I highly recommend that to those that feel they suck at making Anki cards from scratch (I personally am too slow to get good leverage out of it and the Anking cards recently have become so good I don't even have to add stuff to them sometimes). If I felt I need to add histo/path/xrays/memes to the cards, I would do it with memory anchors that helped me.

Pro Tips:

Real #1 if you are a believer in faith or spirituality of some sort, always seek that out on your days off because it will strengthen you in a way nothing will. I am humble enough to say I thank God for the miracle he allowed me to have by allowing me to pass this horrid exam. Praise to his name first and foremost.<-repeated for emphasis

1-If you can meditate and self-test yourself for 30 minutes in a space you don't sleep, you can build and reinforce crystallized data to a degree you know it by heart in order to really actively recall data and apply it

2-Don't memorize the answer, understand pathophys chains and logics and understand the why without getting lost down a rabbit hole. If you get to 4th order point and find yourself going to the 5th, you've gone to far down the rabbit hole and you need to scale back.

3-Practice, practice, practice, repeat, repeat repeat. When I would get a block of UWorld with less than the average in UWorld, I would read all the explanations and try to understand all of the data, then I would repeat the whole block just to make sure I would understand it, and I didnt just answer the question, I would highlight everything in that question related to the answer to build pattern recognition. If I got a low score again that I wasn't satisfied with, I would redo all of the questions again.

4-I studied 6 days a week about 10-12 hours per day while adhering to the fitness goals above. Toward the last 2 weeks, I locked in and tore through Anking like a knife through butter, sometimes just browsing cards to make sure I could plug holes as they sprung open, up until before the exam, to soothe my nerves and feel prepared. Always know yourself and your stamina and what you can put out in a day. I have that dog in me and I released it unchained to go to work for me to pass the exam.

5-Always introduce a rest day and be completely lazy that day and handle your personal stuff that day no matter what. Don't look at material that day. Sleep, go watch movies, unwind. Study days are study days and rest days are rest days and do whatever else you want days.

6-The day before prep is just as important as the day of prep for the exam. Scout where the exam is going to be, go to the testing center and scout parking, parking fees, areas to park in, distance between where you are staying and what you are doing, restaurants, supplies you need for the day of the exam and the day before in case you need to go to another town, and accomadations. Go all out like the Batman on the planning, it will not dissapoint you. Healthy carb and protein load in the afternoon in the day before so you have reserve energy in the tank in the event you do not feel like eating during exam day.

7-Day of the exam, make sure you wake up nice and early, do calesthenics if you feel you need to, if not, make sure you eat a tuna sandwhich (if you're not allergic, if not some other canned fatty fish that has pectin for that mental boost) and one cup of boogey coffee from your favorite coffee place to get you in the right spirits. Pack crackers, sweets, an emergency can of an energy drink, and an emergency ration of Starkist tuna packets of your flavor of choice in the event your stomach wants protein, if it just needs carb energy to burn, boogey sweets like Pokey and Milano cookies are a good way to go, Double Chocolate saved me that day.

Remember Alfred from Bale Batman movies: ""Why do we fall, sir? So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.""  That's how you pass this exam.

TLDR; AMBOSS+UWorld+Anking heavy duty, do \~80qs and at least 300+ card reviews every day, don't drown in too many resources, focus on learning 2nd, 3rd order connections and crystallizing knowledge with active recall, discipline, practice and repetition. UWSAs for difficulty stress testing, NBMEs for foundational knowledge and review (review them at least twice over after taking once is my recommendation or as many times as needed until you know them by heart along with the images), and there are no shortcuts or being laid back for this exam. Prep for the day before the exam and day of the exam also like Batman.

1l4fivt,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1l4fivt/using_stars_for_restroom/,Using Stars For Restroom,"I've just had the worst Starbucks experience that I think I've ever had in my entire life.

After ordering a coffee I needed to use the restroom. The Starbucks that I was in doesn't have a restroom, but the one a couple of blocks away does. Anyone who works at Starbucks can already see the problem due to the policies that y'all have in place. 

At the next Starbucks that I've also spent quite a bit of money at, and I've done this before over many years, they say no, even after furnishing the receipts, because it's the policy, and they cannot deviate from the policy. There isn't anything that I need to purchase at the second Starbucks, because I've already purchased it at the first Starbucks. What I need is to use the restroom, and maybe a moment to think about where to find a restroom, so I sit down for a minute.

I'm not sure where to use the restroom at in this moment, and this policy which they said had been in place for a few months now seems impolite to me, so I spend a little time finding the customer support number and give it a call, hoping maybe they can help me figure this out. 

While I am on the phone with customer support, one of the baristas come over and try and talk to me and I ask for a moment since I'm on the phone with Starbucks customer support. The barista does not give me a moment, which is where the situation goes from being just kinda sad and unfortunate really bad. I'm talking to Starbucks customer support in one ear, I need to use the restroom which is the problem I'm trying to solve, and there's now one or two different baristas trying to tell me what their restroom policy is and that I need to finish my call outside of the store because I haven't bought anything yet.  
  
Nobody yelled at me, and I didn't yell at anyone. I was sitting pretty quietly at a table while I was on the phone, and for not all that long. I did let the baristas in the store know that I was on the phone with Starbucks customer support, and I walked outside of the store because it's hard to have two conversations at the same time, and that is what they appeared to want. 

Standing outside of the store on the phone with customer support they ask me my member number, and I'm looking at my Starbucks card and I figure out that I probably just spend 100 stars to get a free coffee, and just tell them not to make the coffee because I've already had a Starbucks coffee at a different Starbucks store. At 2 stars for every 1$, that's 50$ I've spent, right?

Which is the reason for the title of this post. Maybe just let me use stars to use the restroom? That way I don't need to be wasteful and buy something that I don't really want, but I can still use the restroom. Does that end up being a win for everyone at that point?  Maybe scan my app to let me use the restroom, just tell me how much it costs and I'll pay it. It doesn't feel great, but it seems to be the transactional world that we live in.

Customer support ended up giving me 25$. I didn't ask for 25$ it's just what they gave me, I wanted to use the restroom, but I figure I can go back into the store and purchase something, maybe something from the counter that I can leave behind or give to someone else so that I can use the restroom, because I don't really need anything else. At this point is where it went from being a bad experience to being a horrible no good worst Starbucks experience that I've ever had, because they still said no, they already told me to leave so I'm not allowed to buy anything anymore. I'm confused, customer support gave me money to spend at a Starbucks store, and when I tried to spend it to solve this problem, they said no. I still need to use the restroom. I feel bad. It all feels strange and surreal. 

When I tried to spend some of that money that Starbucks had just given me, to use the restroom from Starbucks stores that I've spent a lot of money in, they told me that couldn't spend that money now because they had already asked me to leave. I am so confused at this point and still need to use the restroom.

Now I'm wondering if I'm a bad person..? Why did this experience go so horribly wrong..? How did something so simple, drinking some coffee and then having that coffee causing me to need use the restroom, make everyone feel so bad...? Why wasn't this simple..? Why don't the stores cooperate with each other..? Is there really that much bad blood between stores..? Can I ever go back to that store again..? It's all spinning, spinning, spinning in my head. Something that should have been so simple, using the restroom after buying and drinking some coffee at your stores, became so difficult.

You talk about joy, and rewards, and customer loyalty, but this is none of that. One of your baristas had the audacity to say that they have told the other store to stop sending people up there. It sounds like your stores aren't even being kind to each other, and aren't here to help each other out. Isn't this an opportunity to let members of the community know that there are other stores nearby? Or are you just so global and corporate that you no longer care about community, and about helping out nearby stores. It's just numbers and transactions now. Buy or get out. I don't care if you've bought before, I don't remember you, I don't know who you are, you don't know any of us, we don't really care about you. Go away.

We are all just cogs in this uncaring system that doesn't remember who we are, and only wants us for our money and our work. I didn't spend money in your store after spending money in your other store in a few moments before I asked, and when I attempted to spend the money that you had given me you told me to go away, so I went away. Strange really. 

Now I'm here on an online forum, writing a story about a bad experience, and it's all just pretty sad and pathetic. I feel bad, I'm making others feel bad, they had a bad day, I had a bad day, and I'm sure this is just making it worse for everyone.

When your coworker asks, ""How's your weekend?"" they're not just filling the silence. They're checking your vibe - are you stressed, excited, distracted? That quick read tells them whether to approach you with a big project or just leave you alone to get your coffee first.

Those few minutes of ""Nice weather today"" or ""Traffic was crazy"" do something subtle but valuable. They're like a social warm-up that says ""Hey, we're both here, we're both normal humans, and we can interact like civilized people."" It makes everything else easier.

Think about it - your random chats with the grocery clerk, your neighbor, or the security guard at work might seem forgettable, but they're building something. These casual connections are often the ones who mention job openings, help you when you're in a pinch, or just make your day a little brighter when you need it.

And honestly? Making small talk when you're having a terrible day is actually good practice. It teaches you how to function socially even when you don't feel like it, which is a surprisingly useful life skill.

Plus, taking thirty seconds to acknowledge another person's existence is just... nice. It's a tiny moment of human connection that costs nothing but makes both people feel a little more seen.

Today was a massive day for $ATYR. Sanjay Shukla just took the spotlight at the Jefferies Global Healthcare Conference, barely a day after aTyr released those important SSC-ILD results. This kind of back-to-back action doesn’t happen often, and for anyone who’s been following the story, it feels like we’re watching things accelerate in real time.

**Heads up: this is a long read.** I’ve gone through the entire fireside chat, pulled apart every key point, and tried to lay out exactly what was said, what was signalled, and what it all could mean from an institutional perspective. If you’re after more than just the headlines, I think you’ll find a lot of value in the detail here.

## Introduction: The Jefferies Healthcare Conference and aTyr’s Strategic Fireside Chat

The Jefferies Global Healthcare Conference is a major fixture in the institutional biotech calendar, attracting a high concentration of investors, analysts, and senior management from leading public and private life sciences companies. Its New York setting and multi-day format ensure high visibility for any company in attendance—especially those approaching pivotal data or inflection points. The fireside chat format, in particular, is designed for unscripted, interactive dialogue between management and a senior analyst, giving the audience a rare window into the thinking, confidence, and preparedness of executive teams under real-time questioning.

aTyr Pharma’s presence at Jefferies this year was particularly significant. Coming immediately after the company’s positive SSC-ILD update and with the pivotal Phase 3 sarcoidosis readout fast approaching, CEO Sanjay Shukla’s appearance provided not only the latest clinical and commercial signals, but also an opportunity to shape institutional perception and address investor concerns head-on. The analysis below dissects the fireside chat—what was said, what was implied, and what it means for aTyr’s set-up as one of today’s most closely watched catalyst names in rare disease biotech.

---

## 1. Clinical and Statistical Integrity: Sarcoidosis Phase 3 Baseline & Endpoint Design

Shukla began by detailing the Phase 3 baseline data, making it clear that demographic factors—race, gender, age, and mean prednisone entry dose of 10.5mg—were closely aligned with both prior studies and real-world clinical practice. He emphasised that the 7.5–25mg window was chosen to mirror the realities of US, European, and Japanese sarcoidosis management, and openly discussed the deliberate exclusion of “peri-fibrotic” patients via CT to ensure a more homogeneous, treatable group.

He also explained the FDA-driven endpoint refinement: rather than a nine-month AUC, the primary endpoint became absolute reduction in daily steroid dose during the final four weeks. This, he pointed out, was more than a technical change—by lowering standard deviation, it materially improved the trial’s power. Both the 3mg/kg and 5mg/kg arms, Shukla stated, are individually powered above 90% for a ≥3mg effect versus placebo.

**Analysis:**

- Shukla’s explanation here signalled a meticulous, disciplined approach—aligning trial design to maximise both regulatory and clinical relevance. This is a setup where the company is positioned to deliver a clear “yes or no” answer, with minimal ambiguity.
- The way he framed the FDA endpoint shift strongly suggests a trial that, if successful, will face little regulatory resistance and will be straightforward for payers and guideline committees to interpret.
- The combination of operational clarity and regulatory buy-in is a subtle but powerful message: if efzofitimod works, the result will be unmissable.

---

## 2. Clinical Meaningfulness, Real-World Practice, and Expert Consensus

Shukla placed strong emphasis on what “meaningful” really means in daily practice, anchoring his remarks in both hard data and lived patient experience. He explained that even a 1mg reduction in daily steroid dose accumulates to a substantial impact over a year, and directly ties to morbidity reduction for patients who otherwise face life-long complications from steroid toxicity—such as diabetes, hypertension, and organ damage.

He brought forward the current shift in KOL thinking, highlighting a Delphi consensus among top experts that defines ≥50% reduction in steroid dose, or being able to manage patients at ≤5mg/day, as the new threshold for practice-changing therapy. Shukla made clear that Phase 3 was built to deliver on this bar, not simply achieve statistical significance, and connected this to the design differences between Phase 2 and 3: longer trial duration, forced withdrawal to zero, and more granular steroid tapering to elicit a visible, real-world benefit.

He also called attention to the “steroid-free holiday” outcome—citing emerging data and KOL experience showing that even temporary liberation from steroids can be transformative, and is already drawing the attention of both regulators and payers as a meaningful endpoint.

**Analysis:**

- Shukla’s focus on these nuances demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of how guidelines are written, and how practice patterns change—not just what’s required to achieve regulatory approval. By anchoring the conversation in patient outcomes (rather than abstract statistics), he is aligning aTyr’s story with the tangible, emotionally resonant impact sought by guideline committees, insurers, and patient advocacy groups.
- This dual focus—statistical rigour and practical meaning—is rare for a small/mid-cap biotech, and positions aTyr to achieve not just “approval,” but rapid adoption and reimbursement.
- By shaping the future standard for sarcoidosis management (rather than reacting to it), aTyr is also pre-empting the classic challenge where a new drug is approved but rarely used. If Phase 3 delivers a robust steroid-free subgroup and significant mean reductions, it could trigger an immediate shift in treatment algorithms globally.
- This approach sets up aTyr for meaningful pricing discussions, giving payers a clear value proposition: durable steroid reduction means not just improved quality of life, but also fewer hospitalisations and complications, and thus long-term system-wide cost savings.

---

## 3. Regulatory Signalling and Risk Profile

Shukla provided a granular account of aTyr’s regulatory strategy, making it clear that both trial arms were engineered to be independently pivotal, and that all major powering and endpoint decisions were pre-cleared with the FDA. He stressed that absolute change, rather than percentage change, is now the anchor for primary endpoint analysis—directly aligning with agency guidance and eliminating the risk of post-hoc reinterpretation.

He described the recent meeting with the FDA as a critical inflection, ensuring there would be no surprises at data lock. This proactive approach, coupled with dual-arm powering, is more than belt-and-braces—it virtually eliminates the “dose-response miss” scenario and increases the probability of regulatory and commercial success regardless of which dose ultimately leads.

**Analysis:**

- Shukla’s explicit messaging to the institutional audience was that aTyr is not simply “hoping” for a win—it has structured its pivotal readout to withstand scrutiny and maximise flexibility. The company is positioned for fast-track review and global expansion, given the clarity and real-world nature of its endpoints.
- The regulatory narrative also plays directly into the M&A and partnership angle. By pre-negotiating every statistical and clinical nuance, aTyr is removing layers of uncertainty that usually drive down acquisition premiums or delay launches.
- Shukla’s candour around regulatory process, including pre-hoc alignment and dual-shot design, is calculated to attract sophisticated buyers and larger-cap partners who are increasingly intolerant of messy or ambiguous clinical files.

---

## 4. Market Opportunity, Population Expansion, and Commercial Buildout

When asked about commercial potential, Shukla updated the market on the US patient base: according to new claims data, there are 150,000–160,000 steroid-dependent patients—significantly higher than what most previous models had assumed. He mentioned that off-label infliximab users (15,000–20,000) would likely convert rapidly, especially as there are currently no approved therapies.

He spoke openly about payer conversations, referencing the “low $100k’s” per annum as an achievable price point, with upside if the trial hits more transformative endpoints. Shukla also signalled that the company is not waiting for results to start commercial buildout—leadership and board are prioritising readiness to meet immediate demand.

**Analysis:**

- Shukla’s framing here shows the market that aTyr is not simply angling for a buyout; this is a team prepared to go all the way to commercial launch if necessary. That stance alone increases the company’s leverage in future negotiations.
- The recalibrated patient population, when combined with the pricing signals, supports a much larger TAM than most current sell-side models capture.
- The focus on rapid conversion of infliximab patients, plus readiness for immediate demand, provides credible “upside optionality” for institutional models.

---

## 5. Competitive Landscape, Mechanism of Action, and Platform Value

Shukla provided a direct critique of the competitive environment, naming failed Novartis efforts with IL-17 inhibitors, as well as unsuccessful anti-IL-1 and anti-GM-CSF strategies, all of which lacked durable clinical effect in sarcoidosis. He framed efzofitimod’s pan-cytokine, macrophage-modulating mechanism as fundamentally different, explicitly designed to address the complex, multi-nodal pathogenesis of the disease.

He underlined aTyr’s five- to six-year clinical lead and the unique status of being the only company to have completed a global Phase 3 in sarcoidosis. Shukla discussed how this gap is not simply a function of time but is a function of mechanistic insight, IP, data quality, and operational execution.

**Analysis:**

- By being specific about competitor failures and naming names, Shukla not only enhances aTyr’s credibility but directly signals strategic scarcity to institutional and strategic investors. In biotech M&A, lead time is only valuable if it is defensible; here, he made it clear that others have tried and failed due to limitations in both science and trial design.
- The way he tied mechanistic differentiation to clinical outcomes goes beyond the typical “me too” asset story. aTyr’s IP, mechanistic, and operational moat is designed to persist well into the next decade. This sets up a rare scenario where the first-in-class drug is also best-in-class, and is likely to enjoy significant pricing and negotiating leverage for years.
- By framing aTyr’s lead as both temporal and qualitative, Shukla is inviting large-cap suitors to view the company not simply as a target, but as a potential foundational platform in pulmonary and systemic immunology.

---

## 6. SSC-ILD Data and Pipeline Optionality

Shukla highlighted interim results from the SSC-ILD study, emphasising that three out of four diffuse SSc patients achieved >4-point mRSS improvement at 12 weeks—a response rarely seen in this population. He explained why skin improvement is both clinically meaningful and essentially unprecedented, as even recently approved therapies have not demonstrated robust skin activity.

He was transparent about the limitations of read-through between skin and lung endpoints, but made clear that this interim data suggests efzofitimod’s mechanism has systemic, not just organ-specific, effects. Shukla indicated that this could support expansion into a wider range of fibrotic and autoimmune diseases.

**Analysis:**

- Shukla’s presentation of SSC-ILD data was as much about narrative as science. By grounding the early results in both clinical context and mechanistic logic, he prepared the audience for the next leg of the aTyr platform story: expansion beyond sarcoidosis.
- The direct mention of a multi-indication platform subtly shifts the valuation paradigm from “single-asset binary” to “multi-asset rare disease leader.” Institutional investors and strategic partners are now encouraged to model out not just one but several high-value catalysts in the coming years.
- This approach also increases the attractiveness of licensing or regional partnership deals, further strengthening aTyr’s capital and strategic flexibility.

---

## 7. Capital Structure and Cash Runway

Shukla addressed capital directly, assuring the audience that aTyr is fully funded through the pivotal readout and for at least one year beyond. He clarified that there is no need for a near-term equity raise, and the board is positioned to preserve shareholder value through the critical inflection window.

**Analysis:**

- The combination of a clean cap table and no financing overhang is an essential technical strength heading into a binary catalyst. This not only increases the magnitude of any post-readout move but also gives aTyr more negotiating leverage—whether for partnerships, licensing, or outright M&A.
- For institutional investors, this setup is a classic “tight float” scenario, amplifying both potential returns and market reflexivity if the data deliver. It is a material differentiator versus other pre-readout biotech names, many of which are encumbered by looming dilution risk.

---

## 8. Behavioural and Signalling Analysis: Shukla’s Delivery and Institutional Positioning

Throughout the fireside chat, Shukla’s delivery was poised, technically precise, and institutionally targeted. He answered each question with specificity, volunteered risk where appropriate, and resisted overstatement—particularly regarding read-through from SSC-ILD to sarcoidosis. He balanced operational confidence with real-world humility, demonstrating that the leadership team understands both the scale of the opportunity and the complexity of execution.

**Analysis:**

- This style of delivery—what might be called “confident restraint”—is particularly valued in a pre-catalyst context. It minimises the risk of investor disappointment, encourages institutional buy-and-hold behaviour, and provides comfort to both regulators and potential partners.
- Shukla’s ability to integrate clinical, regulatory, and commercial narratives into each answer is a signal that the board and management are aligned, well-briefed, and executing a cohesive strategy. This might also explain the surge in institutional volume and float-tightening seen post-conference.
- Close observation leads me to believe that Shukla appears a little tired, but who could blame him with his recent schedule!

---

## 9. Market Structure, Trading Context, and Price Action

Following the Jefferies appearance, ATYR saw more than 3 million shares trade hands in a single day—a significant surge compared to average volume. The share price closed at $5.35, reflecting demand and confidence from both institutional and retail participants. This price move consolidated the gains prior to the release of the SSC-ILD data.

**Analysis:**

- This type of price/volume action, especially in the immediate aftermath of a high-visibility event, is classic evidence of institutional accumulation. There was no sign of distribution or profit-taking; instead, this was a clear float-tightening move, with buyers competing for limited available supply ahead of a major binary event.
- The market structure is now highly favourable for a significant price dislocation if the Phase 3 data are robust. With a relatively clean cap table, elevated institutional interest, and low retail churn, the stage is set for sharp price discovery, particularly if new buyers are forced to chase on positive news.
- As the pivotal readout approaches, the risk/reward profile becomes increasingly asymmetric. The float is increasingly controlled by strong hands, short interest faces real squeeze potential, and any positive catalyst is likely to trigger rapid, outsized upward moves as demand overwhelms available liquidity.
- Share price implications in this kind of setup can be dramatic. In similar scenarios with tightly held biotechs, it is not uncommon to see post-catalyst moves of 100–300% within days, as new buyers, forced cover, and FOMO dynamics converge. The lack of any significant immediate dilution risk only adds to the potential for reflexive upward momentum.
- For those monitoring the tape closely, the combination of heavy volume, a strong closing price at $5.35, and high institutional participation is about as bullish a technical and market-structure setup as you can find heading into a major data event.

## 10. Valuation and Strategic Optionality

All the preceding factors—clinical discipline, regulatory clarity, market expansion, competitive scarcity, and platform potential—converge to form a robust, multi-billion dollar valuation case for aTyr. During the Jefferies fireside chat, Shukla’s commentary and demeanour made it clear that the company sees itself as both a future commercial leader in rare disease and a highly attractive M&A target.

**Valuation for Sarcoidosis Alone:**
- *US Market Opportunity:* With 150,000–160,000 steroid-dependent sarcoidosis patients in the US, and an anticipated net annual price of ~$100,000 per patient, the addressable US market is $15–16 billion.
- *Initial Penetration Scenario:* Even a conservative 10–15% penetration in the first three years (15,000–24,000 patients) would translate to $1.5–2.4 billion in annual US revenue, not including EU or Japan.
- *Valuation Multiple Benchmarking:* Recent rare disease and immunology M&A deals have ranged from 6x to over 12x revenue multiples. Examples:
    - **Sanofi/Principia Biopharma (2020):** $3.68bn buyout, 6–9x peak sales
    - **AstraZeneca/Alexion (2020):** $39bn, 6.5x trailing, 10–12x peak
    - **Amgen/Horizon Therapeutics (2022):** $27.8bn, estimated 6–10x
- Using a 7x multiple on $2bn in peak US revenue implies a $14 billion takeout valuation for sarcoidosis alone.
- *Share Price Implications:* With approximately 86 million shares outstanding, a $14bn valuation would equate to ~$163/share (pre-dilution, pre-tax), representing a potential 20x or greater move from current levels.

**Implications for M&A:**
- *Scarcity Drives Premiums:* The combination of a five- to six-year clinical lead, strong IP, and failed competitor programs leaves aTyr as the “last one standing” for a large, untapped market. Strategic buyers—particularly large-cap pharma facing immunology patent cliffs—may be incentivised to bid aggressively for first-mover advantage.
- *M&A Scenario:* In a competitive auction with two or more bidders, historical precedent suggests that rare disease assets can be taken out at 10x+ forward sales, especially if guideline adoption is swift and real-world value is clear. A $2bn sales run-rate could see offers in the $16–20 billion range, pushing share prices above $180–$230 per share in a hot M&A scenario, before platform expansion is even priced in.

**Platform Expansion and Upside Optionality:**
- *Beyond Sarcoidosis:* If efzofitimod’s efficacy extends to SSC-ILD and additional fibrotic/autoimmune indications, each new orphan disease could add $1–3 billion in addressable market size.
- *Platform Revenue Potential:* Adding just two more indications with similar pricing and uptake could push combined peak revenue above $5 billion, supporting a platform valuation of $30–40 billion in a full expansion scenario.
- *Platform-Adjusted Share Price:* At $30bn, the implied per-share value (undiluted) would be ~$350/share; if aTyr is acquired as a platform play, share price outcomes could be substantially higher, depending on competitive tension and asset scarcity.

**A Note on Dilution:**
- *Current Positioning:* aTyr is currently funded through at least a year beyond the Phase 3 readout, so near-term dilution risk is low. This is crucial—should M&A or a large re-rating occur shortly after readout, the vast majority of upside will accrue to existing shareholders.
- *Post-Readout Dilution Scenarios:* If aTyr remains independent and raises capital to support commercialisation, a typical biotech offering (e.g., 10–15% dilution) would reduce per-share outcomes proportionally. For example, 10% dilution post-readout lowers $163/share to about $148/share (all else equal). Even with moderate dilution, the scale of value creation would remain transformative versus current levels.
- *Platform Expansion Dilution:* Larger commercial ambitions or global launches would require more capital, but even under such scenarios, the per-share value creation from successful clinical and commercial execution would far outstrip any dilution impact.

**Summary Table for Context:**

| Scenario                    | Implied Valuation | Per-Share Value* |
|-----------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Sarcoidosis Only (7x)       | $14bn            | ~$163            |
| Sarc. M&A Premium (10x)     | $20bn            | ~$232            |
| Platform (3 indications)    | $30–40bn         | ~$350–$465       |

*Assumes 86 million shares, pre-dilution, pre-tax

> **Important Note:**  
> These numbers are *illustrative and indicative only*. They reflect post-commercialisation and/or M&A modelling scenarios and are not intended as guaranteed share price targets, nor should they be interpreted as immediate post-readout outcomes. Actual market behaviour will depend on a wide range of factors, including execution, adoption, capital structure, dilution, market sentiment, and broader sector conditions. I’m always open to challenge or discussion on these figures—thoughtful debate is welcome.

For both institutional investors and strategic acquirers, this setup is rare—scarcity value, first-mover status, and credible, multi-layered upside. Whether aTyr remains independent or is acquired, the path is open to substantial value creation far beyond typical biotech binary outcomes.

## Conclusion

Shukla’s appearance at Jefferies marked a pivotal point for aTyr Pharma. The measured, fact-rich narrative—grounded in what was said, clarified, and signalled—demonstrated not only a readiness for the coming Phase 3 catalyst, but also a credible claim to best-in-class, first-in-class, and platform-level potential. The combination of rigorous trial design, clear commercial thinking, institutional market structure, and real scarcity value sets up one of the most compelling asymmetric opportunities in the sector ahead of readout.

But I cannot be honest, because that would mean telling everyone to F off, to say no I dislike every person in this class, to say no I really don't care about what is being thought in the class it, to say I think your hobbies are stupid. I could give more examples but I think you understand. If I am to be honest it means being outside of what is acceptable or expected. 

It's like during a job interview, or at your job. And you have to be an ambitious team player that is willing to learn! Like come on I'm a god damn cashier and serve coffee! I hate it! When it comes to that I am not ambitious, a team player nor do I care to learn. I can't even tell my coworkers that because 90% of them are spies for the boss I swear to god.

Each time, I would hear their voices filling the next room and turn on the recording to record them.

Five years and ninety-eight times.

Today, it was a fresh-faced, delicate college student.

Once they were done, Blake called for me to come in and clean up.

Kendall Davis lay lazily in his arms, a teasing smile playing on her lips as she spoke, ""Blake, is this the old, ugly wife you mentioned? ""

Blake idly ran his fingers through Kendall’s hair, offering nothing more than a dismissive grunt.

Kendall tossed the blanket aside, her skin marked with fresh hickeys, her grin wide. ""See? This is how a man reacts to a young, beautiful woman. As a woman, you really failed.""

I stayed silent, my gaze fixed on the floor, as I quietly cleaned up the mess.

Their laughter echoed through the room, a cruel reminder of the silence that surrounded me.

Once I retreated to my room, I pulled out the divorce agreement from the safe.

Five years had passed, and in all that time, it felt as though I had forgotten Blake and I were only bound by a contract.

One week. Just one more week and the divorce would be final.

——

The next morning, I woke early, as I always did.

Blake had already called me three times, demanding breakfast in his bedroom.

Without a second thought, I refused.

""Don't you have hands or feet? Should I feed you bite by bite?""

I ended the call just as Blake stormed into the room, his finger jabbing at me.

""Laura, who are you throwing a tantrum at? Don’t forget whose house you're in and who you're talking to!""

I didn’t respond. Instead, I lifted my eyes to meet his, studying the face I’d once known so well, the face I had loved.

I knew he had never loved me, but the sting came from realizing that, for five years, he had never truly seen me as a part of his life.

Finally, I lowered my gaze, my voice soft but firm. ""I’ll leave this house sooner or later.""

His anger flared, his voice rising. ""Leave this house? You’ve been living off me all this time. How will you survive when you’re gone?""

Before I could reply, Kendall’s voice cut through the tension, lazy and dripping with sarcasm.

""Oh, the old woman’s throwing a tantrum again? What’s wrong? Getting old and can’t bear seeing Blake with younger, prettier women?""

“If it bothers you so much, why don’t you just strip off your clothes and crawl into Blake’s bed? But—""

She laughed, the sound sharp and mocking. ""With that face, no man would even blink.""

I slammed the spoon down onto the table, the sound sharp and sudden, like a match sparking something deep inside me.

Blake, who had been standing nearby, scoffed.

“Did Kendall say something wrong? Are you throwing another tantrum?”

I pressed my lips together, silently clearing away the half-eaten cereal before heading toward the kitchen.

Kendall’s triumphant voice floated from the dining room. “This is too good. Just stay obedient and play your part as the old housewife.”

“Enough, stop talking.”

Blake’s tone was scolding, but I could hear the underlying indulgence in his words.

I stared at the faucet, my thoughts drifting like a fog, so much so that I almost let the water overflow.

Then, a hand reached from behind and turned off the faucet.

“What are you lost in?”

The voice was too close, and when I turned, I found myself trapped in Blake’s intense, unreadable gaze.

I lowered my head again, focusing on the dishes in front of me.

“It’s nothing. I was just thinking about what comes next after the divorce.”

“Divorce?” Blake’s voice was laced with amusement as if I’d just told him a joke. “You’ve been with me since college, playing the dutiful housewife for five years. You’ve been cut off from the world. After we part ways, what will you even do?”



Chapter 2

“Housekeeper? Or just a maid cleaning up after everyone else?”

Those words, sharp and cruel, echoed in my mind, a refrain I had grown all too familiar with.

At first, they stung, cutting through me like a sharp blade. I found myself questioning, doubting if I really was as worthless as they painted me to be.

But five years ago, I was just as young and radiant as Kendall.

Five years ago, my world had shattered. In an instant, my parents were ripped from me in a tragic accident, leaving only me and my ten-year-old brother battling leukemia.

Desperation had taken root in me, and there was no choice but to drop out of school. I juggled part-time jobs, anything to afford his treatment.

The quickest way to earn money? A nightclub, where I ended up as an escort.

When a client humiliated me, a bottle crashing into my forehead, I thought I’d reached the bottom.

But then, a hand reached down from the darkness, pulling me out.

That was the first time I met Blake.

He had appeared like an angel in my life, lifting me from the flames of my misery.

And in that moment, he offered me a lifeline, an unexpected marriage contract.

Five million in exchange for five years of my life.

I agreed.

He said he needed a wife to quiet his family's expectations, someone with a spotless past, and that he didn’t want me out in public often, only allowing me to go out twice a week.

I agreed.

So, I spent those five years almost entirely inside this grand mansion.

As for Blake, I thought I loved him. I accepted this ""imprisonment,"" and, oddly, I even found a strange comfort in it.

I truly believed I could be his wife forever.

But he never touched me, never allowed me into his inner world.

Then, one day, when he wasn’t home, I couldn’t fight the temptation any longer. I sneaked into his bedroom, and that’s when the truth hit me like a slap in the face.

Blake had always had a lover.

Kendall.

His five-years-younger neighbor.

I had long grown numb to Blake’s endless parade of women. To me, they were nothing more than fleeting distractions. And I, in my quiet submission, held onto the title of ""Mrs. Wilson"" as if it were a badge of honor.

But yesterday changed everything. The moment I saw Kendall stroll into that bedroom, the one I had never been allowed to set foot in for five years, it hit me like a jolt of electricity. I finally understood. It was time to leave.

""Laura?"" Blake’s voice sliced through my thoughts, thick with impatience. ""What’s going on in that head of yours?""

""You called me useless, right?"" I replied coolly, turning to face him. ""Maybe it’s time I find a job. A housekeeper, a maid, "" I paused, locking eyes with him. ""Five years. I haven’t broken any laws. Should I just waste away here forever?""

Blake opened his mouth to speak, but before he could, Kendall stepped out, sliding into a pristine, brand-new couture dress. It was the same dress Blake had kept locked away, never worn, waiting for the right moment. And now it was on Kendall.

""I didn’t expect you to know my size so well,"" she purred, twirling in front of him. The fabric swirled gracefully around her, her smile gleaming. ""Do you think it looks good?""

Blake took Kendall's hand, his usual indifference replaced by something soft, almost affectionate.

""They look amazing,"" he said, nodding. ""As long as you love them, I’ll buy you anything.""

And then, right there in front of me, they kissed.

Kendall, her cheeks tinged with a hint of shyness, reluctantly pulled away from Blake. ""There are others here..."" she murmured, her eyes briefly flickering to me. ""Do you think the dress Blake chose for me looks good?""

The dress clung to Kendall’s form, a shimmering fabric that wrapped around her like it had been made for her, luxurious, radiant, and perfectly suited to her youthful charm.

I nodded; my voice was soft yet genuine as I met her gaze.

""They’re stunning.""



Chapter 3

Kendall froze, momentarily caught off guard by my words. She stood there, her gaze flickering as if weighing my intent.

Blake’s brows furrowed, though his expression remained as unreadable as ever.

Seizing the chance, I silently slipped away from the kitchen, feeling a sense of liberation with each step I took.

The divorce agreement would take effect in a week, and I had only that precious time to pack my life and leave this place behind.

Back in the bedroom, I scrolled through rental listings on my phone, absorbed in my thoughts, when Blake’s voice cut through the air.

""I need to head to the company for a bit. Kendall will stay here, so you’ll take care of her.""

I raised an eyebrow, the confusion creeping into my tone. ""Am I now a housekeeper? Is she so helpless that she needs me to babysit her?""

I had always bowed to his commands without a second thought, but today, something had shifted in me. I found myself questioning him, challenging his authority with every word.

His face darkened, his voice dropping low and menacing. ""Laura, don’t forget who’s been keeping you. You’re here because of me, and you’ll do as I say. Don’t push me.""

I swallowed the bitter taste of my pride, nodding with reluctant compliance, the weight of his words pressing heavily on my chest.

Before leaving, Blake issued one last warning, his voice low and edged with authority. ""Kendall’s young. You’re responsible for her while I’m gone. If anything happens, don’t think I’ll let you off easy.""

With those words lingering in the air, Blake leaned down to kiss Kendall’s forehead, a tender, possessive gesture before he strode out, the sound of the door clicking shut reverberating in the silence.

Now, with only Kendall and me left in the living room, the atmosphere shifted. She slouched against the sofa, a mischievous smile tugging at her lips.

""I heard you’ve been married to Blake for five years,"" she said, her voice thick with amusement.

""Yes,"" I replied, my tone calm and measured, betraying nothing of the storm brewing inside me.

""But last night, he told me he’s never touched you!"" Kendall’s posture shifted as she tossed her hair back, revealing the dark mark on her neck. ""You must be twenty-six by now, still a …"" Her words hung in the air, sharp and probing.

She giggled, swaying gracefully like a delicate flower, before continuing, ""You must’ve heard us last night, right? Blake made sure you could hear everything from the next room. Oh, and I almost forgot, you’ve never experienced a man, have you? Especially someone as strong as Blake.""

Her laughter was almost too much to bear. ""What a shame. At your age, I doubt anyone would touch you, except for maybe you chasing after them, right?""

I furrowed my brows, disbelief creeping into my thoughts. I hadn’t expected Blake’s hidden rose to speak with such venom.

Calmly, I answered, ""Everyone lives their life differently. I don’t base my existence on any man.""

Kendall’s laughter stopped abruptly, replaced by a sneer. ""A woman who’s been living off a man, playing housewife for five years, probably has no room to talk, huh?""

I chose not to engage further, sitting down on the opposite end of the sofa as I continued my search for a place to rent.

Kendall couldn’t stand the sight of me remaining so calm and composed. It didn’t take long for her to start pushing my buttons, trying to boss me around.

The last time, she complained that the coffee I made was too cold and demanded I pour boiling water to fix it. Then, with the slyest of smiles, she pretended to spill it—most of the water splashed onto me while just a few drops landed on her wrist.

Her cry echoed through the room, sharp and dramatic.

""Blake, it hurts so much...""

By the time Blake rushed in, his face twisted in alarm, Kendall was already in full meltdown mode.

She showed him the small burn on her wrist, and he fussed over it for a moment before turning to me, his anger flaring.

With a forceful slap, he sent me crashing to the ground.

""Didn’t I tell you to take care of Kendall? Is this how you do it?!""

His voice was cold with fury. ""If even the smallest mark appears on her, I’ll make sure you suffer ten times worse.""

Without another word, Blake grabbed Kendall and rushed her off to the hospital, leaving me kneeling on the floor.

I lifted my nightgown, the red welts on my thighs already burning with the sting of the water.



Chapter 4

I lowered my gaze, the world before me slipping into a haze. Large, hot tears splashed onto my swollen knees.

The pain from the wound was sharp, but it barely scratched the surface compared to the ache in my heart.

I hailed a taxi, the loneliness in the backseat a cruel reminder of what I was leaving behind.

As the doctor tended to my injury, she muttered about the patient in the next room, her tone dripping with sarcasm.

""These girls today are just so spoiled,"" she sighed. ""A tiny burn, barely the size of a fingernail, and her boyfriend called the director. He threatened to shut down the whole hospital if she got a scar...""

She paused, a wistful tone taking over. ""You don’t get it. That’s what it means to be loved. I envy her. She has it all—handsome, rich, devoted. She’s got a man who’d do anything for her...""

I stared down at the grotesque burn on my thigh, an involuntary sneer twisting my lips.

Blake was indeed the perfect man from the outside—handsome, wealthy, and all-consuming. But what did it all mean without love?

After the doctor finished, I sat on a bench outside the ward, trying to steady myself, lost in thought.

Then, Blake and Kendall appeared, walking toward me.

When Blake saw the bandages on my leg, his frown deepened.

""You got hurt too? Why didn’t you say anything?""

Before I could answer, he continued, his tone judgmental. ""Well, that’s your fault. You can’t even carry a cup of water properly. Luckily, Kendall didn’t get hurt. Otherwise...""

Blake, ever the picture of cold indifference, stood there, his arms wrapped tightly around Kendall.

Kendall leaned sweetly into him, her voice soft with feigned innocence. ""Don’t blame her, Blake. It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have been so selfish, asking her to take care of me...""

Blake’s arms tightened around Kendall protectively as if he were shielding her from any harm.

""Don’t be silly. I’ve raised her for five years. Even if you treat her like a servant, it’s still your responsibility.""

""As long as you’re happy, you can make her do anything,"" Kendall added, her voice dripping with sweetness.

With that, they left, walking off as if nothing had happened.

Not once did Blake care to ask about my injury, never once sparing a thought for the pain I was in.

I lowered my head, my limbs too weak to move. I tried a few times, but I couldn’t find the strength to walk.

""Miss, would you like me to contact your husband?"" the nurse asked gently, her voice full of concern.

I watched them disappear down the hallway, and a bitter smile curled on my lips.

""No. We’ll be divorced soon,"" I murmured, my voice barely audible.

A week passed, and still no sign of Blake.

He had taken Kendall to New York, leaving me behind in this empty villa.

Each day, Kendall sent me photos—pictures of them embracing beneath the Statue of Liberty, kissing amid the bustling crowd of Times Square, kneeling before a sky ablaze with fireworks.

There were too many to count.

The final night before the five-year mark, I hid beneath the covers, alone in the vast emptiness of the villa.

I flipped through the photos, my hands trembling, each image a sharp reminder of the love I would never have.

By the time I reached the last one, my tears fell uncontrollably, slipping through my fingers like sand.

That night, I finally pulled away the light that had once warmed me, casting me into a cold, unfamiliar darkness.

When the divorce agreement took effect, Blake still hadn’t returned home.

I never got the chance to say a proper goodbye.

With a heavy heart, I packed up everything that was mine, placing the divorce agreement neatly on the coffee table.

I took one last, lingering glance at the villa that had held me captive for five years, its walls now nothing more than cold memories, before walking away without a single look back.

From that moment on, I would be free.

A free soul, no longer shackled by the chains of anyone or anything.

It was half a month later when Blake called, just as I was holding an invitation from the renowned designer Solomon Jennings.



Chapter 5

For five long years, Blake never let me step beyond the walls of the villa. Trapped in my gilded cage, I poured my soul into sketching jewelry designs.

During that time, I collaborated on several occasions with Solomon’s studio, and a few pieces from their latest collection bore my signature touch.

Over the years, Solomon had extended countless invitations for me to join his team, but bound by my contract with Blake, I had always declined.

This time, when the offer came, I finally said yes.

The phone rang not long after, and Blake’s icy tone cut through the line.

""Where are you?""

His voice dripped with entitlement. ""Didn’t I make myself clear? I don’t want my wife parading around for everyone to see. Get back here. Kendall is moving into the villa, and you’re supposed to take care of her.""

Take care of her?

I let out a dry laugh and replied as coolly as ever. ""What’s the matter, Blake? Did Kendall lose her hands or her legs? Or is the great Wilson family suddenly too poor to hire a nanny?""

Blake’s fury crackled through the phone like a storm.

""Who gave you the right to talk to me like that?"" His voice was sharp, brimming with contempt. ""Get back here right now, or I’ll freeze your card! Let’s see how long you last in Seattle without me!""

The call ended abruptly, his anger lingering in the silence.

I couldn’t help but chuckle as I tossed my phone onto the couch. His threats, once suffocating, now felt almost laughable.

Riker Brown, my brother and confidant, picked up my phone and glanced at the screen, his frown deepening. ""Have you made up your mind? Once the divorce is final, there’s no turning back.""

He paused, his tone softening. ""Are you really okay with that?""

Over the years, Riker had been my rock, the only person I could trust with the truths I didn’t dare admit to anyone else. Even the hidden feelings I had buried deep in my heart were no secret to him.

Just then, my phone buzzed with a new message. I hesitated before checking it, and there it was, another photo from Kendall.

In the picture, Blake was on one knee, his smile radiant as he slipped a dazzling diamond ring onto Kendall’s finger. Her laughter, frozen in time, seemed to mock me.

The image hit me like a punch to the chest. My heart, long numbed by years of neglect, suddenly felt as if it had been shattered into a thousand pieces. Each jagged edge tore at me, making every breath feel like a struggle.

For five long years, I had waited—waited for something I never dared to hope for. Yet, with nothing more than a flick of her finger, she had it all handed to her on a silver platter.

“At peace with it,” I murmured, shutting off my phone as a hollow smile tugged at my lips.

This was nothing new. I had anticipated it all along.

From the very beginning, I had known what this was, a transaction, plain and simple.

Time and money exchanged like currency, and with the contract finally reaching its end, it was my turn to walk away.

The next day, Blake called relentlessly. I watched his name flash on my screen over and over but didn’t answer even once.

When his calls were met with silence, his anger came through in a text instead.

\[If you don’t come back now, then don’t bother coming back at all!\]

I almost laughed at the irony. My fingers hovered over the keyboard, ready to remind him to read the divorce agreement waiting neatly on the coffee table, but before I could send anything, another message appeared, this time from Kendall.

The photo loaded slowly, but the moment it appeared, it was like a slap to the face. There she was, draped in a pristine white wedding dress, her radiant smile glowing as she leaned into Blake’s arms. The pictures kept coming, photo after photo of their apparent happiness.

Wedding photos.

My chest tightened, but I forced myself to scroll through the messages that followed.

\[We’re already preparing for the wedding. So when is the intruder planning to leave the Wilson family?\]

\[If you behave yourself, maybe I’ll even let you attend the wedding. Wouldn’t that be fun?\]

\[Jealous, aren’t you? He never even thought about planning a wedding for you. But the moment I mentioned it, he couldn’t wait to make it happen.\]

Each word cut deeper than the last. My hands trembled, and with every message, the pain buried deep within me surfaced like a tidal wave. I couldn’t take any more.

Without reading the rest, I blocked her number and set the phone down.

After doing that, I opened my email and finally replied to Solomon, confirming the time to join his studio.

October 23rd.

The day Blake and Kendall tied the knot.

He embraced his happiness with open arms, while I silently vowed to vanish from his world forever.

At the venue, Kendall was glowing, her laughter echoing through the room as she meticulously chose her reception dress. She radiated joy, a picture-perfect bride basking in the love and adoration surrounding her.

From across the room, Blake watched her. This was everything he had ever dreamed of, standing on the brink of marrying the woman he had always claimed to love. Yet, beneath the surface, a shadow lingered. His heart felt heavy, veiled by an unshakable mist that left him restless as if a piece of the puzzle was missing.

Unable to resist, he pulled out his phone and opened the chat with me. The screen lit up with his last message from the day before, a sharp warning that if I didn’t return home, he’d cut me off financially.

There was no reply. Just silence.

For five years, I had been the perfect picture of compliance, never once defying his authority.

In all that time, I had never stayed away this long.

Irritated, Blake fired off another message.

\[What childish tantrum are you throwing now?\]

But as he hit send, a glaring red exclamation mark greeted him. The message hadn’t gone through.

I had blocked him.

Fury surged through him as he tried calling me, only to be met with the cold realization that his calls had been blocked as well.

What game was she playing?

Without wasting a second, he grabbed his phone and barked orders to his assistant.

“Freeze Laura’s supplementary card immediately and restrict all her spending!”

Without access to money, he thought, she and her brother wouldn’t last long in this city. They’d come crawling back.

There was a brief silence on the other end before the assistant hesitantly spoke.

“Sir, for the past five years, she hasn’t used her supplementary card even once.”

We are so slow in the morning we drink coffee, eat and then get ready. We have a 2yo and she eats with us. But the problem is by the time I do daycare drop offs and get to the train station it's super late. Daycare is about 10-15mins away drive (theoretically), but it's on the way to the train station with a very large parking structure. But by the time I drop her off, drive and park it's like 40mins all up. 

I'm not sure what to do. There's a closure daycare but I don't like ot that much and she's super happy at her current one. Plus the train station near us has a small parking lot that fills up super early. I guess I could get a seat for my bike and ride her there and to the station but not great in bad weather. And it probably will take just as long. It's about a 15min bike ride to the nearest train station so probably 15mins to get to daycare, plus drop off time then maybe 10mins to ride to train station then time to lock up the bike. Anyways, I don't want to change her daycare. 

The only option is to get out the door quicker. It's hard as I'm already doing minimal makeup. And the LO wants to copy everything I do so she grabs at all my lotions/makeup brushes. 

I don't think putting her to sleep in the clothes she'll wear the next day will save too much time. If only she wouldn't always take her shoes off and stop pulling out her hair tie that would help. 

Anyways, more of a rant I guess, next week I'm starting a new job with a longer commute so I need to hurry up. My husband can't do drop offs at the moment but hoping that changes soon. No other family here.",1,1749170702.0,workingmumsau,2,1.0,False

I’ve been working on a mix of creative and tech projects outside my 9–5 — stuff like:

* A coffee cart I bring to pop-ups (I’d love to open a creative café one day)
* Writing a feature-length psychological romance set in fine dining while filming short films for filmmaking practice
* Building small tools and apps on the side (my last one was a home-cook delivery platform I sold, now I’m playing with AI + personal data ideas)

It’s all been connecting for me, I’m building toward something bigger. But it’s hard finding people in the city who are also trying to make bold, creative things while working jobs and balancing life.

So I’m wondering where do people like that meet in Toronto these days? IRL or online — co-working spaces, film nights, Discords, cafés, whatever, just trying to see where that ""third"" place is for people.

I visited my doctor, and all my blood tests, as well as an H. pylori test, came back normal. However, these bloating symptoms are affecting my social life, so I’m considering visiting a gastroenterologist for further advice.

Before I get started, here are some facts about me when I started:

29 Year Old Male
5’11’’
372 lbs. 
Total Daily Energy Expenditure: 3200 calories

My diet before starting Sema was completely out of control. I was having XL iced coffee and donut for breakfast, pizza slice and XL soda for lunch, and double portion meals for dinner. 4,000+ calories a day easy. 

Doctor saw that I had elevated liver enzymes, and said I was in the first stage of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease. 

Doctor then started me on .25 mg Semaglutide 2 weeks ago. Started counting calories. I immediately had a response to the medicine within hours of taking my first shot. Appetite has been completely suppressed, and I have been eating roughly 1,000-1,200 calories a day every day. 

Supplements I am taking:
Vitamin B12 daily
Garlic
NAD+
Milk Thistle
Dandelion Root

I have had a rapid weight loss for sure. My clothes already feel more loose. I attribute a lot of my weight loss to decreased inflammation and having less water weight.

Just wanted to give a quick update. In the end, my friend and my girlfriend didn’t end up kissing in the musical—so that part resolved itself. But things took a weird turn afterward. We found out that my friend had developed feelings for my girlfriend. He ended up writing a whole song about how he didn’t get to kiss her and performed it at a local coffee shop… in front of over a hundred people.

The song made my girlfriend really uncomfortable, especially because it was clearly about her. On top of that, he started acting cold and weird toward me, like I had done something wrong, even though I hadn’t. It’s been awkward and frustrating to deal with, and honestly, pretty disappointing.

Just wanted to share how it all played out. Thanks again for the support and advice.

Hi my fellow potatoes 🥔 

This has a ton of backstory before we get to the current juicy bit so apologies in advance for me monologging.

Me and my friend “Kate” are in our mid-20s and have had a bit of a on and off friendship since high school, we can go from being close to not talking for months. Growing up, finding your feet and not sweating friendships kind of deal.
A bit after COVID we started being better friends, the kind that occasionally got coffee and did some events together as adults but we didn’t have that “talk every day/send memes often” type of friendship. Still it was what I thought was a solid friendship for a grown up even though we have two completely different lifestyles and interests.

Cut to end of 2023 I surprised a lot of people in my life when I eloped with my husband! We planned to still have some form of celebrations for both of our families (they live very far apart and travel isn’t an option for everyone in our lives we’d want there)
I immediately asked for Kate and two other friends “Jane” and “Brooke” to be my “girl squad” at first we were considering staging a ceremony but ended up deciding to do some quick words and make it a party. For some reason Kate took it to heart that I was “demoting her” from a bridesmaid even though I explained they still meant the world to me and I just didn’t want the stress of a ceremony unnecessarily. I chalked it up to her also going through some issues with her boyfriend she’d been with for a while who had stated he wasn’t inserted in “wedding nonsense” even though she was.

Now the only part I can understand being a bit of an A-hole was the “girls day/bachelorette” I said I wanted a surprise but to consider that I travel for work and money was not going to be good for me on the day they planned it. The month beforehand I had also just been majorly injured with two herniated lumbar discs for the second time in less than a year and any movement or standing for long periods of time would be tough.
Despite these parameters she was aware of, she planned a pricey brunch spot, a rage room with sledgehammers, a spa day, a crowded food festival for dinner (that was so busy I didn’t even eat till past 1am when I got home) and a concert for an artist I never heard of followed by going to the club she wanted to go to.
I was struggling. On top of this I had to drive and pick everyone up, drive around the city and drive everyone home (sometimes going all the way out to go back all the way in, I used up a full tank of fuel) 
“Brooke” knew how stressed I was and paid for a lot of my portions and helped administer pain relief and checked in with my neuro deficits (we both work in healthcare so she understood how concerning it is that can’t feel half my foot all the time)  

I. Was. Hurt.
I couldn’t believe that not only was half of it things I wouldn’t ever step foot in but it was all done despite my current physical challenges and financial strain. (Idk if it makes me the A-hole for being so upset but it definitely hurt the friendship a bit)

Random inclusion cause idk where to say it but Brooke also let me know she had a lot going on and cause she couldn’t get a dress and some other things she wasn’t making the wedding. I had zero sweat about it but Kate was mad not only was she just not turning up but she had also been very unresponsive to messages in their chat despite me reiterating Brooke works in a major hospital in a demanding role and she can’t be glued to her phone or have the social battery to reply some weeks.

Then at the wedding celebration I asked for Kate to keep photographs on time ( she has experience in events) and help announce who was needed for photos at that time on the schedule. I didn’t want to be stressed making sure I got photos done with everyone important and it was the only task I asked of her. She did none of it. I ended up spending half the time running around for photos and couldn’t enjoy the night without anxiety that I forgot something.

Now for the most up to date issues!

End of 2024, Kate’s boyfriend decided to propose on their recent trip and she bought her engagement ring sometime after she told me during lunch. I was surprised as not only had she told me he had no interest in marriage he had apparently left her at home one night a few weeks prior and drunkenly called her saying she’s too uptight and he’s going to go cheat on her when she asked him to come home.

Of course I was ecstatic for her!
And she messaged me after a few weeks to be her matron of honour since her coworker was going to be her maid of honour.
She planned for the wedding to be Oct 2026 
The other bridesmaids are her coworkers from her current job and my third “girls crew” friend from my wedding celebration that I’d introduced her to a week before I eloped.
Very quickly it became apparent she had planned a lot including her bachelorette that HAD to include brunch, spa day, high restaurant dinner, a burlesque show and then clubbing.
Oh and she had to have a pink stretch hummer
It was also implied she wasn’t expecting to pay for a portion of it

I was a lil hurt again to see her demands after she “botched” my girls day (in my other friends words) and since the wedding and subsequent other things leading up to it wouldn’t be for over a year and half I figured it was all fresh engaged excitement and I stated I was happy for her and didn’t engage much other than checking the group messages for the next three days

She then messaged me asked why I wasn’t engaging in the group and I reassured I was just on a big work trip (I am an event paramedic for high trauma sport) and dealing with my own marriage after an early miscarriage last 2024 and that since my husband and I would be moving internationally I was already a little stressed at the idea of international travel for her wedding.
She quickly suggested I just attend as a guest and I was a little crestfallen but accepted as I had a weird tugging feeling that’s what she really wanted anyway.

We didn’t talk much after that except for a random morning when she messaged me to say she saw my husband had liked an Instagram post from a girl with a OF account (which I am pro SW and don’t care if people hustle with it) I thought it was really weird she felt the need to tell me about this one post when I had stated before that we are both open about content we engage with and I’m okay with him liking Instagram posts as long as he isn’t buying material. (He also confirmed he wasn’t when I asked him about it) I chose to prioritise peace at that moment and not respond and she didn’t reach out at any point to talk to me about anything.

A week ago she messaged me to say she’s hurt we aren’t talking and I don’t message her.
I told her I don’t want to dismiss her feelings but talking does go both ways and I feel it’s unfair to almost blame me for not reaching out when she isn’t reaching out either.
She proceeded to constantly reiterate that she “doesn’t know why I’m doing this” and shes “so upset and hurt” while I’m trying to still validate that I understand she’s hurt but point out that she hasn’t said anything to me other than the random accusation she’s thrown at my husband.
Shes proceeded to block me on everything.

My husband and my mama think I’ve cut a dead weight and she’s probably been insecure about how quickly I eloped as opposed to what feels like her getting a “shut up ring” after 5 years of waiting 
Thinking it over I realised how often I was the one making efforts in the friendship, driving over an hour for lunch dates that was down the road for her, in the past picking her up from the airport etc
But I also have the pathological people pleaser in me saying maybe I am the A-hole.

I told her that I took my names off the records and I consider myself to be an exmo.  She still calls me Mormon all the time.  She saw me wear pants at work and I told her that’s because most of my wardrobe is dresses and outside of work is where I wear my revealing clothes lol.  She said she thought it was a Mormon thing but I told her it was just because someone gave me their bag of plus size clothing and 95 percent was big ass comfy dresses lol.  I swear around her and when she told me I should marry a rich Mormon man I said hell no I don’t want my marriage to be a dance to try and convert me.

Honestly it doesn’t bother me but I thought it was interesting.  Do you consider yourself culturally Mormon? I still hate the taste of coffee and alcohol but I feel like the rest of me is pretty generic midwestern.  I know people consider themselves culturally Muslim sometimes even if they don’t believe in Islam so it’s not too out of the realm of possibility.  I also know a popular ex Mormon that people still basically call Mormon a lot.  It’s hard for me to say what I consider myself because I think I have a lot of remnants but I also wasn’t allowed at my brother’s temple wedding. ",3,1749169196.0,exmormon,9,1.0,False

We met around a year ago at a summer job we had together and we got along relatively well. He bought me and my coworkers food and coffee often, so of course i had nothing against him. 

He’s a great and well rounded person, very respectful, smart, funny and kind. We have been texting every single day for almost a year straight, and our job was in the downtown area of our city, but we coincidentally live 10 minutes from each other. That being said, we’ve become really close over the last year and we go out to study together all the time, as well as just hang out. 
The thing is, sometimes i think he’s flirting with me but i’m super unsure. He follows a good amount of women who are popular for their attractiveness, which makes me think he would not be attracted to me. However he has told me i am beautiful straight up, and constantly compliments me (even though he’s always been the type of guy to never compliment people). He also always tries to find a way to spend time with me, even if it means that he has to interact with my friends (this is pertinent because he is very shy). 

Overall, i am going to university at a really big school in the fall. I do think i have some sort of romantic feelings for him, but i think that it isn’t intense enough to say anything. I do really like him, but i’m scared to lose a friendship over a feeling that potentially is not even reciprocated.  I’m scared that if i don’t say anything about it, it’ll just become this built up tension between us that he will resent me for. On the other side, i think that if i do tell him and he reciprocates, i’ll feel as though i’m missing out on the opportunity for the cliche “university first year” experience.

Michael walked out of a nearby coffee shop moments later holding a steaming hot cup of the cheapest brew they sold. He thought about sitting at one of the outdoor tables, but he didn’t feel comfortable having his mask off in public for much longer, so he walked into an alley and flew toward another roof instead. Carefully clutching his cup between his teeth. By some miracle, he landed without burning himself or spilling a drop. He sat against the wall bordering the edge and pulled his phone out again while sipping coffee.

“We bring you live to the ongoing jewelry heist where the green eagle has just arrived on the scene.”

Michael nearly choked on his drink. “Are you kidding me?” he said with exasperation. He groaned and put his phone down, letting the scene of a flying man in a green suit fighting two armed robbers play out while focusing on his coffee. “I’ll just have to stay more vigilant,” he sighed.

He sat watching for another hour after the robbery had been thwarted, but nothing was happening. Sighing, he dove back into his mental library while monitoring the news. He focused on improving his speaking and lying, knowing there would be a time soon when he would actually meet one of Raymond’s lackeys.

The pale, rotting apparition of a man appeared in his peripheral vision. Michael blinked a few times, thinking his head was playing tricks on him, but the man was still there whenever he opened his eyes. Finally accepting that this was actually happening, he turned to look at the man again. Recognition flashed across his expression.

“The owner of the mental library power,” he muttered.

The apparition turned towards him and nodded. “My… library.” He looked off in thought for a few moments and turned back to Michael. “Why… can’t… see?”

Michael deactivated the power and continued watching the apparition slowly fade. “What the hell kind of power is this mental library?” he asked, jumping to his feet. A thought came to his mind. *Is the library or is it my power?*

He quickly circled through his powers using each of them, but the only time he saw an apparition was while using the mental library. “Why did the vision of it not show me this?” he asked himself.

“Breaking news!”

He was pulled from his thoughts as he turned to his phone.

“The supervillain, Bloodwake, has appeared on the coastline and is quickly approaching downtown. It is advised that you–”

Michael shut the broadcast off and jumped from the roof, flying toward the coastline. He arrived to find a scene of panic spreading out into the city from a nearby beach as an older man with graying hair stood atop a stationary wave large enough to be considered a tsunami. He wore a black and red wetsuit covering everything but his neck and head. A large humanoid creature with gray skin, shark-like heads, and eyes jumped from the wave, and a scene of carnage unfolded below as they devoured anyone they could get their webbed hands on.

Michael flew toward one of the shark creatures, pursuing a beachgoer like a falling meteor. He activated the hardening power and precognition in addition to his flames. His entire body hardened into a rock-like substance, and he collided with the creature, turning it into a pile of mush. Blood covered him, and the woman he had just saved continued to scream in horror, but he had no time to dwell on it.

He boosted forward, pursuing another shark creature. With a swift twist, using his jets to spin like a top, he delivered a spinning roundhouse kick to the creature’s jaw. An audible crack resounded, and the beast flew back, its lower jaw hanging limply from its face.

The beast charged at him, and Michael delivered a full force right hook to its face. The punch had little effect as the beast continued forward, wrapping Michael with one large hand and bringing him toward its mouth. He let out a panic cry that soon turned to a nervous chuckle as the beast failed to close its broken jaw. He switched out his flame jets, and electricity danced between.

“If you’re hungry!” Michael shouted, and a ball of electric blue sparks condensed in the creature’s maw. He sent it forward, slamming into the creature’s throat.

It roared in pain, dropping Michael and falling back, its limbs spasming. Michael panted and searched the beach for his next target. What sounded like the impact of four meteors echoed out around him. He frantically looked for the cause, and his jaw went slack as he saw them.

Three members of the Crimson Accord, the world’s premier superhero team, landed on the beach, accompanied by Wonder Boy.

“About time,” a giant of a man said, cracking his neck. He was dressed in camo pants and a black tank top, and he had a camo bandana with two slots cut out for his eyes, covering the top half of his face.

\*Cannon! Super strength, super durability, and–\*The man pulled two high-caliber pistols that were closer to a small cannon from holsters attached to his belt—a *large amount of firepower.*

He flipped two selectors on his guns to a setting showing a skull and crossbones. He pointed the weapons at two shark creatures with a squeeze of the trigger, followed by a deafening bang. Michael couldn’t even blink before a bowling ball-sized hole opened in each creature.

“Oh yeah! This is going to be fun!” Cannon shouted with a laugh, dashing into the fray.

A woman clad in a scarlet dress and domino mask dashed into the fray, slicing a shark to ribbons with a blade that flowed like a piece of fabric.

*The Red Seamstresses! Turns any fabric into a blade sharper than a razor.*

Finally, a man with two large metal gauntlets dressed in a simple collared shirt and jeans walked forward. Light glinted off a pair of high-tech goggles that seemed to be zooming in on Bloodwake. He raised his hands into the air. Each gauntlet let out a puff of steam as several steel tubes emerged.

He checked his aim one last time. “Fire.” Several beams of pure plasma shot from streaking straight toward Bloodwake, forcing him to jump from atop the wave.”

*Torque! Superintelligence! I heard he made the first multi-fist prototype when he was only 12!*

Bloodwake elegantly landed on the ground with a bow. The sand beneath his feet suddenly turned to liquid but stilled before he was sucked in. “I see what you would call for help, Wonder boy,” he said, checking his nails. “I wouldn’t want to fight someone my power doesn’t work against either.”

Wonder Boy smiled and stood from a kneeling position. “Spot on, but let’s see if you can keep control while under pressure.”

“Hmph,” Bloodwake snorted. Side-stepping a ribbon slashing toward him. “You underestimate me. It will be your last mistake.” His limbs boggled out and turned gray as a large fin sprouted from his back, and his eyes turned black and beady, a large maw opening beneath them.

“Here we go!” Cannon roared, changing the setting on his guns to the image of a circle of stars.

He pulled the trigger repeatedly, but with a wave of his hand, a line of water shot out from the giant wave, intercepting the projectiles. The Red Seamstresses dashed in next, swinging her flowing blade. Bloodwake looked with an unimpressed expression. He caught the ribbon in his massive hand, letting it slice open. He used the blood pouring from the wound to surround the ribbon and used it to yank the seamstress forward before she knew what was happening. He opened his maw wide, but just as he was about to chomp down on the woman, he was forced to jump back as another wave of plasma shot past him.

“Think again!” Torque yelled.

Bloodwake grunted and spared a fleeting glance at the sand beneath him. He seized control when Wonder Boy finished liquifying it and surrounded the Seamstress’s head before he could harden it again. “Die!” he said in a far deeper, grinding voice. “Raahg!” He yelled as a streak of red and black slammed into him and he lost control of the liquified sand, causing it to fall away.

The Seamstress scrambled back as Michael flew around the shark man, delivering a flurry of strikes while staying out of the creature’s grasp.

*Just a little more!* He thought, watching his precognition of Bloodwake as it developed and changed with his attacks. *There!* He flew into the sky at full speed and watched as, moments later, two cannonball-sized bullets slammed into the shark man, knocking him back and sending blood and teeth flying.

Several beams of plasma shot through his legs next, causing him to collapse to the ground with a grunt of pain.

*And good night!* Michael fell from his position high in the sky and slammed his heel into the shark man’s head, knocking him unconscious.

The massive wave moved, but soon stopped again as Wonder Boy solidified it.

Cannon walked forward, rubbing the back of his head. “Ugh, we are going to need to get someone who can control water out here to fix this,” He turned toward Michael. “Thanks for the assist. You saved our ass.”

We work in the same field but different parts of it, he’s a lawyer and his job is pretty demanding (working constantly). Anyways I attended work related training where he was assisting and sent him an email after and we exchanged numbers and began texting.

We would text literally every day for almost 2 months straight up until last week. Normally he was really good at responding and advising me that he will do his best to get back to me but he’s in court etc. 
There was a time as well where I underwent surgery and was drugged up and couldn’t respond.
He told me he was in a long term relationship for almost 10 years that ended last year, and since had just been very focused on his career. I believe him just based on his “game” lack of social media etc. It seems very much like he was in this relationship for a long time and hasn’t really played the field since.

So since talking we have only met up once for coffee while he was between court cases and talked on the phone once. We were suppose to hangout two prior occasions but he cancelled both because of work and I haven’t bothered to try and arrange them again because it’s always me asking to hangout. He also hasn’t asked me to hangout on any weekend. 

Last week instead of replying to my messages he just liked them and didn’t respond. Then I messaged him a few days later asking how he was doing and he said he was really sick, apologized but then he did the same thing again to me on Monday. I didn’t bother double texting again and he hasn’t said anything since.

I don’t think there’s someone else and he’s been very transparent in advising that he likes me, finds me attractive and wants to take it slow but later date. I really liked our connection and banter but the lack of effort is really making me think he’s not interested.

Sarah's POV



""Lucian, I've been married to you for three years, and you've never touched me... I sacrificed myself for you and your lover, I gave up the marriage that the moon goddess bestowed upon me... After tonight, you can go find her! Now, consider it as compensation for all these years, for my feelings towards you, okay?”



After saying these words, I lowered my head and kissed the man in front of me.



With my inexperienced lips, I blindly sought his tightly closed lips.



My hands explored his almost perfect body.



I didn't know if what I was doing was right or wrong, but I could feel his lower body gradually hardening, the tight trousers unable to contain its movements as it rubbed against my lower abdomen.



""Sarah Wynn, how dare you!"" Lucian gritted his teeth, his exquisite and handsome face filled with anger.



He wanted to push me away, but the aphrodisiac laced with wolfsbane, along with my body, completely triggered his werewolf instincts.



Soon, his rationality was completely gone.



Lucian's eyes were bloodshot. He roared, opened his mouth wide, and viciously bit into my neck.



I endured the pain as he roughly tore off my clothes, dress, bra, panties... Soon, I was left completely exposed in front of him.



His hands roughly fondled my breasts, his mouth constantly licking my neck.



His swollen lower body ignored all restraints and directly thrust towards my private area.



There was no foreplay, only my screams and his deep growls.



...



My name is Sarah Wynn, originally the designated heir of the neighboring Silvermoon Pack. My genes are excellent, and my abilities are outstanding, but due to my family's business failure, I was forced out by another pack and had to flee to Twilight Vale.



Arriving in Twilight Vale, penniless and struggling to survive, I was fortunate enough to be saved by the old alpha of the Shadowmoon Pack.



He bluntly stated that my genes were excellent and very suitable to marry his son, Lucian Graves, who is also the alpha of the Shadowmoon Pack.



Lucian's looks and talents are exceptional, and I fell deeply in love with him after our first meeting, so I willingly agreed to the old alpha's request.



With the help of the old alpha of the Shadowmoon Pack, I quickly married Lucian.



At that time, I was overjoyed, eagerly anticipating the arrival of our wedding night, ready to give myself completely to him.



I saw him enter our bridal chamber and expressed my love to him: ""Respected Moon Goddess above, I, Sarah Wynn, am willing to swear here that I will accompany you for the rest of my life, be your Luna, and manage Shadowmoon Pack with you without any regrets.""



But my loyalty was met with disgust from Lucian.



""Sarah, I will not touch you, even if we swear in front of the Moon Goddess. But you should know, the person I want to marry is Evelyn, not you! Only she is my destined mate, only she is qualified to be my Luna, you are not worthy!""



My heart sank to the bottom of the valley.



I knew Lucian had no obligation to like me, let alone love me.



But I still naively held onto hope, thinking that one day I could warm this man's heart, after all, our marriage was blessed by the Moon Goddess.



In the three years of marriage, I worked diligently to be a good wife.



Every night, I cooked personally, just so he could come back to eat a hot meal.



No matter how late it was, I always waited for him to come home before I could relax.



If he got drunk from socializing, I would take care of him attentively, never asking for help.



If he got sick or had a minor injury, I would worry more than anyone else.



Every winter, I would turn on the heating early for him, prepare hot water, get up early in the morning to warm his clothes, just hoping he wouldn't feel cold...



But after three years, he still treated me with disdain, let alone mating, he didn't even spare me a glance.



I slowly fell into despair, looking at my hands covered in calluses, laughing at myself inwardly.



I used to be the designated heir of the noble Silvermoon Pack, but now I looked more like a weathered middle-aged woman.



So, I drugged him.



I knew my methods were despicable.



But I have loved for too long, suffered too much!



At this moment, I just seek a little comfort.



...



I endured his assault on my body; his eyes were bloodshot, clearly caught in an extreme frenzy of excitement.



But in his bloodshot eyes, I saw a hint of reason and rage.



His Alpha constitution actually allowed him to resist the erosion of the wolfsbane?



""Sarah, how dare you offend the Alpha, I, in the name of the Alpha of Shadowmoon Pack, strip you of your Luna status and expel you from Shadowmoon Pack. From today onwards, you will forever be a lowly, despicable, physically weak Omega, never to rise again!""



**Chapter 2 Severed Relationship**



As he spoke, his eyes turned deep red again, and reason left him.



The impact from below surged once again.



But the curse of Alpha's degradation followed closely!



It felt as if my soul was being torn apart in an instant, excruciating pain spreading from my head to my whole body. I felt like my head and body were shattering into countless pieces, the agony even surpassing the pain of being violated below.



I couldn't help but scream out loud.



And my wolf, Sylva, also fell into a deep sleep, no longer able to respond to my calls.



Lucian's hips began to twitch frantically, the rushing sweat and wild gasps intertwining in the dark night, the intense pounding like a drumbeat echoing in my ears, drowning out my cries completely.



Under the double agony, I passed out.



...



When I woke up again, it was already light outside.



I endured the intense pain from below and slowly got up from the bed.



Memories flooded back, and I began to tremble all over.



Last night, it seemed like Lucian's Alpha energy was inexhaustible. He would always release with a low growl, then shortly after, start another round of movements.



Again and again.



I was caught between agony and clarity, constantly switching back and forth.



It felt like being in hell.



Lucian was still lying on the bed, deeply asleep, surrounded by a mess and torn clothing.



This powerful alpha indeed had an extremely handsome face and a perfect physique, lying naked on the bed, tempting every woman to crawl into his embrace and enjoy his favor.



Not only that, his strength and charisma were enough to conquer every female werewolf on the continent.



But in my heart, there was no longer any emotion.



Hatred, love, all vanished.



I just looked at him indifferently and said softly, ""Lucian, I set you free. From now on, we go our separate ways, with no ties between us!""



After speaking, I quickly packed my things, turned around, and left without a hint of nostalgia.



As I walked out of the villa of the Shadowmoon Pack, my heart was filled with bitterness and sorrow.



I had loved Lucian for seven whole years.



Since I arrived in City B, his strength had completely conquered me.



When the old alpha of the Shadowmoon Pack asked me to marry him, I was overjoyed.



But he always thought that I married him because my family was in decline, it was a marriage of convenience between two packs, and I held the key to power.



So he hated me, and ever since I married him and became the Luna of the Shadowmoon Pack, he has been hating me every moment.



He treated me coldly in every way, humiliated me, and because I loved him, I endured it all and tried my best to please him.



However, love is just love.



Until the day before yesterday, on his birthday, I went out to buy him a gift, but got into a car accident. When I limped back home with the gift, he stepped on it and coldly asked me why I didn't cook, as he had to hurry to see Evelyn, who had caught a cold.



At that moment, I finally understood that all of this was just my wishful thinking!



The heart of this high and mighty alpha is something I could never warm up to in my entire life.



He belongs to another woman.



I am tired, and I have completely given up!



I stood on the main road, facing the direction of the Shadowmoon Pack's mansion, knelt down on the ground, facing the moon above, and devoutly prayed: ""Beautiful moon goddess above, humble werewolf Sarah is willing to give up everything, sever the Luna bond with Shadowmoon Pack's alpha Lucian, and never have any contact again, even in death.""



After saying that, I stood up, and without looking back, I left.



**Chapter 3 I Will Make You Pay**



Lucian's POV



When I woke up, I felt an unusually throbbing headache, and it took me a while to slowly sit up in the bed.



The room was a mess, with a small bright red stain on the snow-white sheets, and torn fabric everywhere.



Every detail was telling me about the intense battle last night.



At that moment, the first thought that flashed through my mind was to strangle Sarah!



I, the esteemed alpha of Shadowmoon Pack, known for my cunning in the werewolf world, had never been outsmarted or taken advantage of by anyone.



Never did I expect to fall for the first time to that despicable woman, no, now she should be called the despicable Omega!



Daring to poison the noble alpha, even my wolf Lorne couldn't tolerate it. It told me that that woman must pay the price.



The anger and frustration in my heart lingered, and as I scanned the room, I didn't see the woman's figure. In the corner of my eye, I noticed the open closet, already devoid of Sarah's clothes.



Furrowing my brows, I realized her suitcase was also missing.



My pupils constricted, and my mood suddenly turned dark.



First, she poisoned me with wolfs bane, then mated with me, and now she left without a word... The tricks were getting more and more elaborate.



I didn't believe for a second that Sarah would be willing to divorce me.



How could this woman possibly give up the power and wealth she had always longed for?



However, everything she did last night had crossed my bottom line. She clearly didn't respect me, the alpha!



Thinking she could just leave and walk away? I will settle all these accounts with her one by one.



I got up abruptly, took out a new set of clothes from the closet, and with a menacing aura, I went downstairs, questioning the butler, ""Have you seen Sarah?""



The butler, Silas, hesitated for a moment before replying, ""Alpha, Luna left early in the morning with her luggage...""



Upon hearing this, I was stunned...



That woman... she really left?



Sarah's POV



Six years later.



Star Pack, Werewolf Herbal Research Center.



At noon, I sat in the Research Center's lounge, leisurely sipping on coffee, enjoying a moment of peace in my busy life.



Just as I took the first sip, my assistant Clara rushed out and interrupted, ""Professor Wynn, Professor Clarke is looking for you. He wants you to go to his office."" 



I was so startled that I accidentally burned my mouth with the coffee, but I didn't have time to worry about that as I urgently asked:



""He said something? It's not... the research results, being eaten by those two little troublemakers at home, right?""



""Obviously.""



Clara responded, and I could see a hint of sympathy in her eyes.



It's understandable. Ever since I joined the Werewolf Herbal Research Center, I have relied on my strong ability to get things done and my unparalleled research skills to become the second in command at the Research Center.



Most people in the herbal medicine world have to address me as Professor Wynn when they see me, let alone scold me.



But every time, I have to take the blame for those two troublemaking kids at home!



Seeing me a little dejected, Clara instinctively comforted me, ""You've been locked in the research room for three days in a row again, Elias and Asher are worried about your health, and they've been causing trouble at the Research Center every day... I can see Professor Clarke's hairline receding further.""



I was about to say something, but Clara continued to comfort me, ""Oh, by the way, Professor Clarke has already checked Elias and Asher, those herbs are just for enhancing physical fitness, there's no problem. But he said Elias and Asher hacked his computer, and he can't fix it.""



After hearing these words, I felt a headache coming on, but also found it somewhat amusing.



Six years ago, after leaving the Shadowmoon Pack, I had intended to further my studies and start over, but unexpectedly found out that I was pregnant.



At the time, I had also struggled with whether to terminate the pregnancy; after all, I had sworn under the moon goddess to cut off all ties with him.



But when I got to the hospital, I hesitated.



After all, it was my own flesh, and in the end, I chose to keep the child!



I gave birth to triplets, two boys and a girl.



After being demoted by Lucian, my physical fitness was not as good as before. During childbirth, the girl suffered from lack of oxygen and passed away, leaving behind only two precious sons, Elias and Asher.



After the death of my daughter, I was devastated and decided to leave that sad place, finally leaving the city with my sons and coming to the northernmost Star Pack, determined to start anew in this new place.



Thinking of those two incredibly intelligent and handsome little werewolves, my heart was filled with extreme happiness.



But suddenly remembering that I had to take the blame for them, I instantly felt deflated...



**Chapter 4 Two Little Devils**



After saying goodbye to Clara, I quickly went to Professor Clarke's office at the Research Center.



As soon as I walked in, I saw my two little devils lying on the sofa in Professor Clarke's office, swinging their legs.



Seeing me enter, their eyes quickly locked onto me, and they immediately slid off the sofa and ran towards me, ""Mommy, you're finally out! I thought you were planning to live in the Research Center from now on!""



""Mommy, you've worked hard. Are you tired? Sit down, I'll give you a back massage...""



With that, the two little devils, one on each side, pulled me and sat me down on the sofa without a care in the world.



Looking at the two thoughtful little ones, I suddenly felt that it was worth getting scolded!



""You two are behaving well now, but where was this attitude when you were messing with my computer?""



Seeing this scene from behind his desk, Professor Clarke was furious.



Elias stood boldly in front of me, ""It's all because of you, Master! You always make Mommy work overtime. Look, she's almost malnourished!""



""Yeah, Mommy's health has always been badly. How can you make her work day and night like this?""



Asher chimed in from the side, actively squeezing my shoulder with his small hand.



Professor Clarke chuckled, ""It's only you two who protect her like this! Everyone at this Research Center has gone through the same thing.""



I smiled and quickly stood up with the two little devils to apologize to Professor Clarke, ""Brother, I'm sorry, it's my fault for not disciplining them properly. Elias, Asher, apologize to Brother quickly.""



Elias and Asher obediently bowed to Brother and said in unison, ""Brother, we're sorry!""



I saw Professor Clarke's mouth twitch, and he no longer paid attention to Elias and Asher's antics, turning to me and asking, ""How is the research progressing this time?""



I couldn't help but smile, ""It's going smoothly. The data will be sent to your computer later.""



Thinking of the reason I came here, I paused and asked, ""Has the computer been restored?""



Professor Clarke touched his already balding head anxiously, ""It's been an hour and it still hasn't been restored.""



I sighed helplessly, patted Elias's soft little hand, ""Go, restore Brother's computer to its original state, no messing around. What if important data is really lost? what will we do?""



Elias immediately responded in a childish voice, ""No way, I always make sure to back up everything carefully and have multiple layers of protection. There's no way it could be lost!""



Although he said that, he obediently moved over to Professor Clarke's side and began to restore the computer.



The little guy's fingers flew across the keyboard, typing out a series of code...



A few minutes later, the computer restarted and returned to its original state.



I watched from the side, amazed at the genius abilities of my sons.



Elias was very interested in programming and had already become a little hacker. He also had a natural talent for mechanical engineering and had made many unique inventions.



Asher, on the other hand, was very interested in medical knowledge. At a young age, he had already mastered various medical knowledge and could identify thousands of werewolf herbs. He showed a unique talent in the field of medicine and was particularly keen in investments.



The key point was that these two little guys were also very good-looking and had a calm and lively personality.



I couldn't help but sigh, they truly lived up to Lucian's genes, they were truly the cream of the crop.



After letting go of these two little guys, I stood up and apologized to Professor Clarke, ""I'm sorry, brother, the little ones have caused you trouble again, please don't be upset.""



In fact, this brother of mine loved Elias and Asher even more than I did, to the point where he couldn't bear to scold them every time they made a mistake. He would only call me to his office to scold me.



So I quickly apologized, as the saying goes, don't hit a smiling face. I hope my brother can understand me, I can't always be the scapegoat, especially since every time he scolds me, it goes on for half a day and I can't take it.



Professor Clarke saw through my thoughts and laughed, ""Haha, don't worry, this time I'm not going to scold you, I have a task for you! A new batch of werewolf herbs has been discovered in Twilight Vale, which will be very helpful for our research. I hope you can establish a Research Center in Twilight Vale and quickly conduct experiments on these herbs! However, I have a lot of work on my plate at the moment and can't free myself up, so I've decided to send you back!""



**Chapter 5 Back To Twilight Vale**



Return to Twilight Vale?



To be honest, after leaving that place six years ago, I never thought about going back!



After all, the territory where the Shadowmoon Pack is located is filled with my past tragedies.



And I have developed feelings for this place where I grew up with two little ones.



""Senior Brother, I...""



All I could think of was reluctance, and my mouth instinctively wanted to refuse.



Professor Clarke saw my concerns and comforted me, ""Junior Sister, I know you don't want to go back, but I still hope you will consider it carefully... Over the years, we have been researching various werewolf herbs together to prevent accidents like the one that happened to our teacher from happening again. 



We are dedicated to improving werewolf herbs to make our werewolf clan stronger, right? And Twilight Vale has a suitable environment, growing various werewolf herbs, which naturally advantages our experiments. So... that's why I suggest you go back! With your abilities, you will surely achieve great things in the future. Moreover, you have already undergone a great transformation now, even if you encounter anything or anyone again, you should be able to handle it well, right?""



After listening to Professor Clarke's words, I fell into contemplation.



Our teacher, Professor Gu Yan, was originally an authority in the field of werewolf herbs, but he died because he mistakenly consumed a highly toxic wolf poison herb.



Because there were so many types of wolf poison herbs, and even new types would appear, our research was to thoroughly study the types and effects of these werewolf herbs, which was our responsibility.



I sighed, it seemed that I had to go back.



Professor Clarke was right, over the years, I had undergone a huge change, excellent experimental qualities and scientific literacy allowed me to face any difficulties calmly and solve them better, without fear.



And, six years had passed, that noble alpha... maybe he had already sworn in front of the Moon Goddess with his lover, becoming mates, and maybe even had little werewolves.



What was there to be afraid of?



Thinking of this, I took a deep breath and nodded firmly, ""Alright, Senior Brother, I'll listen to you, I'll go to Twilight Vale.""



At worst, I just had to hide my Omega scent, so that Alpha wouldn't even bother with a weak Omega.



Professor Clarke laughed heartily and patted my shoulder, ""It's great that you figured it out so quickly! Don't worry, this time when you go back, I will make sure Clara accompanies you, and I will also send a professional team to assist you.""



""That's fantastic, thank you, Professor!""



As I was handing over the experiment still in progress to Professor Clarke, my eyes caught sight of the two little rascals excitedly discussing something.



My heart skipped a beat, realizing this could be trouble.



Oh no, are those two little troublemakers up to something again?



...



Two days later, I landed at Twilight Vale Airport with my two precious sons.



Before I could even lead Elias and Asher out of the airport, Asher suddenly tugged at my skirt and said pitifully, ""Mommy, I need to go to the bathroom, I really need to go.""



I couldn't help but smile, ruffle Asher's hair, and say, ""Alright, alright, I'll take you...""



Asher shivered and his eyebrows furrowed as he said, ""Mommy, stop rubbing, I'm going to wet my pants!""



I couldn't help but chuckle and quickly took them to the restroom.



Watching them hold hands and walk into the restroom, I stood at the door, checking our luggage and sending a quick message to Professor Clarke.



Suddenly, a familiar voice seemed to casually enter my ears.



""You bunch! So many people, and you can't even watch a six-year-old child. It's a waste of your talents. Believe me, I will use the curse of the Shadowmoon Pack to punish you, demoting you to omega.""



My finger froze on the phone.



After six years, hearing that voice again, there was no sense of unfamiliarity, just a deep sense of familiarity.



I couldn't help but look up and saw the tall figure of a man, captivated by his presence.



He stood not far away, his tall figure wrapped in a black suit, the formal attire making his figure even more alluring, exuding a noble aura that made him stand out in the crowd.



From my angle, I could see his perfect profile.



Those features, like a masterpiece carefully crafted by God, flawless and so beautiful that even the sun and moon would pale in comparison.



Lucian Graves!!!



**Chapter 6 Familiar Figure**



I never expected that on my first day back, I would encounter this man.



Emotions that had been sealed for years suddenly surged, but quickly returned to silence.



My heart quickly calmed down, for me now, he was just a handsome stranger.



I consciously restrained my breath, making sure he wouldn't notice me around him.



Finally, the two little ones who went to the bathroom came out, calling out to me in a cute voice, ""Mommy, we're ready!""



I snapped back to reality, my heart almost stopping in fear.



In my mind, a thought emerged: hurry and leave, don't let Elias and Asher meet that man.



After all, those two faces were almost identical to his!



I was afraid that a single glance would give us away!



I didn't want anything to do with that man anymore!



In a panic, I quickly responded, ""Ready? Let's go quickly, don't keep Aunt waiting too long.""



Without waiting for the little ones to respond, I hurriedly dragged my suitcase and left in a rush in high heels.



Lucian's POV



These idiots really make me furious!



I couldn't help but scold my subordinates, they were a bunch of no use people.



This morning, my daughter inexplicably ran away from home, leaving me only a note saying she had left.



From morning till now, I have been leading our Shadowmoon Pack werewolves in a thorough search of the entire Twilight Vale.



At this moment, we reached the airport, but found nothing.



I couldn't understand; they were a group of strong, sharp-eared betas, yet they couldn't even watch over a six-year-old child.



At that moment, a voice that was very familiar to my soul caught my attention.



""Ready? Let's go quickly, don't keep Aunt waiting too long.""



This voice was too familiar, it resonated deeply with my memories.



I hesitated, could it be that woman? But because the voice was too soft, I couldn't be sure, nor could I locate the source of the voice.



Uncertain, I asked my wolf Lorne, ""Is it her?""



Lorne shook his head, saying, ""Not sure, I don't sense the familiar aura.""



Really?



I was half skeptical, but my heart still unwillingly scanned around.



Even in the crowd, I only caught a very familiar figure.



It was Sarah - !!!



Is it her?



Is it the Omega I punished?



Has she come back again??? 



Without hesitation, I immediately started chasing after her, but the figure had already merged into the crowd and disappeared.



I couldn't help but furrow my brow, the anger in my heart rising instead of subsiding. After so many years, I still couldn't forget the night she drugged me with wolfbane-laced aphrodisiac, only to disappear the next day.



When I finally found her trace in the hospital, I was surprised to find out that she was pregnant with my child and even decided to keep it.



As someone who had never had children, I still wanted to take my child back. After all, Shadowmoon Pack had no heir yet, which was a headache for my father and all the elders of Shadowmoon Pack.



However, I lost track of her again shortly after. When I was clueless, my wolf Lorne came up with an idea - to wait until she gave birth, as we could find her at the werewolf hospital then.



I thought it made sense and decided to wait like that.



And so, I calculated when she would give birth.



During that time, I searched through all the hospitals in Twilight Vale, only to find a nearly dying infant girl in the last one.



I never expected that this woman would be so heartless to abandon a sickly daughter she gave birth to. She could have sought my help, and with my assistance, the child could have been born healthy and grown up to be a strong heir of Shadowmoon Pack.



Just to sever ties with me, she abandoned her own daughter's life like this?



I was furious and vowed to turn Twilight Vale upside down. However, this woman, along with the doctor who helped her deliver, had all left Twilight Vale.



Luckily, my wolf Lorne informed me that my daughter could still be saved.



So, I used the power of Shadowmoon Pack to revive the girl and let her grow up healthily to the age of six. I named her Aurie Graves, hoping she wouldn't be as ruthless and decisive as her mother.



But because she almost died at birth, Aurie was left with disabilities, all because of that heartless woman.



Now, Aurie is the designated heir of Shadowmoon Pack alpha, and she is destined to lead the entire Shadowmoon Pack.



Yet today, I saw that heartless woman again, who had left so resolutely and heartlessly abandoned her child!



Today, she returned here again, not knowing what her purpose was this time.



I furrowed my brow, a memory of the look that woman gave me that night flashed through my mind, a hint of malice in her eyes.



No matter what her purpose is, I don't want my Aurie to have any connection with that woman.

my older sister (mid-20s) lost her very best friend suddenly last year. they were incredibly close, always hanging out, texting constantly, worked near each other so would spend lunch and evenings together. they met four years ago (totally randomly too, in a line at a coffee shop) when i was moving away for college and i was so glad that she had met her person. she has other friends, having always been so popular and sociable, but this friendship was so special.

when her friend passed, it was of course shocking and painful, completely out of the blue. i moved home for a few months just to help her adjust, if that’s even the right word. i know “adjusting” to that kind of loss isn’t really possible. i’m always trying to read on up things so i can be supportive and present in the best way possible. and i know this whole thing isn’t about me at all, but it’s been hard seeing how much she’s changed since.

she’s become unusually mean and cold, in ways that seem to get worse over time. she never used to be like that. but we keep finding ourselves in instances where she upsets me and i just have to deal with it, no acknowledgment, no apology, nothing.

i try not to take it personally, but i walk on eggshells around her now. it’s becoming especially difficult because she used to be that friend for me, someone i could confide in about anything. i feel like i can’t bring anything to her now, any news or feelings, positive or negative.

i totally understand that grief isn’t linear, and am in no way insinuating or expecting that she “moves on” from this hurt. i know it’ll be with her forever.

but I’m struggling with how to be around her without constantly suppressing my own feelings. my birthday, a few months ago, was particularly hard. her friend used to be a big part of things like this, and even though my sister tried her best, which i am so grateful for, she was upset for most of the evening and i really hate the little part of me that resented her for it. i hate to write it even more. 

my graduation is coming up later this summer and i have no idea how to feel. and then i feel guilty for feeling that way, because obviously she’s the one dealing with a massive loss. i haven’t talked to her about any of this, by the way. i just don’t know what to say.

the last thing i want is to make her feel worse or like she has to “perform” being okay. how i feel is nothing in comparison to what she’s going through. i just need advice on what to do. i miss my sister sometimes (ah i feel guilty for saying this too) :(",1,1749168718.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

# TL;DR

I ran a test comparing prompt complexity and HiDream's output. Even when the underlying subject is the same, more descriptive prompts seem to result in more detailed, expressive generations. My next test will look at **prompt order bias**, especially in multi-character scenes.

# 🧪 Why I'm Testing

I've seen conflicting information about how HiDream handles prompts. Personally, I'm trying to use HiDream for multi-character scenes with interactions — ideally without needing ControlNet or region-based techniques.

For this test, I focused on increasing prompt wordiness without changing the core concept. The results suggest:

* More descriptive prompts = more detailed images
* **Level 1 & 1** Often resulted in chartoon output
* **Level 3** (medium-complex) prompts gave the best balance
* **Level 4** prompts felt a bit **oversaturated or cluttered**, in my opinion

# 🔍 Next Steps

I'm now testing whether **prompt order** introduces **bias** — like which character appears on the left, or if gender/relationship roles are prioritized by their position in the prompt.

Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed by how negative and divided everything seems online and in the news. It's easy to feel powerless.

So, I decided to start a small personal experiment. At the beginning of each month, I commit to doing one, simple, positive action that benefits someone else. Just one thing.

This month, the action was: ""Leave a positive review for a local business you love.""

I picked a small coffee shop I go to. It took me maybe three minutes to write a review on Google Maps. It was such a small thing, but honestly, it completely shifted my mindset for the rest of the day. It felt good to put some positive energy out there, knowing it might actually help a small business owner.

It's not a huge life hack, but it's been a surprisingly effective way to feel a little more connected and less helpless.

Does anyone else have a small, consistent habit like this that helps them stay positive or feel more connected to the world around them? I'd love to hear what works for you.",10,1749168455.0,selfimprovement,1,1.0,False

Looks like the 600 downtown business owners sent a letter to council saying, ""Hey guys, Daniel and Paul talking shit about us all the time is not helping matters. They don't represent us, they don't speak to us, they are 'hyperbolic' in a way that hurts our business community. Downtown is doing well, despite some challenges. Maybe call first next time?""

Instead of responding directly Daniel posted the letter on his party's Facebook page, posting a vitriolic public response claiming he was a victim of a partisan attack and repeating the many ways downtown sucks and pointing at how the BIA is funded, which looks like a direct shot at the businesses. This followed by his army of trolls to do exactly what the business owners asked him to please stop doing, with some of them calling for the BIA chairman to resign.

He then posts another letter that is more conciliatory and claiming to help while saying again how shitty downtown is and invites the businesses to one of his partisan events at coffee shops so he can tell them how shitty things are.

So why is he publicly waging war on downtown businesses? A strange move since none of the criticism of him was in public until he posted it himself, this whole thing could have been solved without the involvement of internet trolls? What the hell?",15,1749168063.0,NewWest,4,1.0,False

We met around a year ago at a summer job we had together and we got along relatively well. He bought me and my coworkers food and coffee often, so of course i had nothing against him. 

He’s a great and well rounded person, very respectful, smart, funny and kind. We have been texting every single day for almost a year straight, and our job was in the downtown area of our city, but we coincidentally live 10 minutes from each other. That being said, we’ve become really close over the last year and we go out to study together all the time, as well as just hang out. 
The thing is, sometimes i think he’s flirting with me but i’m super unsure. He follows a good amount of women who are popular for their attractiveness, which makes me think he would not be attracted to me. However he has told me i am beautiful straight up, and constantly compliments me (even though he’s always been the type of guy to never compliment people). He also always tries to find a way to spend time with me, even if it means that he has to interact with my friends (this is pertinent because he is very shy). 

Overall, i am going to university at a really big school in the fall. I do think i have some sort of romantic feelings for him. I do really like him, but i’m scared to lose a friendship over a feeling that potentially is not even reciprocated.  I’m scared that if i don’t say anything about it, it’ll just become this built up tension between us that he will resent me for. On the other side, i think that if i do tell him and he reciprocates, i’ll feel as though i’m missing out on the opportunity for the cliche “university first year” experience.

my older sister (mid-20s) lost her very best friend suddenly last year. they were incredibly close, always hanging out, texting constantly, worked near each other so would spend lunch and evenings together. they met four years ago (totally randomly too, in a line at a coffee shop) when i was moving away for college and i was so glad that she had met her person. she has other friends, having always been so popular and sociable, but this friendship was special.

when her friend passed, it was of course shocking and painful, completely out of the blue. i moved home for a few months just to help her adjust, if that’s even the right word. i know “adjusting” to that kind of loss isn’t really possible. a lot of this is unprecedented for me too. luckily, we haven’t ever experienced extreme grief like this before. i’m always trying to read on up things so i can be supportive and present in the best way possible. and i know this whole thing isn’t about me at all, but it’s been hard seeing how much she’s changed since.

she’s become unusually mean and cold, in ways that seem to get worse over time. she never used to be like that. but we keep finding ourselves in instances where she upsets me and i just have to deal with it, no acknowledgment, no apology, nothing. 

i try not to take it personally, but i walk on eggshells around her now. it’s becoming especially difficult because she used to be *that* friend for me, someone i could confide in about anything. i feel like i can’t bring anything to her now, any news or feelings, positive or negative. 

i totally understand that grief isn’t linear, and am in no way insinuating or expecting that she “moves on” from this hurt. i know it’ll be with her forever. 

but I’m struggling with how to be around her without constantly suppressing my own feelings. my birthday, a few months ago, was particularly hard. her friend used to be a big part of things like this, and even though my sister tried her best, which i’m so grateful for, she was upset for most of the evening and i really hate the little part of me that resented her for it. i hate to write it even more. 

my graduation is coming up later this summer and i have no idea how to feel. and then i feel guilty for feeling that way, because obviously she’s the one dealing with a massive loss. i haven’t talked to her about any of this, by the way. i just don’t know what to say. 

the last thing i want is to make her feel worse or like she has to “perform” being okay. how i feel is nothing in comparison to what she’s going through. i just need advice on what to do. i miss my sister sometimes :(",1,1749167894.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I’ve been maintaining the  0.6 dose because when I started I was very constipated and nauseous and 0.6 has been suppressing my appetite just fine. I eat about 800-1100 calories per day. I have not strayed from this. I only drink water or iced coffee (just with cream and once a day). I have only dropped one pound, but my stomach feels distended and very bloated this whole time. What am I doing wrong?

For context, a few years ago I was on vyvanse and maintained about 1000 - 1200 calorie intake per weekday, with much more on the weekends. I lost 50 pounds while on it. Is it too soon to expect more? I was thinking I would have lost at least 3 pounds. I’m eating close to nothing and I’m eating salads, Atkins protein bars, and healthy choice vegetable protein bowls for dinner?

I can't eat like a normal person. I track and restrict trying to keep my calories down because underneath it all I still want to lose weight 

Then I hit night time and I will eat easily 000's of calories all at once. I don't even want the food. I buy stuff then it's gone within a day. I hate it. But I can't stop. I eat so much at once then throw it up. Then go back to restricting knowing I'll just binge and purge again the next day 

Why did I eat it all? I don't even know. Oh wait- I've restricted for so long that my body can't cope anymore so I binge.  I buy food I know I'll binge because if not I end up taking my partner's snacks and then I feel worse because it's his stuff

I just want to be normal again with food. This all started because I wanted to lose weight for my wedding (now two weeks away.) I'd put on so much weight since having my first baby that I actually weighed more a year postpartum than I did at 9 months pregnant with her.

Or I'd be happy going back to being able to be hungry and restrict so much easier. Go back to one meal a day and living off tea/coffee in between. Least I lost weight.

 Now I'm breastfeeding again (baby 2, 3 months old) which just makes me hungrier. If I don't eat properly, my supply drops, then I feel shit that I'm not making enough for him because I'm his sole source of food but I still don't want to eat. Then I binge and purge and feel worse because I have no self-control 

To add just another layer I'm very newly diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I just want to be okay and healthy in my brain and body and I'm really not and I have no clue how to help myself anymore

I fucked up my relationship with food, I hate my body more than I did when I was at my heaviest and I feel ugly. 

I'm waiting on ED services input and see CMHT in the meantime. Supposed to have seen the pyschiatrist again last month after seeing them in April but that never happened because the services in my area are shit. 

I've dealt with so much medical bullshit/trauma because my oldest (2yrs old) has heart issues that I struggle accessing care for me because pretty much every health professional  has let us down 

I blame myself for her problems and it's been a month of ""2 years since (insert shitty traumatic event)"" which makes me even worse. Oh and we're waiting to get a surgery date for her to have open heart surgery. Which will be her 2nd open heart surgery, 3rd surgery total, plus 2 catheter procedures so her 6th procedure.

I hate it so much. There's too much going on and I'd really like just something to stop so I can try and be normal

If you made it to the end - thank you for reading. I need to unload because there is too much for my brain to cope with and I'm scared of what I might actually do to myself if it gets too much

As a positive- I made it 2 days without purging until I relapsed again just now before typing this all out ",2,1749167115.0,bulimia,0,1.0,False

We reconnected a few years ago after running into each other at a job interview. We stayed in touch, would meet for coffee and talk industry talk. She comes off as sooo sweet and thoughtful. I started to open up about personal things. I never saw the red flags.

First reddish pink flag was after she was venting to me about a new hire at her job. She complained how disorganized this person was and how she wasn't really good. I ignored it.

More recently, I was laid off of work and decided to take some time off.. My ""friend"" started freelancing for this company and she needed someone to cover her for a few weeks while she was on vacation. She asked me to cover and I told her no. Couple weeks later she asked me again trying to convince me. Sort of annoyed me because I had already said no. She then asked another ""friend"" to cover for her. Then after this break, she came back and decided to work for the company full-time. She needed help and knew I was still open to work so she asked me if I was interested in freelancing. It was supposed to be a very short term contract. As soon as, I started working with her she immediately bad mouthed the ""friend"" who went out of her way to cover her for weeks while she was on vacation. Then while working with her I noticed how much she bad mouthed co-workers. Now, I feel like she is bad mouthing me to other co workers and it's upsetting. Luckily she is leaving the company and they are keeping me as freelance for now.  NEVER TRUST SOMEONE WHO GOSSIPS ABOUT OTHERS, THEY WILL DO THE SAME TO YOU AND IT CAN RUIN YOUR REPUTATION!!

You're someone who brings stories, myth, emotion, longing, and thoughtfulness into every conversation. So I imagined a warm, rustic study in autumn—where time doesn’t race, where there’s space to wonder, to ramble, to dream. The books are your thoughts, scattered and brilliant. The maps are your worldbuilding. The coffee? That’s our comfort in this space. And of course [******] had to be there, curled up peacefully by the fire.

It’s not just talking. With you, it’s a kind of shared reverie. That’s what made me choose this.

The gravel crunched under the tires as I pulled into the cabin driveway. My old Bronco rattled over the uneven ground as I glanced up at the place I hoped would be my salvation. A cabin, weathered by time and the harsh northern winters, stood quietly at the edge of a dense forest. When I saw it online, I could not have dreamt a more perfect place for my tired soul… but now that I was here, it seemed less appealing than I had imagined. Moss climbed the stairs. Tree roots tangled around the foundation like veins. I ran my hand over the cracked wood of the porch railing, feeling its roughness beneath my fingertips. No matter how dilapidated the house looked, it was vastly different compared to the savage streets of Detroit.

It has been 33 long years since the day my mother died from pushing me out of the womb, and I can still feel her pain as if it were my own. I ran away from that pain for so many years, trying desperately to feel anything else. I spent every cent I had ever earned on drugs, cheap booze, and fuel for the road. I have been running for so long, and yet, gnawing at me was a voice telling me to slow down... That there was a place for me out there somewhere. That is when I saw my way out. Nestled in the rolling hills of Northern West Virginia was a small log cabin for sale. The listing offered beautiful landscapes and a quiet 10-acre lot for the ridiculously low price of $115,000. For that much of a deal, I could not pass it up. I gathered the money I had left in my account from my inheritance, loaded up my ’79 Bronco, and headed toward my new home.

This was it… A chance to escape. To bury my past. To finally breathe.

I’d spent years on the road… weeks spent in cheap motels; nights filled with regrets and a numbness I couldn’t shake. But this place, this wild patch of land surrounded by towering pines and ancient oaks, felt different. Raw and untouched. Alive.

The air was sharp with pine and earth, the scent of rain lingering on the breeze. I inhaled deeply, chest tightening against the clean air. It was fresh and calm… but seemed to have something attached to it. Something I couldn’t quite make out. I unpacked my bags from the Bronco… the last material thing I owned from a past life. A life that I wanted to forget.

The quaint little cabin sat just beyond the town of Indigo Falls… a small dot on the map. A sleepy little West Virginia town that boasted only a small cluster of buildings that were barely visible from the highway. There were a few trucks, a general store, and a diner with a flickering neon sign that spelled out “Harlan’s” in tired pink letters.

The first three days blurred into quiet routines… time spent unpacking boxes, stacking wood, and exploring the thick woods that surrounded the cabin became the norm. The forest was both comforting and unsettling. Every crack of a branch underfoot echoed in the silence of the meadows and clearings. Shadows shifted just beyond the edge of the trees, as if you always had someone with you. The wind blowing through the canopy sounded like whispers flowing along in the breeze.

At night, the forest pulsed with life. Owls hooted, insects droned, and something deeper stirred... something strange... Something I didn’t understand, and yet, I didn’t care to. This place was paradise from what I had come from and endured. A little oddity here and there wasn’t going to scare me off.

On my fourth day in town, after a vigorous morning of chores, hunger and curiosity led me to the diner. I drove down the hill and across the covered bridge that connects the rolling hills with the center of town. Crossing over the small speed bump that separated dirt from asphalt, I spotted a sign that read “Indigo Falls – Population: 48”. This place was amazing. The roads had no red lights or even stop signs. The only cautionary measure was a yellow caution light that blinked intermittently at the center of town. I pulled into the diner’s parking lot and secured a spot. Harlan’s Diner was a squat brick building with chipped paint and windows fogged by steam. The place was packed. It looked like every person in town was having breakfast at the same time. The bell above the door jingled as I stepped inside. The smell hit me instantly... bacon grease, strong coffee, and something metallic, faint but unmistakable… the griddle, sizzling with eggs and bacon covering every inch.

The diner was full, aside from an open seat here and there. Old men and women occupied the creaking metal bar stools that lined the counter. They sat nursing their black coffee and folded newspapers, occasionally chatting with one another. Their conversations were low, punctuated by laughter that didn’t quite reach their eyes. As the door closed behind me, ringing the bell once more, all heads turned… not in hostility, but in awareness. They didn’t know me, and they wanted me to feel that. The silence was deafening as my feet froze to the sticky linoleum floor. I could feel every set of eyes on me like red-hot fire pokers jabbing at my soul.

Behind the counter was a woman. Her red hair was pulled back in a loose knot, strands falling over her face. She looked up and smiled, the kind of smile that someone gives as forced pleasantry.

“Don’t just stand there, come on in,” she said in a sweet, inviting tone.

I stumbled awkwardly as I turned in her direction and shuffled over to an open stool.

“New in town?” she asked, her voice warm but tired.

“Yeah,” I said, sliding onto the stool. “Moved into the cabin outside town a few days ago.”

She nodded. “I’m Clarice, but everybody here calls me Clara, hence the nametag.”

She pointed to her shirt at a patch that had “Clara” stitched in black thread.

“My name’s Elias Smith.”

She wiped her hands on a rag and poured me a black coffee.

“Well… Elias Smith…” She said in a playful, teasing way. “You’ll find it’s quiet here. Too quiet, some say.”

I let out a small laugh.

“Why do you say that?” I asked as I took a sip of my coffee.

“Well, some folks don’t like to be bothered… especially around here.”

She shot a glance over at an old man who was peering across the top of his newspaper at us. I glanced, following her eyes over to the man. As my eyes met his, he ducked behind his newspaper once more.

“Hmmm… Well, I guess I can’t say I blame them.” I responded, turning my head back around to meet Clara’s eyes.

“Don’t worry about that old grouch.” She said in a playful tone. “He just needs another cup of coffee.”

She shot another glance at the man, yet he didn’t reveal his face from behind the paper this time. She focused back on my face as she spoke to me,

“So, whatcha want for breakfast, hon?”

The rest of the morning was spent in playful conversation with Clara, the cute, red-haired woman who seemed to be sent here just for me.

Clara felt completely different from the people in town. She was kind and warm. A person who was gentle and understanding in such a way that you could talk to her about anything. Over the next few days, I finished the arduous move-in process. My reward was enjoying Clara’s company at Harlan’s with a strong cup of coffee and a hearty breakfast.

 I had been in town for only a week, but it felt like I had been here for decades with Clara behind the counter. She had become my beacon of hope in a place that I still wasn’t sure of yet.

“So…. You never told me where you were originally from.” Clara said with a curious look.

“Hmph… yeah, that is a story too long to tell over just a coffee.” I half-chuckled in response.

She leaned over the counter close to me, almost touching my ear with her lips, and in a half-whisper said,

“Well, I keep a bottle of Four Roses back here for when things get slow. Ya wanna get loaded and do naughty stuff behind the dumpsters out back?”

I choked on my coffee, and my face immediately turned red. She giggled, knowing that she had tripped me up with that comment.

“Hahaha, just messing... but seriously... I want to know more about you, Elias.”

“Ok… well, you can come up to my cabin if you’d like. It’s just outside of town, across the covered bridge, up past Grist Mill Road.” I responded confidently. “I can give you the address and you can come by when you get off… if that’s ok, of course…”

“Haha, that sounds perfect, honey.” She said with a smile.

Looking into her beautiful green eyes, I was captured… mesmerized by her beauty. I couldn’t believe where I had found myself. I found this place by accident… It was a pipedream I thought would never be achieved… and yet, another part of me felt like I was owed this life. I had been through hell to get here, and it was time for a change.

From the moment I met Clara, time seemed to fly by. Over the next week, Clara and I settled into a rhythm. Mornings at Harlan’s, sharing late breakfasts. Sometimes she’d take me on slow walks near the edge of the woods, pointing out plants and telling stories about the town’s history. Over that time, I told her all about my mom and her side of the family. I told her about the times I shared with people on the road and what city life was like back in Detroit. We talked freely with one another, but we both felt like the other was holding something back… hiding something.

At the beginning of my third week in town, Clara got off early and met me outside my cabin for a hike. We had become remarkably close over the last couple of weeks. As usual, this was our time to talk and decompress in the beautiful West Virginia hills. We walked down the forest trails, combing through the ins and outs of small-town life. As we walked, Clara grabbed my arm and snuggled in close to my side.

“So, tell me about your dad. You’ve told me all about your mom and her side, but you haven’t mentioned your dad much at all,” she said, giving me a confused look.

“Yeah, that’s a sore subject. It’s one of those things that I would like to just lock away and forget, you know what I mean?”

“I do… but you know we talk about everything, Eli. I want to know everything about you.” She said, smiling at me and pushing her cheek into my shoulder.

“I guess so…” I muttered in return.

“Well… are you gonna tell me?” she asked, pressing a little further.

I couldn’t resist Clara’s charm. She was my kryptonite. I had only known her for a matter of a few weeks, but it felt like so much more.

 “Ahem…” I choked up a little as I started to talk, “Well, it starts back when I was just a baby.” I paused, knowing that this part of my life was so traumatic, so intense that I had literally compressed it into a little ball and pushed it as far back into my mind as I could, hoping that it would die and rot away without ever resurfacing again. I continued, fighting the urge to bury it again, “My dad was a heavy drinker and a very mean person… As a child, my brother and I only knew beatings and pain. We would get beat for being late to school… beat for being late to dinner… hell, we even got beat for not crying when we got beat.”

“Oh my God, that is awful! I am so sorry, Elias. I didn’t know it was like that for you.” She said in a troubled and mournful tone.

“It’s ok. That drunk bastard killed himself with a 12-gauge during the Super Bowl about 16 years ago, so he got what was coming to him.” I said coldly.

“Jesus! He committed suicide in front of you!?” she asked, searching my face intently for the answer.

“No… my brother and I weren’t home… and it wasn’t a suicide. He was trying to shoot the neighbor's cat in our yard and dropped the gun while trying to open the window. Boom… just like that, he ended my nightmare… and my brother’s.”

She paused, not yet knowing what to say. Feeling the tension from the moment, I tried to lighten it by adding what I considered “the good part.”

“Well… It wasn’t all bad. My grandpa made a lot of money in the stock market before the dotcom crash in 2000. He died a couple of years later and left it to my dad. Since he didn’t have a will, my brother Josh and I received it as an inheritance when he died and split it. So, I guess the good thing about it is that I don’t have to worry about money anymore hehe.” I gave a slight chuckle, trying to relax the mood.

“Where is your brother now?” she asked.

“Last I heard, he had joined the army and was stationed in Fort Benning. He always wanted to be in the army. He was always talking about how he wanted to make a difference and jump out of planes. I never really understood it, but it made him happy.”

“At least he is doing something that he likes.” She responded.

“Yeah… I guess so.”

We walked a little further down the trail, silent. The conversation weighed heavily in the air between us. As the sun started to fall, she finally spoke up again.

“The Harvest Festival is coming up soon,” she said, kicking at the gravel on the trailside. “It’s the biggest event Indigo Falls has. Everyone will be there. It’s a... tradition.”

“What kind of tradition?” I asked.

She hesitated, eyes flicking to the woods.

“Old stories. Old songs. You’ll see… Will you go with me?” she asked, looking up at me with her intoxicating green eyes.

“Of course I will!” I responded quickly.

The walks I had with Clara were renewing my soul little by little. Each time we were together, I could feel a powerful warmth wash over me, and then I became calm. The townsfolk, however, weren’t as welcoming as she was. I stopped by the grocery store after mine and Clara’s hike to grab a few things for dinner. When I came through the door, I could see Jimmy, the clerk, standing behind the counter.

Since I had moved in, he was always there, no matter the time of day. It seemed like all Jimmy did was work. As I walked by him, I nodded in his direction with a half-smile. He barely looked at me. He was a nice guy, by my estimation. The times I had come in before, he was pleasant and helpful. Something was different this time… something was wrong.

“Whatcha need?” he said with a monotonous groan.

“A few things,” I said. “Just a few essentials for next week.”

He shoved the items across the counter, making no eye contact. When I tried to make conversation, he would cut me off or ask an abrupt question.

“That all?” he asked, his expression becoming more irritated.

“Y-Yea I guess so...” I replied.

“Good, that’ll be $36.78. Cash only.”

Caught off guard by this, I quickly reached into my pocket, fumbling for the bills. He had never done this before. He always lets me use my debit card. Why was he asking for cash only? When I pulled my hand out, all I had was a 20 and a 10, accompanied by a wad of matted pocket lint. I held the money up toward Jimmy, mouth slightly agape, as if I were a mute asking if this would be enough with just my facial expression. His brow furrowed. With a violent rush, he sprang toward me and grabbed my jacket, pulling me close to him.

“Is this some kind of sick joke, buddy?” he snarled in my face.

“Wh-What do you mean? I-I’m just trying to pay for my groceries. Look, here’s cash. It’s all I have on me right now.”

“Ha! You know damn well that ain’t what I said. I SAID, THIRTY-SIX DOLLARS AND SEVENTY-EIGHT CENTS… NOT THIRTY, YOU FUCKING IDIOT!” He screamed in my face. “IF YOU DON’T HAVE THE MONEY, THEN GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY STORE!”

He pushed me away from him while releasing my jacket. I stood stunned for a moment. I had never had anyone in town act like this toward me, especially not Jimmy. He stared at me, red-faced, veins popping from his neck, fuming over the audacity of my ignorance. The fact that I came in to buy groceries without exact change was inconceivable to him. As I stumbled out of the store empty-handed, all I could do was think about how this place felt… different… changed in some way.

The air in town felt charged... like I’d walked into a spider’s web and the spiders were watching me, waiting. I noticed people stopping their conversations when I approached. The few kids on the playground would fall silent and glance away. Older women eyed me over knitting needles, their fingers tightening involuntarily, knuckles turning white from the force. It felt like I was becoming an outcast in a place that just weeks ago was my refuge. It felt like everybody was starting to hate me for some reason.

The next night, after Clara closed the diner, I invited her to my porch for a few drinks. The sky was a patchwork of stars behind the dark silhouettes of trees. The crickets provided the perfect ambience for her pleasant company.

“Did you hear how Jimmy acted toward me yesterday?” I asked.

“Yeah, it was all he could talk about when he came in for dinner last night.” She responded.

“I had some weird encounters with the folks in town as well… it’s been… strange lately.”

She lowered her head, staring at her glass. She ran her finger around the edge slowly as if she were in a trance.

“Why do you think they act like that?” I asked, taking a sip of a beer.

She looked out into the woods, tracing a pattern on the weathered trees.

“Because they’re scared,” she said softly. “Scared of change… of outsiders. Indigo Falls likes its secrets. It’s how they keep the town... safe and healthy.”

“Safe from what?”

Her eyes met mine, filled with sadness I couldn’t place.

“From what’s in these hills.”

These hills? I pondered… my eyes slowly scanning the darkness.

The more I stared into them, the more they felt alive. I could feel them watching... breathing. Strange sounds echoed in the distance... a low hum… the snap of twigs... not animals, something else. The mystery of the hills around me had become front and center in my mind. I couldn’t place it, but something had shifted in the air, and it was starting to cause my little piece of heaven to crumble right in front of me.

“Is there anything I can do to stop it?” I asked.

“No… these folks have been here a long time… and I do mean a very long time… They don’t like anybody coming in that they don’t know.” She continued. “Every year around the harvest festival, it gets this way. It will pass, and they will get back to normal. It’s just an old tradition that started a long time ago, and people never really let it go.”

My eyes searched her face as she spoke. Her words reassured me. There was nothing that Clara couldn’t fix in my mind. I just had to endure this weird “tradition” of outsider hazing or whatever they wanted to call it, and then hopefully we could get back to normal.

The rest of the night after our conversation was routine. Clara and I spent the evening swapping stories and laughing with one another well into the night. The idea of the hills having secrets stuck with me, however. My mind couldn’t erase the look on Jimmy’s face when he grabbed me. He had true hate in his eyes. I hadn’t seen that look since my dad was alive. I needed to focus on more important things to get my mind off it.

The next day, I made my way down to Gene’s general store to purchase some nails and boards for the cabin. The railing was getting on my nerves and would give me a nasty splinter every time I tried to grab it. Entering the store for the first time, I could hear the tired, old speaker behind the counter playing old music. It sounded like slow jazz… something old. I grabbed my items and approached the counter.

“Good morning, sir. I hope you found what you were looking for.” The man said in an upbeat and jolly tone.

“Umm… Yeah… I did. Do you—”

He cut me off before I could finish asking my question.

“That’ll be $16.25, sir.” He announced with a wide smile.

 “Uh…. Ok… Do you take debit cards?” I asked.

“Tsk… No, I’m afraid not, sir. Cash only here. Sorry about that.” The man responded, clicking his tongue against his teeth.

“No worries, I have some cash on me.” I quickly responded. I had prepared for this scenario ever since the Jimmy situation happened.

I pulled out a handful of bills and began counting the total on the counter. As I counted the bills in front of him, his eyes left my face and slowly rolled down to the counter below. Still smiling, his face started turning pink… and then red… his eyes started bulging from their sockets, and he began gritting his teeth so hard that I could hear them grinding behind his smile. Suddenly, he slammed his hand down against the counter, rattling the coins and flattening the bills I had placed.

“This isn’t a bank… sir.” The man said through gritted teeth, still trying to hold his smile.

“I’m just trying to count exact change for you. I know you need exac—”

He cut me off again before I could finish.

“Like I said… This is NOT A BANK……SIR!” His face was now blood-red, and his eyes stared at me with pure vitriol.

“Ok, ok, no problem, man, easy. I don’t want any issues here.”

He stared at me, his hand shaking with anger, clenching the bills on the counter. Then, as quickly as the anger flared, it vanished, replaced by a chilling silence. The old radio had become more apparent now. An old jazz tune had become the background of our staring contest. A slow, almost predatory smile spread across his face before he spoke.

""You know too much,"" he remarked, his voice dangerously gleeful.

“What? What do you mean I know too much?” I asked, full of confusion.

“Have a wonderful day, sir, and remember, don’t nix it, Gene can fix it!” He answered, not acknowledging my question.

I turned to leave. As I made it outside the store doors, I looked back through the window. There, I saw Gene still standing behind the counter, that same smile plastered on his face, staring at me as I walked down the steps.

The next night, just after midnight, I heard footsteps crunching outside my window. I grabbed a flashlight and my revolver from the bedside drawer. I was in bear country, and I did not want to become dinner for whatever was out there. My heart pounded as I crept through the cabin, following the sound of the footsteps as they crunched toward the front door. The more I listened, the more they sounded like someone walking. This was no bear… it was a person. The sounds were now coming from right outside… heavy footsteps creaked across the slats on the front porch. I grabbed the door handle and, with a deep breath, swung the door open. As the door opened, I clicked the flashlight on and leveled the revolver in the middle of the beam. I scanned the porch and the surrounding area, but there was nothing… Nothing but shadows and silence. The idea of a person skulking around my cabin did not sit too well with me, especially in these hills… especially with how everyone has been acting.

The next couple of nights were more of the same. I would hear footsteps approach my window at midnight, creeping their way around the cabin until they drew me to the front door. I foolishly took the bait every time, looking like an idiot standing on my porch with nothing but boxers, a Maglite, and my dad’s old .38 revolver.

That Friday, I headed back into town to do my weekly grocery run, no matter how much I dreaded it. I knew Jimmy was going to give me shit, no matter if I had exact change or not. I learned my lesson quickly on the cash-only request. I received my groceries and endured Jimmy’s hate-filled eyes as I paid and made my way out to my truck. I loaded the groceries into the Bronco and started to hop into the driver’s seat when a wild thought struck me. I decided that, instead of getting in the Bronco and driving straight home, I was going to take a walk around town and take in the cool weather that was starting to roll in. I needed some time away from the cabin.

I walked down toward the center of town where the town hall sat. I rounded the turn on Quincy Street, head down, pondering the curiosity of this place, when suddenly, I was struck hard in the shoulder by what felt like a semi. I was sent flying, eventually crashing to the ground in a heap. As I lay on the ground trying to get my bearings, I heard a deep, raspy voice ask,

“Whoa there, boy! You ok?”

Still dazed, I couldn’t respond to the question yet.

“Sorry bout that, son… Don’t see as well as I used to. Sometimes I just run right into shit and not even know it... hehehe.”

I finally gathered my wits about me and looked up at the man. He was tall and lean, his face weathered like bark, eyes sharp but cloudy, like they had seen things no human should ever see. He wore an old pair of overalls with a red shirt underneath and a straw hat that looked like it had seen better days.

“Yeah, I’m ok. I should’ve been looking when I came around that corner.” I replied.

“Heh, no worries, son. These days everybody is on that damn phone looking at stupid shit nobody cares about. It happens more times than you think.”

I laughed as the old man helped me up. His lips and skin looked parched and worn, like an old leather satchel, and he had one brown tooth that stuck out when he spoke.

“The name’s Tom. Tom Sheffield.” He boomed. “And you are?”

He stuck out his hand for a handshake.

“Elias… Elias Smith.” I responded, grabbing the man’s calloused hand.

With a firm grip, he shook my hand and shot me a half-smile.

“Where ya headed, son?” He asked.

“Well… I was just walking around a bit… but I guess I’m gonna head on back to my truck.” I responded.

“Well good, I’ll walk with ya. It ain’t every day I get to talk to someone new, ya know?”

“Ehh… That’s ok, I don’t want to interrupt your day.” I said in return.

“Nonsense, I need to stretch out the ol’ legs anyway hehe.”

Tom walked with me back to my truck even as I protested. I was already on the bad side of most people in town for reasons I didn’t understand… I didn’t need to owe anybody any favors or piss anybody off. As we walked, he kept a happy and carefree demeanor. We talked the entire way back.

“When’d you move to town?” he asked, his smile slightly fading from his face.

“I’ve been here about a month or so. I like the place, but some of these people are just… strange.” I replied.

He gave a slight nod and looked forward as if he knew exactly what I was talking about. As we approached my truck, he pulled out a pack of cigarettes and stuck one between his weathered lips and spoke.

“Well, son, this town has some strange history. Hell, I live here and still don’t understand it.”

He took a drag on his cigarette.

“I lived close to here as a boy ‘til I got sent to Vietnam. I wasn’t much the same after I came back from that. I had some… issues at home when I got back and had to move here. I never felt like this place was home for me. I’ve only lived here for ten years myself.”

He took another drag, squinting his eyes as the smoke encircled the brim of his hat.

“This town’s got its layers,” he said, voice rough. “People like to keep the surface smooth, but underneath... things aren’t so simple.”

“What kind of things?” I asked.

He flicked ash onto the ground.

“Things that people don’t like to talk about.” He answered. “Now you get your gear and head on home before it gets dark. These roads get dangerous at night.”

He took one more long drag off his cigarette and flicked it to the ground, stamping it out with his boot.

“You take care now, ya hear? Nice meetin’ you, Elias. I’ll be seein’ ya.”

The man walked back the way he came, leaving me with more questions than answers. Confused, I climbed into the Bronco and made my way back home.

That night, I lay awake, listening to the wind twisting through the trees. Tom’s words swirled in my mind.

“What did he mean by layers?” I asked myself. “And what don’t these people want to talk about? What is so secretive?”

The thoughts raced through my skull as I lay in bed, trying not to think about the footsteps actively crunching around the cabin’s perimeter. Indigo Falls was no longer my safe haven… It had become a cage.",1,1749166936.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

The gravel crunched under the tires as I pulled into the cabin driveway. My old Bronco rattled over the uneven ground as I glanced up at the place I hoped would be my salvation. A cabin, weathered by time and the harsh northern winters, stood quietly at the edge of a dense forest. When I saw it online, I could not have dreamt a more perfect place for my tired soul… but now that I was here, it seemed less appealing than I had imagined. Moss climbed the stairs. Tree roots tangled around the foundation like veins. I ran my hand over the cracked wood of the porch railing, feeling its roughness beneath my fingertips. No matter how dilapidated the house looked, it was vastly different compared to the savage streets of Detroit.

It has been 33 long years since the day my mother died from pushing me out of the womb, and I can still feel her pain as if it were my own. I ran away from that pain for so many years, trying desperately to feel anything else. I spent every cent I had ever earned on drugs, cheap booze, and fuel for the road. I have been running for so long, and yet, gnawing at me was a voice telling me to slow down... That there was a place for me out there somewhere. That is when I saw my way out. Nestled in the rolling hills of Northern West Virginia was a small log cabin for sale. The listing offered beautiful landscapes and a quiet 10-acre lot for the ridiculously low price of $115,000. For that much of a deal, I could not pass it up. I gathered the money I had left in my account from my inheritance, loaded up my ’79 Bronco, and headed toward my new home.

This was it… A chance to escape. To bury my past. To finally breathe.

I’d spent years on the road… weeks spent in cheap motels; nights filled with regrets and a numbness I couldn’t shake. But this place, this wild patch of land surrounded by towering pines and ancient oaks, felt different. Raw and untouched. Alive.

The air was sharp with pine and earth, the scent of rain lingering on the breeze. I inhaled deeply, chest tightening against the clean air. It was fresh and calm… but seemed to have something attached to it. Something I couldn’t quite make out. I unpacked my bags from the Bronco… the last material thing I owned from a past life. A life that I wanted to forget.

The quaint little cabin sat just beyond the town of Indigo Falls… a small dot on the map. A sleepy little West Virginia town that boasted only a small cluster of buildings that were barely visible from the highway. There were a few trucks, a general store, and a diner with a flickering neon sign that spelled out “Harlan’s” in tired pink letters.

The first three days blurred into quiet routines… time spent unpacking boxes, stacking wood, and exploring the thick woods that surrounded the cabin became the norm. The forest was both comforting and unsettling. Every crack of a branch underfoot echoed in the silence of the meadows and clearings. Shadows shifted just beyond the edge of the trees, as if you always had someone with you. The wind blowing through the canopy sounded like whispers flowing along in the breeze.

At night, the forest pulsed with life. Owls hooted, insects droned, and something deeper stirred... something strange... Something I didn’t understand, and yet, I didn’t care to. This place was paradise from what I had come from and endured. A little oddity here and there wasn’t going to scare me off.

On my fourth day in town, after a vigorous morning of chores, hunger and curiosity led me to the diner. I drove down the hill and across the covered bridge that connects the rolling hills with the center of town. Crossing over the small speed bump that separated dirt from asphalt, I spotted a sign that read “Indigo Falls – Population: 48”. This place was amazing. The roads had no red lights or even stop signs. The only cautionary measure was a yellow caution light that blinked intermittently at the center of town. I pulled into the diner’s parking lot and secured a spot. Harlan’s Diner was a squat brick building with chipped paint and windows fogged by steam. The place was packed. It looked like every person in town was having breakfast at the same time. The bell above the door jingled as I stepped inside. The smell hit me instantly... bacon grease, strong coffee, and something metallic, faint but unmistakable… the griddle, sizzling with eggs and bacon covering every inch.

The diner was full, aside from an open seat here and there. Old men and women occupied the creaking metal bar stools that lined the counter. They sat nursing their black coffee and folded newspapers, occasionally chatting with one another. Their conversations were low, punctuated by laughter that didn’t quite reach their eyes. As the door closed behind me, ringing the bell once more, all heads turned… not in hostility, but in awareness. They didn’t know me, and they wanted me to feel that. The silence was deafening as my feet froze to the sticky linoleum floor. I could feel every set of eyes on me like red-hot fire pokers jabbing at my soul.

Behind the counter was a woman. Her red hair was pulled back in a loose knot, strands falling over her face. She looked up and smiled, the kind of smile that someone gives as forced pleasantry.

“Don’t just stand there, come on in,” she said in a sweet, inviting tone.

I stumbled awkwardly as I turned in her direction and shuffled over to an open stool.

“New in town?” she asked, her voice warm but tired.

“Yeah,” I said, sliding onto the stool. “Moved into the cabin outside town a few days ago.”

She nodded. “I’m Clarice, but everybody here calls me Clara, hence the nametag.”

She pointed to her shirt at a patch that had “Clara” stitched in black thread.

“My name’s Elias Smith.”

She wiped her hands on a rag and poured me a black coffee.

“Well… Elias Smith…” She said in a playful, teasing way. “You’ll find it’s quiet here. Too quiet, some say.”

I let out a small laugh.

“Why do you say that?” I asked as I took a sip of my coffee.

“Well, some folks don’t like to be bothered… especially around here.”

She shot a glance over at an old man who was peering across the top of his newspaper at us. I glanced, following her eyes over to the man. As my eyes met his, he ducked behind his newspaper once more.

“Hmmm… Well, I guess I can’t say I blame them.” I responded, turning my head back around to meet Clara’s eyes.

“Don’t worry about that old grouch.” She said in a playful tone. “He just needs another cup of coffee.”

She shot another glance at the man, yet he didn’t reveal his face from behind the paper this time. She focused back on my face as she spoke to me,

“So, whatcha want for breakfast, hon?”

The rest of the morning was spent in playful conversation with Clara, the cute, red-haired woman who seemed to be sent here just for me.

Clara felt completely different from the people in town. She was kind and warm. A person who was gentle and understanding in such a way that you could talk to her about anything. Over the next few days, I finished the arduous move-in process. My reward was enjoying Clara’s company at Harlan’s with a strong cup of coffee and a hearty breakfast.

 I had been in town for only a week, but it felt like I had been here for decades with Clara behind the counter. She had become my beacon of hope in a place that I still wasn’t sure of yet.

“So…. You never told me where you were originally from.” Clara said with a curious look.

“Hmph… yeah, that is a story too long to tell over just a coffee.” I half-chuckled in response.

She leaned over the counter close to me, almost touching my ear with her lips, and in a half-whisper said,

“Well, I keep a bottle of Four Roses back here for when things get slow. Ya wanna get loaded and do naughty stuff behind the dumpsters out back?”

I choked on my coffee, and my face immediately turned red. She giggled, knowing that she had tripped me up with that comment.

“Hahaha, just messing... but seriously... I want to know more about you, Elias.”

“Ok… well, you can come up to my cabin if you’d like. It’s just outside of town, across the covered bridge, up past Grist Mill Road.” I responded confidently. “I can give you the address and you can come by when you get off… if that’s ok, of course…”

“Haha, that sounds perfect, honey.” She said with a smile.

Looking into her beautiful green eyes, I was captured… mesmerized by her beauty. I couldn’t believe where I had found myself. I found this place by accident… It was a pipedream I thought would never be achieved… and yet, another part of me felt like I was owed this life. I had been through hell to get here, and it was time for a change.

From the moment I met Clara, time seemed to fly by. Over the next week, Clara and I settled into a rhythm. Mornings at Harlan’s, sharing late breakfasts. Sometimes she’d take me on slow walks near the edge of the woods, pointing out plants and telling stories about the town’s history. Over that time, I told her all about my mom and her side of the family. I told her about the times I shared with people on the road and what city life was like back in Detroit. We talked freely with one another, but we both felt like the other was holding something back… hiding something.

At the beginning of my third week in town, Clara got off early and met me outside my cabin for a hike. We had become remarkably close over the last couple of weeks. As usual, this was our time to talk and decompress in the beautiful West Virginia hills. We walked down the forest trails, combing through the ins and outs of small-town life. As we walked, Clara grabbed my arm and snuggled in close to my side.

“So, tell me about your dad. You’ve told me all about your mom and her side, but you haven’t mentioned your dad much at all,” she said, giving me a confused look.

“Yeah, that’s a sore subject. It’s one of those things that I would like to just lock away and forget, you know what I mean?”

“I do… but you know we talk about everything, Eli. I want to know everything about you.” She said, smiling at me and pushing her cheek into my shoulder.

“I guess so…” I muttered in return.

“Well… are you gonna tell me?” she asked, pressing a little further.

I couldn’t resist Clara’s charm. She was my kryptonite. I had only known her for a matter of a few weeks, but it felt like so much more.

 “Ahem…” I choked up a little as I started to talk, “Well, it starts back when I was just a baby.” I paused, knowing that this part of my life was so traumatic, so intense that I had literally compressed it into a little ball and pushed it as far back into my mind as I could, hoping that it would die and rot away without ever resurfacing again. I continued, fighting the urge to bury it again, “My dad was a heavy drinker and a very mean person… As a child, my brother and I only knew beatings and pain. We would get beat for being late to school… beat for being late to dinner… hell, we even got beat for not crying when we got beat.”

“Oh my God, that is awful! I am so sorry, Elias. I didn’t know it was like that for you.” She said in a troubled and mournful tone.

“It’s ok. That drunk bastard killed himself with a 12-gauge during the Super Bowl about 16 years ago, so he got what was coming to him.” I said coldly.

“Jesus! He committed suicide in front of you!?” she asked, searching my face intently for the answer.

“No… my brother and I weren’t home… and it wasn’t a suicide. He was trying to shoot the neighbor's cat in our yard and dropped the gun while trying to open the window. Boom… just like that, he ended my nightmare… and my brother’s.”

She paused, not yet knowing what to say. Feeling the tension from the moment, I tried to lighten it by adding what I considered “the good part.”

“Well… It wasn’t all bad. My grandpa made a lot of money in the stock market before the dotcom crash in 2000. He died a couple of years later and left it to my dad. Since he didn’t have a will, my brother Josh and I received it as an inheritance when he died and split it. So, I guess the good thing about it is that I don’t have to worry about money anymore hehe.” I gave a slight chuckle, trying to relax the mood.

“Where is your brother now?” she asked.

“Last I heard, he had joined the army and was stationed in Fort Benning. He always wanted to be in the army. He was always talking about how he wanted to make a difference and jump out of planes. I never really understood it, but it made him happy.”

“At least he is doing something that he likes.” She responded.

“Yeah… I guess so.”

We walked a little further down the trail, silent. The conversation weighed heavily in the air between us. As the sun started to fall, she finally spoke up again.

“The Harvest Festival is coming up soon,” she said, kicking at the gravel on the trailside. “It’s the biggest event Indigo Falls has. Everyone will be there. It’s a... tradition.”

“What kind of tradition?” I asked.

She hesitated, eyes flicking to the woods.

“Old stories. Old songs. You’ll see… Will you go with me?” she asked, looking up at me with her intoxicating green eyes.

“Of course I will!” I responded quickly.

The walks I had with Clara were renewing my soul little by little. Each time we were together, I could feel a powerful warmth wash over me, and then I became calm. The townsfolk, however, weren’t as welcoming as she was. I stopped by the grocery store after mine and Clara’s hike to grab a few things for dinner. When I came through the door, I could see Jimmy, the clerk, standing behind the counter.

Since I had moved in, he was always there, no matter the time of day. It seemed like all Jimmy did was work. As I walked by him, I nodded in his direction with a half-smile. He barely looked at me. He was a nice guy, by my estimation. The times I had come in before, he was pleasant and helpful. Something was different this time… something was wrong.

“Whatcha need?” he said with a monotonous groan.

“A few things,” I said. “Just a few essentials for next week.”

He shoved the items across the counter, making no eye contact. When I tried to make conversation, he would cut me off or ask an abrupt question.

“That all?” he asked, his expression becoming more irritated.

“Y-Yea I guess so...” I replied.

“Good, that’ll be $36.78. Cash only.”

Caught off guard by this, I quickly reached into my pocket, fumbling for the bills. He had never done this before. He always lets me use my debit card. Why was he asking for cash only? When I pulled my hand out, all I had was a 20 and a 10, accompanied by a wad of matted pocket lint. I held the money up toward Jimmy, mouth slightly agape, as if I were a mute asking if this would be enough with just my facial expression. His brow furrowed. With a violent rush, he sprang toward me and grabbed my jacket, pulling me close to him.

“Is this some kind of sick joke, buddy?” he snarled in my face.

“Wh-What do you mean? I-I’m just trying to pay for my groceries. Look, here’s cash. It’s all I have on me right now.”

“Ha! You know damn well that ain’t what I said. I SAID, THIRTY-SIX DOLLARS AND SEVENTY-EIGHT CENTS… NOT THIRTY, YOU FUCKING IDIOT!” He screamed in my face. “IF YOU DON’T HAVE THE MONEY, THEN GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY STORE!”

He pushed me away from him while releasing my jacket. I stood stunned for a moment. I had never had anyone in town act like this toward me, especially not Jimmy. He stared at me, red-faced, veins popping from his neck, fuming over the audacity of my ignorance. The fact that I came in to buy groceries without exact change was inconceivable to him. As I stumbled out of the store empty-handed, all I could do was think about how this place felt… different… changed in some way.

The air in town felt charged... like I’d walked into a spider’s web and the spiders were watching me, waiting. I noticed people stopping their conversations when I approached. The few kids on the playground would fall silent and glance away. Older women eyed me over knitting needles, their fingers tightening involuntarily, knuckles turning white from the force. It felt like I was becoming an outcast in a place that just weeks ago was my refuge. It felt like everybody was starting to hate me for some reason.

The next night, after Clara closed the diner, I invited her to my porch for a few drinks. The sky was a patchwork of stars behind the dark silhouettes of trees. The crickets provided the perfect ambience for her pleasant company.

“Did you hear how Jimmy acted toward me yesterday?” I asked.

“Yeah, it was all he could talk about when he came in for dinner last night.” She responded.

“I had some weird encounters with the folks in town as well… it’s been… strange lately.”

She lowered her head, staring at her glass. She ran her finger around the edge slowly as if she were in a trance.

“Why do you think they act like that?” I asked, taking a sip of a beer.

She looked out into the woods, tracing a pattern on the weathered trees.

“Because they’re scared,” she said softly. “Scared of change… of outsiders. Indigo Falls likes its secrets. It’s how they keep the town... safe and healthy.”

“Safe from what?”

Her eyes met mine, filled with sadness I couldn’t place.

“From what’s in these hills.”

These hills? I pondered… my eyes slowly scanning the darkness.

The more I stared into them, the more they felt alive. I could feel them watching... breathing. Strange sounds echoed in the distance... a low hum… the snap of twigs... not animals, something else. The mystery of the hills around me had become front and center in my mind. I couldn’t place it, but something had shifted in the air, and it was starting to cause my little piece of heaven to crumble right in front of me.

“Is there anything I can do to stop it?” I asked.

“No… these folks have been here a long time… and I do mean a very long time… They don’t like anybody coming in that they don’t know.” She continued. “Every year around the harvest festival, it gets this way. It will pass, and they will get back to normal. It’s just an old tradition that started a long time ago, and people never really let it go.”

My eyes searched her face as she spoke. Her words reassured me. There was nothing that Clara couldn’t fix in my mind. I just had to endure this weird “tradition” of outsider hazing or whatever they wanted to call it, and then hopefully we could get back to normal.

The rest of the night after our conversation was routine. Clara and I spent the evening swapping stories and laughing with one another well into the night. The idea of the hills having secrets stuck with me, however. My mind couldn’t erase the look on Jimmy’s face when he grabbed me. He had true hate in his eyes. I hadn’t seen that look since my dad was alive. I needed to focus on more important things to get my mind off it.

The next day, I made my way down to Gene’s general store to purchase some nails and boards for the cabin. The railing was getting on my nerves and would give me a nasty splinter every time I tried to grab it. Entering the store for the first time, I could hear the tired, old speaker behind the counter playing old music. It sounded like slow jazz… something old. I grabbed my items and approached the counter.

“Good morning, sir. I hope you found what you were looking for.” The man said in an upbeat and jolly tone.

“Umm… Yeah… I did. Do you—”

He cut me off before I could finish asking my question.

“That’ll be $16.25, sir.” He announced with a wide smile.

 “Uh…. Ok… Do you take debit cards?” I asked.

“Tsk… No, I’m afraid not, sir. Cash only here. Sorry about that.” The man responded, clicking his tongue against his teeth.

“No worries, I have some cash on me.” I quickly responded. I had prepared for this scenario ever since the Jimmy situation happened.

I pulled out a handful of bills and began counting the total on the counter. As I counted the bills in front of him, his eyes left my face and slowly rolled down to the counter below. Still smiling, his face started turning pink… and then red… his eyes started bulging from their sockets, and he began gritting his teeth so hard that I could hear them grinding behind his smile. Suddenly, he slammed his hand down against the counter, rattling the coins and flattening the bills I had placed.

“This isn’t a bank… sir.” The man said through gritted teeth, still trying to hold his smile.

“I’m just trying to count exact change for you. I know you need exac—”

He cut me off again before I could finish.

“Like I said… This is NOT A BANK……SIR!” His face was now blood-red, and his eyes stared at me with pure vitriol.

“Ok, ok, no problem, man, easy. I don’t want any issues here.”

He stared at me, his hand shaking with anger, clenching the bills on the counter. Then, as quickly as the anger flared, it vanished, replaced by a chilling silence. The old radio had become more apparent now. An old jazz tune had become the background of our staring contest. A slow, almost predatory smile spread across his face before he spoke.

""You know too much,"" he remarked, his voice dangerously gleeful.

“What? What do you mean I know too much?” I asked, full of confusion.

“Have a wonderful day, sir, and remember, don’t nix it, Gene can fix it!” He answered, not acknowledging my question.

I turned to leave. As I made it outside the store doors, I looked back through the window. There, I saw Gene still standing behind the counter, that same smile plastered on his face, staring at me as I walked down the steps.

The next night, just after midnight, I heard footsteps crunching outside my window. I grabbed a flashlight and my revolver from the bedside drawer. I was in bear country, and I did not want to become dinner for whatever was out there. My heart pounded as I crept through the cabin, following the sound of the footsteps as they crunched toward the front door. The more I listened, the more they sounded like someone walking. This was no bear… it was a person. The sounds were now coming from right outside… heavy footsteps creaked across the slats on the front porch. I grabbed the door handle and, with a deep breath, swung the door open. As the door opened, I clicked the flashlight on and leveled the revolver in the middle of the beam. I scanned the porch and the surrounding area, but there was nothing… Nothing but shadows and silence. The idea of a person skulking around my cabin did not sit too well with me, especially in these hills… especially with how everyone has been acting.

The next couple of nights were more of the same. I would hear footsteps approach my window at midnight, creeping their way around the cabin until they drew me to the front door. I foolishly took the bait every time, looking like an idiot standing on my porch with nothing but boxers, a Maglite, and my dad’s old .38 revolver.

That Friday, I headed back into town to do my weekly grocery run, no matter how much I dreaded it. I knew Jimmy was going to give me shit, no matter if I had exact change or not. I learned my lesson quickly on the cash-only request. I received my groceries and endured Jimmy’s hate-filled eyes as I paid and made my way out to my truck. I loaded the groceries into the Bronco and started to hop into the driver’s seat when a wild thought struck me. I decided that, instead of getting in the Bronco and driving straight home, I was going to take a walk around town and take in the cool weather that was starting to roll in. I needed some time away from the cabin.

I walked down toward the center of town where the town hall sat. I rounded the turn on Quincy Street, head down, pondering the curiosity of this place, when suddenly, I was struck hard in the shoulder by what felt like a semi. I was sent flying, eventually crashing to the ground in a heap. As I lay on the ground trying to get my bearings, I heard a deep, raspy voice ask,

“Whoa there, boy! You ok?”

Still dazed, I couldn’t respond to the question yet.

“Sorry bout that, son… Don’t see as well as I used to. Sometimes I just run right into shit and not even know it... hehehe.”

I finally gathered my wits about me and looked up at the man. He was tall and lean, his face weathered like bark, eyes sharp but cloudy, like they had seen things no human should ever see. He wore an old pair of overalls with a red shirt underneath and a straw hat that looked like it had seen better days.

“Yeah, I’m ok. I should’ve been looking when I came around that corner.” I replied.

“Heh, no worries, son. These days everybody is on that damn phone looking at stupid shit nobody cares about. It happens more times than you think.”

I laughed as the old man helped me up. His lips and skin looked parched and worn, like an old leather satchel, and he had one brown tooth that stuck out when he spoke.

“The name’s Tom. Tom Sheffield.” He boomed. “And you are?”

He stuck out his hand for a handshake.

“Elias… Elias Smith.” I responded, grabbing the man’s calloused hand.

With a firm grip, he shook my hand and shot me a half-smile.

“Where ya headed, son?” He asked.

“Well… I was just walking around a bit… but I guess I’m gonna head on back to my truck.” I responded.

“Well good, I’ll walk with ya. It ain’t every day I get to talk to someone new, ya know?”

“Ehh… That’s ok, I don’t want to interrupt your day.” I said in return.

“Nonsense, I need to stretch out the ol’ legs anyway hehe.”

Tom walked with me back to my truck even as I protested. I was already on the bad side of most people in town for reasons I didn’t understand… I didn’t need to owe anybody any favors or piss anybody off. As we walked, he kept a happy and carefree demeanor. We talked the entire way back.

“When’d you move to town?” he asked, his smile slightly fading from his face.

“I’ve been here about a month or so. I like the place, but some of these people are just… strange.” I replied.

He gave a slight nod and looked forward as if he knew exactly what I was talking about. As we approached my truck, he pulled out a pack of cigarettes and stuck one between his weathered lips and spoke.

“Well, son, this town has some strange history. Hell, I live here and still don’t understand it.”

He took a drag on his cigarette.

“I lived close to here as a boy ‘til I got sent to Vietnam. I wasn’t much the same after I came back from that. I had some… issues at home when I got back and had to move here. I never felt like this place was home for me. I’ve only lived here for ten years myself.”

He took another drag, squinting his eyes as the smoke encircled the brim of his hat.

“This town’s got its layers,” he said, voice rough. “People like to keep the surface smooth, but underneath... things aren’t so simple.”

“What kind of things?” I asked.

He flicked ash onto the ground.

“Things that people don’t like to talk about.” He answered. “Now you get your gear and head on home before it gets dark. These roads get dangerous at night.”

He took one more long drag off his cigarette and flicked it to the ground, stamping it out with his boot.

“You take care now, ya hear? Nice meetin’ you, Elias. I’ll be seein’ ya.”

The man walked back the way he came, leaving me with more questions than answers. Confused, I climbed into the Bronco and made my way back home.

That night, I lay awake, listening to the wind twisting through the trees. Tom’s words swirled in my mind.

“What did he mean by layers?” I asked myself. “And what don’t these people want to talk about? What is so secretive?”

The thoughts raced through my skull as I lay in bed, trying not to think about the footsteps actively crunching around the cabin’s perimeter. Indigo Falls was no longer my safe haven… It had become a cage.",2,1749166864.0,creepcast,3,1.0,False

**Part 1: New Roots**

The gravel crunched under the tires as I pulled into the cabin driveway. My old Bronco rattled over the uneven ground as I glanced up at the place I hoped would be my salvation. A cabin, weathered by time and the harsh northern winters, stood quietly at the edge of a dense forest. When I saw it online, I could not have dreamt a more perfect place for my tired soul… but now that I was here, it seemed less appealing than I had imagined. Moss climbed the stairs. Tree roots tangled around the foundation like veins. I ran my hand over the cracked wood of the porch railing, feeling its roughness beneath my fingertips. No matter how dilapidated the house looked, it was vastly different compared to the savage streets of Detroit.

It has been 33 long years since the day my mother died from pushing me out of the womb, and I can still feel her pain as if it were my own. I ran away from that pain for so many years, trying desperately to feel anything else. I spent every cent I had ever earned on drugs, cheap booze, and fuel for the road. I have been running for so long, and yet, gnawing at me was a voice telling me to slow down... That there was a place for me out there somewhere. That is when I saw my way out. Nestled in the rolling hills of Northern West Virginia was a small log cabin for sale. The listing offered beautiful landscapes and a quiet 10-acre lot for the ridiculously low price of $115,000. For that much of a deal, I could not pass it up. I gathered the money I had left in my account from my inheritance, loaded up my ’79 Bronco, and headed toward my new home.

This was it… A chance to escape. To bury my past. To finally breathe.

I’d spent years on the road… weeks spent in cheap motels; nights filled with regrets and a numbness I couldn’t shake. But this place, this wild patch of land surrounded by towering pines and ancient oaks, felt different. Raw and untouched. Alive.

The air was sharp with pine and earth, the scent of rain lingering on the breeze. I inhaled deeply, chest tightening against the clean air. It was fresh and calm… but seemed to have something attached to it. Something I couldn’t quite make out. I unpacked my bags from the Bronco… the last material thing I owned from a past life. A life that I wanted to forget.

The quaint little cabin sat just beyond the town of Indigo Falls… a small dot on the map. A sleepy little West Virginia town that boasted only a small cluster of buildings that were barely visible from the highway. There were a few trucks, a general store, and a diner with a flickering neon sign that spelled out “Harlan’s” in tired pink letters.

The first three days blurred into quiet routines… time spent unpacking boxes, stacking wood, and exploring the thick woods that surrounded the cabin became the norm. The forest was both comforting and unsettling. Every crack of a branch underfoot echoed in the silence of the meadows and clearings. Shadows shifted just beyond the edge of the trees, as if you always had someone with you. The wind blowing through the canopy sounded like whispers flowing along in the breeze.

At night, the forest pulsed with life. Owls hooted, insects droned, and something deeper stirred... something strange... Something I didn’t understand, and yet, I didn’t care to. This place was paradise from what I had come from and endured. A little oddity here and there wasn’t going to scare me off.

On my fourth day in town, after a vigorous morning of chores, hunger and curiosity led me to the diner. I drove down the hill and across the covered bridge that connects the rolling hills with the center of town. Crossing over the small speed bump that separated dirt from asphalt, I spotted a sign that read “Indigo Falls – Population: 48”. This place was amazing. The roads had no red lights or even stop signs. The only cautionary measure was a yellow caution light that blinked intermittently at the center of town. I pulled into the diner’s parking lot and secured a spot. Harlan’s Diner was a squat brick building with chipped paint and windows fogged by steam. The place was packed. It looked like every person in town was having breakfast at the same time. The bell above the door jingled as I stepped inside. The smell hit me instantly... bacon grease, strong coffee, and something metallic, faint but unmistakable… the griddle, sizzling with eggs and bacon covering every inch.

The diner was full, aside from an open seat here and there. Old men and women occupied the creaking metal bar stools that lined the counter. They sat nursing their black coffee and folded newspapers, occasionally chatting with one another. Their conversations were low, punctuated by laughter that didn’t quite reach their eyes. As the door closed behind me, ringing the bell once more, all heads turned… not in hostility, but in awareness. They didn’t know me, and they wanted me to feel that. The silence was deafening as my feet froze to the sticky linoleum floor. I could feel every set of eyes on me like red-hot fire pokers jabbing at my soul.

Behind the counter was a woman. Her red hair was pulled back in a loose knot, strands falling over her face. She looked up and smiled, the kind of smile that someone gives as forced pleasantry.

“Don’t just stand there, come on in,” she said in a sweet, inviting tone.

I stumbled awkwardly as I turned in her direction and shuffled over to an open stool.

“New in town?” she asked, her voice warm but tired.

“Yeah,” I said, sliding onto the stool. “Moved into the cabin outside town a few days ago.”

She nodded. “I’m Clarice, but everybody here calls me Clara, hence the nametag.”

She pointed to her shirt at a patch that had “Clara” stitched in black thread.

“My name’s Elias Smith.”

She wiped her hands on a rag and poured me a black coffee.

“Well… Elias Smith…” She said in a playful, teasing way. “You’ll find it’s quiet here. Too quiet, some say.”

I let out a small laugh.

“Why do you say that?” I asked as I took a sip of my coffee.

“Well, some folks don’t like to be bothered… especially around here.”

She shot a glance over at an old man who was peering across the top of his newspaper at us. I glanced, following her eyes over to the man. As my eyes met his, he ducked behind his newspaper once more.

“Hmmm… Well, I guess I can’t say I blame them.” I responded, turning my head back around to meet Clara’s eyes.

“Don’t worry about that old grouch.” She said in a playful tone. “He just needs another cup of coffee.”

She shot another glance at the man, yet he didn’t reveal his face from behind the paper this time. She focused back on my face as she spoke to me,

“So, whatcha want for breakfast, hon?”

The rest of the morning was spent in playful conversation with Clara, the cute, red-haired woman who seemed to be sent here just for me.

Clara felt completely different from the people in town. She was kind and warm. A person who was gentle and understanding in such a way that you could talk to her about anything. Over the next few days, I finished the arduous move-in process. My reward was enjoying Clara’s company at Harlan’s with a strong cup of coffee and a hearty breakfast.

 I had been in town for only a week, but it felt like I had been here for decades with Clara behind the counter. She had become my beacon of hope in a place that I still wasn’t sure of yet.

“So…. You never told me where you were originally from.” Clara said with a curious look.

“Hmph… yeah, that is a story too long to tell over just a coffee.” I half-chuckled in response.

She leaned over the counter close to me, almost touching my ear with her lips, and in a half-whisper said,

“Well, I keep a bottle of Four Roses back here for when things get slow. Ya wanna get loaded and do naughty stuff behind the dumpsters out back?”

I choked on my coffee, and my face immediately turned red. She giggled, knowing that she had tripped me up with that comment.

“Hahaha, just messing... but seriously... I want to know more about you, Elias.”

“Ok… well, you can come up to my cabin if you’d like. It’s just outside of town, across the covered bridge, up past Grist Mill Road.” I responded confidently. “I can give you the address and you can come by when you get off… if that’s ok, of course…”

“Haha, that sounds perfect, honey.” She said with a smile.

Looking into her beautiful green eyes, I was captured… mesmerized by her beauty. I couldn’t believe where I had found myself. I found this place by accident… It was a pipedream I thought would never be achieved… and yet, another part of me felt like I was owed this life. I had been through hell to get here, and it was time for a change.

From the moment I met Clara, time seemed to fly by. Over the next week, Clara and I settled into a rhythm. Mornings at Harlan’s, sharing late breakfasts. Sometimes she’d take me on slow walks near the edge of the woods, pointing out plants and telling stories about the town’s history. Over that time, I told her all about my mom and her side of the family. I told her about the times I shared with people on the road and what city life was like back in Detroit. We talked freely with one another, but we both felt like the other was holding something back… hiding something.

At the beginning of my third week in town, Clara got off early and met me outside my cabin for a hike. We had become remarkably close over the last couple of weeks. As usual, this was our time to talk and decompress in the beautiful West Virginia hills. We walked down the forest trails, combing through the ins and outs of small-town life. As we walked, Clara grabbed my arm and snuggled in close to my side.

“So, tell me about your dad. You’ve told me all about your mom and her side, but you haven’t mentioned your dad much at all,” she said, giving me a confused look.

“Yeah, that’s a sore subject. It’s one of those things that I would like to just lock away and forget, you know what I mean?”

“I do… but you know we talk about everything, Eli. I want to know everything about you.” She said, smiling at me and pushing her cheek into my shoulder.

“I guess so…” I muttered in return.

“Well… are you gonna tell me?” she asked, pressing a little further.

I couldn’t resist Clara’s charm. She was my kryptonite. I had only known her for a matter of a few weeks, but it felt like so much more.

 “Ahem…” I choked up a little as I started to talk, “Well, it starts back when I was just a baby.” I paused, knowing that this part of my life was so traumatic, so intense that I had literally compressed it into a little ball and pushed it as far back into my mind as I could, hoping that it would die and rot away without ever resurfacing again. I continued, fighting the urge to bury it again, “My dad was a heavy drinker and a very mean person… As a child, my brother and I only knew beatings and pain. We would get beat for being late to school… beat for being late to dinner… hell, we even got beat for not crying when we got beat.”

“Oh my God, that is awful! I am so sorry, Elias. I didn’t know it was like that for you.” She said in a troubled and mournful tone.

“It’s ok. That drunk bastard killed himself with a 12-gauge during the Super Bowl about 16 years ago, so he got what was coming to him.” I said coldly.

“Jesus! He committed suicide in front of you!?” she asked, searching my face intently for the answer.

“No… my brother and I weren’t home… and it wasn’t a suicide. He was trying to shoot the neighbor's cat in our yard and dropped the gun while trying to open the window. Boom… just like that, he ended my nightmare… and my brother’s.”

She paused, not yet knowing what to say. Feeling the tension from the moment, I tried to lighten it by adding what I considered “the good part.”

“Well… It wasn’t all bad. My grandpa made a lot of money in the stock market before the dotcom crash in 2000. He died a couple of years later and left it to my dad. Since he didn’t have a will, my brother Josh and I received it as an inheritance when he died and split it. So, I guess the good thing about it is that I don’t have to worry about money anymore hehe.” I gave a slight chuckle, trying to relax the mood.

“Where is your brother now?” she asked.

“Last I heard, he had joined the army and was stationed in Fort Benning. He always wanted to be in the army. He was always talking about how he wanted to make a difference and jump out of planes. I never really understood it, but it made him happy.”

“At least he is doing something that he likes.” She responded.

“Yeah… I guess so.”

We walked a little further down the trail, silent. The conversation weighed heavily in the air between us. As the sun started to fall, she finally spoke up again.

“The Harvest Festival is coming up soon,” she said, kicking at the gravel on the trailside. “It’s the biggest event Indigo Falls has. Everyone will be there. It’s a... tradition.”

“What kind of tradition?” I asked.

She hesitated, eyes flicking to the woods.

“Old stories. Old songs. You’ll see… Will you go with me?” she asked, looking up at me with her intoxicating green eyes.

“Of course I will!” I responded quickly.

The walks I had with Clara were renewing my soul little by little. Each time we were together, I could feel a powerful warmth wash over me, and then I became calm. The townsfolk, however, weren’t as welcoming as she was. I stopped by the grocery store after mine and Clara’s hike to grab a few things for dinner. When I came through the door, I could see Jimmy, the clerk, standing behind the counter.

Since I had moved in, he was always there, no matter the time of day. It seemed like all Jimmy did was work. As I walked by him, I nodded in his direction with a half-smile. He barely looked at me. He was a nice guy, by my estimation. The times I had come in before, he was pleasant and helpful. Something was different this time… something was wrong.

“Whatcha need?” he said with a monotonous groan.

“A few things,” I said. “Just a few essentials for next week.”

He shoved the items across the counter, making no eye contact. When I tried to make conversation, he would cut me off or ask an abrupt question.

“That all?” he asked, his expression becoming more irritated.

“Y-Yea I guess so...” I replied.

“Good, that’ll be $36.78. Cash only.”

Caught off guard by this, I quickly reached into my pocket, fumbling for the bills. He had never done this before. He always lets me use my debit card. Why was he asking for cash only? When I pulled my hand out, all I had was a 20 and a 10, accompanied by a wad of matted pocket lint. I held the money up toward Jimmy, mouth slightly agape, as if I were a mute asking if this would be enough with just my facial expression. His brow furrowed. With a violent rush, he sprang toward me and grabbed my jacket, pulling me close to him.

“Is this some kind of sick joke, buddy?” he snarled in my face.

“Wh-What do you mean? I-I’m just trying to pay for my groceries. Look, here’s cash. It’s all I have on me right now.”

“Ha! You know damn well that ain’t what I said. I SAID, THIRTY-SIX DOLLARS AND SEVENTY-EIGHT CENTS… NOT THIRTY, YOU FUCKING IDIOT!” He screamed in my face. “IF YOU DON’T HAVE THE MONEY, THEN GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY STORE!”

He pushed me away from him while releasing my jacket. I stood stunned for a moment. I had never had anyone in town act like this toward me, especially not Jimmy. He stared at me, red-faced, veins popping from his neck, fuming over the audacity of my ignorance. The fact that I came in to buy groceries without exact change was inconceivable to him. As I stumbled out of the store empty-handed, all I could do was think about how this place felt… different… changed in some way.

The air in town felt charged... like I’d walked into a spider’s web and the spiders were watching me, waiting. I noticed people stopping their conversations when I approached. The few kids on the playground would fall silent and glance away. Older women eyed me over knitting needles, their fingers tightening involuntarily, knuckles turning white from the force. It felt like I was becoming an outcast in a place that just weeks ago was my refuge. It felt like everybody was starting to hate me for some reason.

The next night, after Clara closed the diner, I invited her to my porch for a few drinks. The sky was a patchwork of stars behind the dark silhouettes of trees. The crickets provided the perfect ambience for her pleasant company.

“Did you hear how Jimmy acted toward me yesterday?” I asked.

“Yeah, it was all he could talk about when he came in for dinner last night.” She responded.

“I had some weird encounters with the folks in town as well… it’s been… strange lately.”

She lowered her head, staring at her glass. She ran her finger around the edge slowly as if she were in a trance.

“Why do you think they act like that?” I asked, taking a sip of a beer.

She looked out into the woods, tracing a pattern on the weathered trees.

“Because they’re scared,” she said softly. “Scared of change… of outsiders. Indigo Falls likes its secrets. It’s how they keep the town... safe and healthy.”

“Safe from what?”

Her eyes met mine, filled with sadness I couldn’t place.

“From what’s in these hills.”

These hills? I pondered… my eyes slowly scanning the darkness.

The more I stared into them, the more they felt alive. I could feel them watching... breathing. Strange sounds echoed in the distance... a low hum… the snap of twigs... not animals, something else. The mystery of the hills around me had become front and center in my mind. I couldn’t place it, but something had shifted in the air, and it was starting to cause my little piece of heaven to crumble right in front of me.

“Is there anything I can do to stop it?” I asked.

“No… these folks have been here a long time… and I do mean a very long time… They don’t like anybody coming in that they don’t know.” She continued. “Every year around the harvest festival, it gets this way. It will pass, and they will get back to normal. It’s just an old tradition that started a long time ago, and people never really let it go.”

My eyes searched her face as she spoke. Her words reassured me. There was nothing that Clara couldn’t fix in my mind. I just had to endure this weird “tradition” of outsider hazing or whatever they wanted to call it, and then hopefully we could get back to normal.

The rest of the night after our conversation was routine. Clara and I spent the evening swapping stories and laughing with one another well into the night. The idea of the hills having secrets stuck with me, however. My mind couldn’t erase the look on Jimmy’s face when he grabbed me. He had true hate in his eyes. I hadn’t seen that look since my dad was alive. I needed to focus on more important things to get my mind off it.

The next day, I made my way down to Gene’s general store to purchase some nails and boards for the cabin. The railing was getting on my nerves and would give me a nasty splinter every time I tried to grab it. Entering the store for the first time, I could hear the tired, old speaker behind the counter playing old music. It sounded like slow jazz… something old. I grabbed my items and approached the counter.

“Good morning, sir. I hope you found what you were looking for.” The man said in an upbeat and jolly tone.

“Umm… Yeah… I did. Do you—”

He cut me off before I could finish asking my question.

“That’ll be $16.25, sir.” He announced with a wide smile.

 “Uh…. Ok… Do you take debit cards?” I asked.

“Tsk… No, I’m afraid not, sir. Cash only here. Sorry about that.” The man responded, clicking his tongue against his teeth.

“No worries, I have some cash on me.” I quickly responded. I had prepared for this scenario ever since the Jimmy situation happened.

I pulled out a handful of bills and began counting the total on the counter. As I counted the bills in front of him, his eyes left my face and slowly rolled down to the counter below. Still smiling, his face started turning pink… and then red… his eyes started bulging from their sockets, and he began gritting his teeth so hard that I could hear them grinding behind his smile. Suddenly, he slammed his hand down against the counter, rattling the coins and flattening the bills I had placed.

“This isn’t a bank… sir.” The man said through gritted teeth, still trying to hold his smile.

“I’m just trying to count exact change for you. I know you need exac—”

He cut me off again before I could finish.

“Like I said… This is NOT A BANK……SIR!” His face was now blood-red, and his eyes stared at me with pure vitriol.

“Ok, ok, no problem, man, easy. I don’t want any issues here.”

He stared at me, his hand shaking with anger, clenching the bills on the counter. Then, as quickly as the anger flared, it vanished, replaced by a chilling silence. The old radio had become more apparent now. An old jazz tune had become the background of our staring contest. A slow, almost predatory smile spread across his face before he spoke.

""You know too much,"" he remarked, his voice dangerously gleeful.

“What? What do you mean I know too much?” I asked, full of confusion.

“Have a wonderful day, sir, and remember, don’t nix it, Gene can fix it!” He answered, not acknowledging my question.

I turned to leave. As I made it outside the store doors, I looked back through the window. There, I saw Gene still standing behind the counter, that same smile plastered on his face, staring at me as I walked down the steps.

The next night, just after midnight, I heard footsteps crunching outside my window. I grabbed a flashlight and my revolver from the bedside drawer. I was in bear country, and I did not want to become dinner for whatever was out there. My heart pounded as I crept through the cabin, following the sound of the footsteps as they crunched toward the front door. The more I listened, the more they sounded like someone walking. This was no bear… it was a person. The sounds were now coming from right outside… heavy footsteps creaked across the slats on the front porch. I grabbed the door handle and, with a deep breath, swung the door open. As the door opened, I clicked the flashlight on and leveled the revolver in the middle of the beam. I scanned the porch and the surrounding area, but there was nothing… Nothing but shadows and silence. The idea of a person skulking around my cabin did not sit too well with me, especially in these hills… especially with how everyone has been acting.

The next couple of nights were more of the same. I would hear footsteps approach my window at midnight, creeping their way around the cabin until they drew me to the front door. I foolishly took the bait every time, looking like an idiot standing on my porch with nothing but boxers, a Maglite, and my dad’s old .38 revolver.

That Friday, I headed back into town to do my weekly grocery run, no matter how much I dreaded it. I knew Jimmy was going to give me shit, no matter if I had exact change or not. I learned my lesson quickly on the cash-only request. I received my groceries and endured Jimmy’s hate-filled eyes as I paid and made my way out to my truck. I loaded the groceries into the Bronco and started to hop into the driver’s seat when a wild thought struck me. I decided that, instead of getting in the Bronco and driving straight home, I was going to take a walk around town and take in the cool weather that was starting to roll in. I needed some time away from the cabin.

I walked down toward the center of town where the town hall sat. I rounded the turn on Quincy Street, head down, pondering the curiosity of this place, when suddenly, I was struck hard in the shoulder by what felt like a semi. I was sent flying, eventually crashing to the ground in a heap. As I lay on the ground trying to get my bearings, I heard a deep, raspy voice ask,

“Whoa there, boy! You ok?”

Still dazed, I couldn’t respond to the question yet.

“Sorry bout that, son… Don’t see as well as I used to. Sometimes I just run right into shit and not even know it... hehehe.”

I finally gathered my wits about me and looked up at the man. He was tall and lean, his face weathered like bark, eyes sharp but cloudy, like they had seen things no human should ever see. He wore an old pair of overalls with a red shirt underneath and a straw hat that looked like it had seen better days.

“Yeah, I’m ok. I should’ve been looking when I came around that corner.” I replied.

“Heh, no worries, son. These days everybody is on that damn phone looking at stupid shit nobody cares about. It happens more times than you think.”

I laughed as the old man helped me up. His lips and skin looked parched and worn, like an old leather satchel, and he had one brown tooth that stuck out when he spoke.

“The name’s Tom. Tom Sheffield.” He boomed. “And you are?”

He stuck out his hand for a handshake.

“Elias… Elias Smith.” I responded, grabbing the man’s calloused hand.

With a firm grip, he shook my hand and shot me a half-smile.

“Where ya headed, son?” He asked.

“Well… I was just walking around a bit… but I guess I’m gonna head on back to my truck.” I responded.

“Well good, I’ll walk with ya. It ain’t every day I get to talk to someone new, ya know?”

“Ehh… That’s ok, I don’t want to interrupt your day.” I said in return.

“Nonsense, I need to stretch out the ol’ legs anyway hehe.”

Tom walked with me back to my truck even as I protested. I was already on the bad side of most people in town for reasons I didn’t understand… I didn’t need to owe anybody any favors or piss anybody off. As we walked, he kept a happy and carefree demeanor. We talked the entire way back.

“When’d you move to town?” he asked, his smile slightly fading from his face.

“I’ve been here about a month or so. I like the place, but some of these people are just… strange.” I replied.

He gave a slight nod and looked forward as if he knew exactly what I was talking about. As we approached my truck, he pulled out a pack of cigarettes and stuck one between his weathered lips and spoke.

“Well, son, this town has some strange history. Hell, I live here and still don’t understand it.”

He took a drag on his cigarette.

“I lived close to here as a boy ‘til I got sent to Vietnam. I wasn’t much the same after I came back from that. I had some… issues at home when I got back and had to move here. I never felt like this place was home for me. I’ve only lived here for ten years myself.”

He took another drag, squinting his eyes as the smoke encircled the brim of his hat.

“This town’s got its layers,” he said, voice rough. “People like to keep the surface smooth, but underneath... things aren’t so simple.”

“What kind of things?” I asked.

He flicked ash onto the ground.

“Things that people don’t like to talk about.” He answered. “Now you get your gear and head on home before it gets dark. These roads get dangerous at night.”

He took one more long drag off his cigarette and flicked it to the ground, stamping it out with his boot.

“You take care now, ya hear? Nice meetin’ you, Elias. I’ll be seein’ ya.”

The man walked back the way he came, leaving me with more questions than answers. Confused, I climbed into the Bronco and made my way back home.

That night, I lay awake, listening to the wind twisting through the trees. Tom’s words swirled in my mind.

“What did he mean by layers?” I asked myself. “And what don’t these people want to talk about? What is so secretive?”

The thoughts raced through my skull as I lay in bed, trying not to think about the footsteps actively crunching around the cabin’s perimeter. Indigo Falls was no longer my safe haven… It had become a cage.",1,1749166785.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

1l4e2rt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1l4e2rt/iso_recommendations_of_supplements_to_add_to_help/,ISO recommendations of supplements to add to help further with brain fog and inflammation,"I am a long time lurker, posting for the first time. I come here seeking further help fine tuning my regimen and I am including my history because I think it’s relevant and it may help someone else. My goal is to get out of this terrible brain fog I’ve been experiencing since 2020/2021. While a lot of what I’m doing has helped significantly, I still don’t quite feel like myself in my brain space. Also wanting recommendations on reducing systemic inflammation (wanting to do an anti-inflammatory diet soon).

My history: I’m an obese 37 yo woman with medically diagnosed ADD and diagnosed BVD (by a neuro-optometrist). Seems like I had Hep A around 2016-2017 and I was unaware, that’s around the time my “IBS” started. I developed a gluten sensitivity around this same time (found using Low FODMAP diet which is basically a very specific kind of elimination diet). Had a colonoscopy in 2023 and I had h. Pylori for which I took meds for but nothing else came up. Also, was recently diagnosed with a severe vitamin D deficiency and I have struggled with anemia since my teens due to heavy periods—or at least this is what I’ve always been told. 

I have also had 2 more recent pregnancies around the time my brain fog got really bad. One in 2019 and another in 2020. Had my gall bladder removed in 2020 after I had the last baby.

Probably irrelevant, but I have recurrent issues with my feet. I have plantar fasciitis and this time around I have a bursitis that is so very painful —I tried to wear some boots recently and I nearly passed out from the pain trying to put my feet in them.

I am taking the following and I try to take the majority of them with meals and I cycle through some of them.

Beef liver supplements: I take for around a week before my period. Newer addition. Seems to be helping to get my ferritin up.

Methylated B12 and L methyl folate (I love the triquetra brand)- has helped tremendously with getting my anemia under control and is slowly increasing my ferritin. Also, mysteriously helping with my gluten sensitivity? Been on this one for around a year or more and I stopped for 3 months and my gluten sensitivity got worse around this time. If anyone has some scientific insight to explain why it might help with my gluten sensitivity, I’d love to hear it!

B1 Thiamine: newer addition that is doing wonders for intestinal motility and keeping me from feeling bloated all the time, esp when I’m not properly avoiding gluten.

Vitamin D 10k IU: every other day. Dr monitors closely. This is not a supplement to be played with.  I feel like my mental acuity is slowly returning and I almost feel like my old, whitty, intelligent self.

Magnesium glycinate with L theanine (Sam’s brand is amazing and dirt cheap): helps absorb vitamin d. I take it 30-60 min before bed. My rem has improved from a yearly average of 17% to 24-30% average for the past 3 months. One of the biggest things that has helped with a lot of my brain fog. These days I’ve taken it with B1, and I notice my sleep is more restful and I simply don’t have to sleep as long. This one I’ve been on for 6-8 months.  I don’t take it every single day. ADD is good for that lol But at the same time it’s good to cycle supplements and the effectiveness hasn’t diminished.

Collagen peptides: take most mornings with my coffee (maybe I should ditch the coffee). Gives my skin a boost. Nails grow fast. Joints (other than my feet 😭but that seems to be mostly inflammation) don’t seem to be deteriorating. I rarely skip this one.

Osteo biflex: family history of rheumatoid arthritis so I try to nourish my joints as much as possible. I also have some minor aches and pains and a knee injury. They say notice a difference in 7 days—I noticed a diff in 4 days. It works.

Fish oil (Nordic Brand is my fav)- This makes a huge difference in my cognition. When I run out and don’t refill asap it takes me near 3 weeks to get back to where I was. That DHA really does wonders for the brain.

PRISM LENSES- I got glasses for my BVD about a year ago and they have been life changing for a constant feeling of vertigo-like symptoms. Has helped a lot with anxiety in wide open spaces like grocery stores, amusement parks, airports etc. 

There’s 2-3 more I take on occasion, but I don’t take them often enough to say they’re actually doing much for me.

To answer your question: I don’t notice more or less brain fog with certain foods. Quick story about the vitamin d deficiency; I had a big Mexican meal for lunch one day and I had that after meal slump really bad and I feel like I just never recovered from that meal? I felt so weak for days. Felt dizziness when I stood up. I went to the doctor and ran multiple labs and that’s how we found my vitamin d deficiency. I’m glad I insisted. It has really helped my brain functioning.",0,1749166706.0,Supplements,1,0.25,False
1l4e1g3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l4e1g3/moving_to_indigo_falls_saved_my_life_staying/,Moving to Indigo Falls Saved My Life... Staying Almost Cost It. (PART I of V),"The gravel crunched under the tires as I pulled into the cabin driveway. My old Bronco rattled over the uneven ground as I glanced up at the place I hoped would be my salvation. A cabin, weathered by time and the harsh northern winters, stood quietly at the edge of a dense forest. When I saw it online, I could not have dreamt a more perfect place for my tired soul… but now that I was here, it seemed less appealing than I had imagined. Moss climbed the stairs. Tree roots tangled around the foundation like veins. I ran my hand over the cracked wood of the porch railing, feeling its roughness beneath my fingertips. No matter how dilapidated the house looked, it was vastly different compared to the savage streets of Detroit.

It has been 33 long years since the day my mother died from pushing me out of the womb, and I can still feel her pain as if it were my own. I ran away from that pain for so many years, trying desperately to feel anything else. I spent every cent I had ever earned on drugs, cheap booze, and fuel for the road. I have been running for so long, and yet, gnawing at me was a voice telling me to slow down... That there was a place for me out there somewhere. That is when I saw my way out. Nestled in the rolling hills of Northern West Virginia was a small log cabin for sale. The listing offered beautiful landscapes and a quiet 10-acre lot for the ridiculously low price of $115,000. For that much of a deal, I could not pass it up. I gathered the money I had left in my account from my inheritance, loaded up my ’79 Bronco, and headed toward my new home.

This was it… A chance to escape. To bury my past. To finally breathe.

I’d spent years on the road… weeks spent in cheap motels; nights filled with regrets and a numbness I couldn’t shake. But this place, this wild patch of land surrounded by towering pines and ancient oaks, felt different. Raw and untouched. Alive.

The air was sharp with pine and earth, the scent of rain lingering on the breeze. I inhaled deeply, chest tightening against the clean air. It was fresh and calm… but seemed to have something attached to it. Something I couldn’t quite make out. I unpacked my bags from the Bronco… the last material thing I owned from a past life. A life that I wanted to forget.

The quaint little cabin sat just beyond the town of Indigo Falls… a small dot on the map. A sleepy little West Virginia town that boasted only a small cluster of buildings that were barely visible from the highway. There were a few trucks, a general store, and a diner with a flickering neon sign that spelled out “Harlan’s” in tired pink letters.

The first three days blurred into quiet routines… time spent unpacking boxes, stacking wood, and exploring the thick woods that surrounded the cabin became the norm. The forest was both comforting and unsettling. Every crack of a branch underfoot echoed in the silence of the meadows and clearings. Shadows shifted just beyond the edge of the trees, as if you always had someone with you. The wind blowing through the canopy sounded like whispers flowing along in the breeze.

At night, the forest pulsed with life. Owls hooted, insects droned, and something deeper stirred... something strange... Something I didn’t understand, and yet, I didn’t care to. This place was paradise from what I had come from and endured. A little oddity here and there wasn’t going to scare me off.

On my fourth day in town, after a vigorous morning of chores, hunger and curiosity led me to the diner. I drove down the hill and across the covered bridge that connects the rolling hills with the center of town. Crossing over the small speed bump that separated dirt from asphalt, I spotted a sign that read “Indigo Falls – Population: 48”. This place was amazing. The roads had no red lights or even stop signs. The only cautionary measure was a yellow caution light that blinked intermittently at the center of town. I pulled into the diner’s parking lot and secured a spot. Harlan’s Diner was a squat brick building with chipped paint and windows fogged by steam. The place was packed. It looked like every person in town was having breakfast at the same time. The bell above the door jingled as I stepped inside. The smell hit me instantly... bacon grease, strong coffee, and something metallic, faint but unmistakable… the griddle, sizzling with eggs and bacon covering every inch.

The diner was full, aside from an open seat here and there. Old men and women occupied the creaking metal bar stools that lined the counter. They sat nursing their black coffee and folded newspapers, occasionally chatting with one another. Their conversations were low, punctuated by laughter that didn’t quite reach their eyes. As the door closed behind me, ringing the bell once more, all heads turned… not in hostility, but in awareness. They didn’t know me, and they wanted me to feel that. The silence was deafening as my feet froze to the sticky linoleum floor. I could feel every set of eyes on me like red-hot fire pokers jabbing at my soul.

Behind the counter was a woman. Her red hair was pulled back in a loose knot, strands falling over her face. She looked up and smiled, the kind of smile that someone gives as forced pleasantry.

“Don’t just stand there, come on in,” she said in a sweet, inviting tone.

I stumbled awkwardly as I turned in her direction and shuffled over to an open stool.

“New in town?” she asked, her voice warm but tired.

“Yeah,” I said, sliding onto the stool. “Moved into the cabin outside town a few days ago.”

She nodded. “I’m Clarice, but everybody here calls me Clara, hence the nametag.”

She pointed to her shirt at a patch that had “Clara” stitched in black thread.

“My name’s Elias Smith.”

She wiped her hands on a rag and poured me a black coffee.

“Well… Elias Smith…” She said in a playful, teasing way. “You’ll find it’s quiet here. Too quiet, some say.”

I let out a small laugh.

“Why do you say that?” I asked as I took a sip of my coffee.

“Well, some folks don’t like to be bothered… especially around here.”

She shot a glance over at an old man who was peering across the top of his newspaper at us. I glanced, following her eyes over to the man. As my eyes met his, he ducked behind his newspaper once more.

“Hmmm… Well, I guess I can’t say I blame them.” I responded, turning my head back around to meet Clara’s eyes.

“Don’t worry about that old grouch.” She said in a playful tone. “He just needs another cup of coffee.”

She shot another glance at the man, yet he didn’t reveal his face from behind the paper this time. She focused back on my face as she spoke to me,

“So, whatcha want for breakfast, hon?”

The rest of the morning was spent in playful conversation with Clara, the cute, red-haired woman who seemed to be sent here just for me.

Clara felt completely different from the people in town. She was kind and warm. A person who was gentle and understanding in such a way that you could talk to her about anything. Over the next few days, I finished the arduous move-in process. My reward was enjoying Clara’s company at Harlan’s with a strong cup of coffee and a hearty breakfast. 

I had been in town for only a week, but it felt like I had been here for decades with Clara behind the counter. She had become my beacon of hope in a place that I still wasn’t sure of yet.

“So…. You never told me where you were originally from.” Clara said with a curious look.

“Hmph… yeah, that is a story too long to tell over just a coffee.” I half-chuckled in response.

She leaned over the counter close to me, almost touching my ear with her lips, and in a half-whisper said,

“Well, I keep a bottle of Four Roses back here for when things get slow. Ya wanna get loaded and do naughty stuff behind the dumpsters out back?”

I choked on my coffee, and my face immediately turned red. She giggled, knowing that she had tripped me up with that comment.

“Hahaha, just messing... but seriously... I want to know more about you, Elias.”

“Ok… well, you can come up to my cabin if you’d like. It’s just outside of town, across the covered bridge, up past Grist Mill Road.” I responded confidently. “I can give you the address and you can come by when you get off… if that’s ok, of course…”

“Haha, that sounds perfect, honey.” She said with a smile.

Looking into her beautiful green eyes, I was captured… mesmerized by her beauty. I couldn’t believe where I had found myself. I found this place by accident… It was a pipedream I thought would never be achieved… and yet, another part of me felt like I was owed this life. I had been through hell to get here, and it was time for a change.

From the moment I met Clara, time seemed to fly by. Over the next week, Clara and I settled into a rhythm. Mornings at Harlan’s, sharing late breakfasts. Sometimes she’d take me on slow walks near the edge of the woods, pointing out plants and telling stories about the town’s history. Over that time, I told her all about my mom and her side of the family. I told her about the times I shared with people on the road and what city life was like back in Detroit. We talked freely with one another, but we both felt like the other was holding something back… hiding something.

At the beginning of my third week in town, Clara got off early and met me outside my cabin for a hike. We had become remarkably close over the last couple of weeks. As usual, this was our time to talk and decompress in the beautiful West Virginia hills. We walked down the forest trails, combing through the ins and outs of small-town life. As we walked, Clara grabbed my arm and snuggled in close to my side.

“So, tell me about your dad. You’ve told me all about your mom and her side, but you haven’t mentioned your dad much at all,” she said, giving me a confused look.

“Yeah, that’s a sore subject. It’s one of those things that I would like to just lock away and forget, you know what I mean?”

“I do… but you know we talk about everything, Eli. I want to know everything about you.” She said, smiling at me and pushing her cheek into my shoulder.

“I guess so…” I muttered in return.

“Well… are you gonna tell me?” she asked, pressing a little further.

I couldn’t resist Clara’s charm. She was my kryptonite. I had only known her for a matter of a few weeks, but it felt like so much more.

 “Ahem…” I choked up a little as I started to talk, “Well, it starts back when I was just a baby.” I paused, knowing that this part of my life was so traumatic, so intense that I had literally compressed it into a little ball and pushed it as far back into my mind as I could, hoping that it would die and rot away without ever resurfacing again. I continued, fighting the urge to bury it again, “My dad was a heavy drinker and a very mean person… As a child, my brother and I only knew beatings and pain. We would get beat for being late to school… beat for being late to dinner… hell, we even got beat for not crying when we got beat.”

“Oh my God, that is awful! I am so sorry, Elias. I didn’t know it was like that for you.” She said in a troubled and mournful tone.

“It’s ok. That drunk bastard killed himself with a 12-gauge during the Super Bowl about 16 years ago, so he got what was coming to him.” I said coldly.

“Jesus! He committed suicide in front of you!?” she asked, searching my face intently for the answer.

“No… my brother and I weren’t home… and it wasn’t a suicide. He was trying to shoot the neighbor's cat in our yard and dropped the gun while trying to open the window. Boom… just like that, he ended my nightmare… and my brother’s.”

She paused, not yet knowing what to say. Feeling the tension from the moment, I tried to lighten it by adding what I considered “the good part.”

“Well… It wasn’t all bad. My grandpa made a lot of money in the stock market before the dotcom crash in 2000. He died a couple of years later and left it to my dad. Since he didn’t have a will, my brother Josh and I received it as an inheritance when he died and split it. So, I guess the good thing about it is that I don’t have to worry about money anymore hehe.” I gave a slight chuckle, trying to relax the mood.

“Where is your brother now?” she asked.

“Last I heard, he had joined the army and was stationed in Fort Benning. He always wanted to be in the army. He was always talking about how he wanted to make a difference and jump out of planes. I never really understood it, but it made him happy.”

“At least he is doing something that he likes.” She responded.

“Yeah… I guess so.”

We walked a little further down the trail, silent. The conversation weighed heavily in the air between us. As the sun started to fall, she finally spoke up again.

“The Harvest Festival is coming up soon,” she said, kicking at the gravel on the trailside. “It’s the biggest event Indigo Falls has. Everyone will be there. It’s a... tradition.”

“What kind of tradition?” I asked.

She hesitated, eyes flicking to the woods.

“Old stories. Old songs. You’ll see… Will you go with me?” she asked, looking up at me with her intoxicating green eyes.

“Of course I will!” I responded quickly.

The walks I had with Clara were renewing my soul little by little. Each time we were together, I could feel a powerful warmth wash over me, and then I became calm. The townsfolk, however, weren’t as welcoming as she was. I stopped by the grocery store after mine and Clara’s hike to grab a few things for dinner. When I came through the door, I could see Jimmy, the clerk, standing behind the counter. 

Since I had moved in, he was always there, no matter the time of day. It seemed like all Jimmy did was work. As I walked by him, I nodded in his direction with a half-smile. He barely looked at me. He was a nice guy, by my estimation. The times I had come in before, he was pleasant and helpful. Something was different this time… something was wrong.

“Whatcha need?” he said with a monotonous groan.

“A few things,” I said. “Just a few essentials for next week.”

He shoved the items across the counter, making no eye contact. When I tried to make conversation, he would cut me off or ask an abrupt question.

“That all?” he asked, his expression becoming more irritated.

“Y-Yea I guess so...” I replied.

“Good, that’ll be $36.78. Cash only.”

Caught off guard by this, I quickly reached into my pocket, fumbling for the bills. He had never done this before. He always lets me use my debit card. Why was he asking for cash only? When I pulled my hand out, all I had was a 20 and a 10, accompanied by a wad of matted pocket lint. I held the money up toward Jimmy, mouth slightly agape, as if I were a mute asking if this would be enough with just my facial expression. His brow furrowed. With a violent rush, he sprang toward me and grabbed my jacket, pulling me close to him.

“Is this some kind of sick joke, buddy?” he snarled in my face.

“Wh-What do you mean? I-I’m just trying to pay for my groceries. Look, here’s cash. It’s all I have on me right now.”

“Ha! You know damn well that ain’t what I said. I SAID, THIRTY-SIX DOLLARS AND SEVENTY-EIGHT CENTS… NOT THIRTY, YOU FUCKING IDIOT!” He screamed in my face. “IF YOU DON’T HAVE THE MONEY, THEN GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY STORE!”

He pushed me away from him while releasing my jacket. I stood stunned for a moment. I had never had anyone in town act like this toward me, especially not Jimmy. He stared at me, red-faced, veins popping from his neck, fuming over the audacity of my ignorance. The fact that I came in to buy groceries without exact change was inconceivable to him. As I stumbled out of the store empty-handed, all I could do was think about how this place felt… different… changed in some way.

The air in town felt charged... like I’d walked into a spider’s web and the spiders were watching me, waiting. I noticed people stopping their conversations when I approached. The few kids on the playground would fall silent and glance away. Older women eyed me over knitting needles, their fingers tightening involuntarily, knuckles turning white from the force. It felt like I was becoming an outcast in a place that just weeks ago was my refuge. It felt like everybody was starting to hate me for some reason.

The next night, after Clara closed the diner, I invited her to my porch for a few drinks. The sky was a patchwork of stars behind the dark silhouettes of trees. The crickets provided the perfect ambience for her pleasant company.

“Did you hear how Jimmy acted toward me yesterday?” I asked.

“Yeah, it was all he could talk about when he came in for dinner last night.” She responded.

“I had some weird encounters with the folks in town as well… it’s been… strange lately.”

She lowered her head, staring at her glass. She ran her finger around the edge slowly as if she were in a trance.

“Why do you think they act like that?” I asked, taking a sip of a beer.

She looked out into the woods, tracing a pattern on the weathered trees.

“Because they’re scared,” she said softly. “Scared of change… of outsiders. Indigo Falls likes its secrets. It’s how they keep the town... safe and healthy.”

“Safe from what?”

Her eyes met mine, filled with sadness I couldn’t place.

“From what’s in these hills.”

These hills? I pondered... my eyes slowly scanning the darkness.

The more I stared into them, the more they felt alive. I could feel them watching... breathing. Strange sounds echoed in the distance... a low hum… the snap of twigs... not animals, something else. The mystery of the hills around me had become front and center in my mind. I couldn’t place it, but something had shifted in the air, and it was starting to cause my little piece of heaven to crumble right in front of me.

“Is there anything I can do to stop it?” I asked.

“No… these folks have been here a long time… and I do mean a very long time… They don’t like anybody coming in that they don’t know.” She continued. “Every year around the harvest festival, it gets this way. It will pass, and they will get back to normal. It’s just an old tradition that started a long time ago, and people never really let it go.”

My eyes searched her face as she spoke. Her words reassured me. There was nothing that Clara couldn’t fix in my mind. I just had to endure this weird “tradition” of outsider hazing or whatever they wanted to call it, and then hopefully we could get back to normal.

The rest of the night after our conversation was routine. Clara and I spent the evening swapping stories and laughing with one another well into the night. The idea of the hills having secrets stuck with me, however. My mind couldn’t erase the look on Jimmy’s face when he grabbed me. He had true hate in his eyes. I hadn’t seen that look since my dad was alive. I needed to focus on more important things to get my mind off it.

The next day, I made my way down to Gene’s general store to purchase some nails and boards for the cabin. The railing was getting on my nerves and would give me a nasty splinter every time I tried to grab it. Entering the store for the first time, I could hear the tired, old speaker behind the counter playing old music. It sounded like slow jazz… something old. I grabbed my items and approached the counter.

“Good morning, sir. I hope you found what you were looking for.” The man said in an upbeat and jolly tone.

“Umm… Yeah… I did. Do you—”

He cut me off before I could finish asking my question.

“That’ll be $16.25, sir.” He announced with a wide smile.

 “Uh…. Ok… Do you take debit cards?” I asked.

“Tsk… No, I’m afraid not, sir. Cash only here. Sorry about that.” The man responded, clicking his tongue against his teeth.

“No worries, I have some cash on me.” I quickly responded. I had prepared for this scenario ever since the Jimmy situation happened.

I pulled out a handful of bills and began counting the total on the counter. As I counted the bills in front of him, his eyes left my face and slowly rolled down to the counter below. Still smiling, his face started turning pink… and then red… his eyes started bulging from their sockets, and he began gritting his teeth so hard that I could hear them grinding behind his smile. Suddenly, he slammed his hand down against the counter, rattling the coins and flattening the bills I had placed.

“This isn’t a bank… sir.” The man said through gritted teeth, still trying to hold his smile.

“I’m just trying to count exact change for you. I know you need exac—”

He cut me off again before I could finish.

“Like I said… This is NOT A BANK……SIR!” His face was now blood-red, and his eyes stared at me with pure vitriol.

“Ok, ok, no problem, man, easy. I don’t want any issues here.”

He stared at me, his hand shaking with anger, clenching the bills on the counter. Then, as quickly as the anger flared, it vanished, replaced by a chilling silence. The old radio had become more apparent now. An old jazz tune had become the background of our staring contest. A slow, almost predatory smile spread across his face before he spoke.

""You know too much,"" he remarked, his voice dangerously gleeful.

“What? What do you mean I know too much?” I asked, full of confusion.

“Have a wonderful day, sir, and remember, don’t nix it, Gene can fix it!” He answered, not acknowledging my question.

I turned to leave. As I made it outside the store doors, I looked back through the window. There, I saw Gene still standing behind the counter, that same smile plastered on his face, staring at me as I walked down the steps.

The next night, just after midnight, I heard footsteps crunching outside my window. I grabbed a flashlight and my revolver from the bedside drawer. I was in bear country, and I did not want to become dinner for whatever was out there. My heart pounded as I crept through the cabin, following the sound of the footsteps as they crunched toward the front door. The more I listened, the more they sounded like someone walking. This was no bear… it was a person. The sounds were now coming from right outside… heavy footsteps creaked across the slats on the front porch. I grabbed the door handle and, with a deep breath, swung the door open. As the door opened, I clicked the flashlight on and leveled the revolver in the middle of the beam. I scanned the porch and the surrounding area, but there was nothing… Nothing but shadows and silence. The idea of a person skulking around my cabin did not sit too well with me, especially in these hills… especially with how everyone has been acting.

The next couple of nights were more of the same. I would hear footsteps approach my window at midnight, creeping their way around the cabin until they drew me to the front door. I foolishly took the bait every time, looking like an idiot standing on my porch with nothing but boxers, a Maglite, and my dad’s old .38 revolver.

That Friday, I headed back into town to do my weekly grocery run, no matter how much I dreaded it. I knew Jimmy was going to give me shit, no matter if I had exact change or not. I learned my lesson quickly on the cash-only request. I received my groceries and endured Jimmy’s hate-filled eyes as I paid and made my way out to my truck. I loaded the groceries into the Bronco and started to hop into the driver’s seat when a wild thought struck me. I decided that, instead of getting in the Bronco and driving straight home, I was going to take a walk around town and take in the cool weather that was starting to roll in. I needed some time away from the cabin. 

I walked down toward the center of town where the town hall sat. I rounded the turn on Quincy Street, head down, pondering the curiosity of this place, when suddenly, I was struck hard in the shoulder by what felt like a semi. I was sent flying, eventually crashing to the ground in a heap. As I lay on the ground trying to get my bearings, I heard a deep, raspy voice ask,

“Whoa there, boy! You ok?”

Still dazed, I couldn’t respond to the question yet.

“Sorry bout that, son… Don’t see as well as I used to. Sometimes I just run right into shit and not even know it... hehehe.”

I finally gathered my wits about me and looked up at the man. He was tall and lean, his face weathered like bark, eyes sharp but cloudy, like they had seen things no human should ever see. He wore an old pair of overalls with a red shirt underneath and a straw hat that looked like it had seen better days.

“Yeah, I’m ok. I should’ve been looking when I came around that corner.” I replied.

“Heh, no worries, son. These days everybody is on that damn phone looking at stupid shit nobody cares about. It happens more times than you think.”

I laughed as the old man helped me up. His lips and skin looked parched and worn, like an old leather satchel, and he had one brown tooth that stuck out when he spoke.

“The name’s Tom. Tom Sheffield.” He boomed. “And you are?”

He stuck out his hand for a handshake.

“Elias… Elias Smith.” I responded, grabbing the man’s calloused hand.

With a firm grip, he shook my hand and shot me a half-smile.

“Where ya headed, son?” He asked.

“Well… I was just walking around a bit… but I guess I’m gonna head on back to my truck.” I responded.

“Well good, I’ll walk with ya. It ain’t every day I get to talk to someone new, ya know?”

“Ehh… That’s ok, I don’t want to interrupt your day.” I said in return.

“Nonsense, I need to stretch out the ol’ legs anyway hehe.”

Tom walked with me back to my truck even as I protested. I was already on the bad side of most people in town for reasons I didn’t understand… I didn’t need to owe anybody any favors or piss anybody off. As we walked, he kept a happy and carefree demeanor. We talked the entire way back.

“When’d you move to town?” he asked, his smile slightly fading from his face.

“I’ve been here about a month or so. I like the place, but some of these people are just… strange.” I replied.

He gave a slight nod and looked forward as if he knew exactly what I was talking about. As we approached my truck, he pulled out a pack of cigarettes and stuck one between his weathered lips and spoke.

“Well, son, this town has some strange history. Hell, I live here and still don’t understand it.”

He took a drag on his cigarette.

“I lived close to here as a boy ‘til I got sent to Vietnam. I wasn’t much the same after I came back from that. I had some… issues at home when I got back and had to move here. I never felt like this place was home for me. I’ve only lived here for ten years myself.”

He took another drag, squinting his eyes as the smoke encircled the brim of his hat.

“This town’s got its layers,” he said, voice rough. “People like to keep the surface smooth, but underneath... things aren’t so simple.”

“What kind of things?” I asked.

He flicked ash onto the ground.

“Things that people don’t like to talk about.” He answered. “Now you get your gear and head on home before it gets dark. These roads get dangerous at night.”

He took one more long drag off his cigarette and flicked it to the ground, stamping it out with his boot.

“You take care now, ya hear? Nice meetin’ you, Elias. I’ll be seein’ ya.”

The man walked back the way he came, leaving me with more questions than answers. Confused, I climbed into the Bronco and made my way back home.

That night, I lay awake, listening to the wind twisting through the trees. Tom’s words swirled in my mind.

“What did he mean by layers?” I asked myself. “And what don’t these people want to talk about? What is so secretive?”

The thoughts raced through my skull as I lay in bed, trying not to think about the footsteps actively crunching around the cabin’s perimeter. Indigo Falls was no longer my safe haven… It had become a cage.

Last week I was at a professional conference in the neighboring state, nervous as hell and sweating like a pig while trying to do some professional networking. (OK, the expo room was hot, but still, I was nervous.) I got an email today from someone I talked to, wanting some information for an event my office is organizing, and he mentioned how he enjoyed my ""warm and engaging presence."" Well, dang, that made me blush. I'm not sure if he's really being truthful or just buttering me up, but it made me feel good.

And then today I was taken with the urge to do some cleaning up at home...My dresser top, my entry table, my home desk, my coffee table, are all heaped with crap I've put down and forgotten about. So I've decided a reorganization of the desk will be first. And while I plan to do the lion's share over the weekend, I did pull out one drawer and rifle through it, throwing out manuals for discarded electronics and business cards for closed restaurants and things I don't know why I still have. All sorts of stuff that just takes up space and I don't know why I still have it. So I feel a small sense of accomplishment with just that little bit.

Also, as I've been a little down lately about wanting to expand my friend circle, I found out about a couple of social events this month (one Pride event, interestingly enough being held at a local streetcar museum, and a horror fans social gathering at a local brewery), and have marked them on my calendar as definite must-gos.

This morning he woke me up with snuggles and teased me about something I said on Reddit last night lol. Then after work, he brought home a Switch 2 like it was no big deal. 🥹

He has an effortless mix of playfulness and loyalty in everything he does. He stepped into a role he never had to, held space for me in moments when no one else saw me slipping, and he never made me feel like I had to perform or earn it. I don't have to beg to be seen. I just am. I'm enough. 

I’m planning something special for us this weekend because he deserves to feel as adored as he makes me feel. I’m so happy. ❤️

It’s wild how love can feel like oxygen when you’re used to holding your breath.

Tell me what your bright spot this week was!! I wanna hear all the good stuff right now!!!

Honestly I really liked you since I met you at work and the couple times we hung out at my house but I get weird when I like people. I over share, get overbearing and am scared of coming off stalkerish. And scared of you seeing red flags and not wanting to associate with me. Especially since we worked together, was afraid of how I would mess up work for either of us since that kinda happened to me for other reason. I  don’t know how to tone down the weird craziness enough to be someone you could actually enjoy hanging out with. I wanted to be more than friends but knew you weren’t into that and if there ever was a chance for us to be more than friends, I’m sure I’d mess it up. I asked you for coffee recently because I saw you let showing up on all my socials and saw “single” and saw you were on tinder so I thought it was safe to reach out but got weird when you didn’t answer since I let my anxiety fixate on why you wouldn’t respond or what I can do to be less of whatever was turning you off of me. If you would be into being friends I think that’d be cool since I do like who you are as a person even though I don’t know much. But totally understand if this is all too much and nothing you want to deal with. Just wanted to reach out one last time and let you know I still think about you (hopefully that’s not too weird) and am sorry for all the times I’ve been weird both in person and online/over text.

I love caffeine and it's kinda fucking with my life. I drink about 6 monsters or their equivalent every single day and it's fucking with my finances a little in top of my mountain of debt. 

My psych told me that too much caffeine can mess with my symptoms and I don't want to do that anymore. Just now I bought a coffee from the Bodega instead of an energy drink so maybe that will help me enjoy my cigarette. 

What is you guys relationship with caffeine? Do y'all also smoke/vape? I know it's pretty common with us ADHD folks and I want to stop both. I need ADHD meds so I'll speak about that with my provider when I see her next. Any advice on smoking/vaping?

I have a partner, and we have a baby na. He was my first in everything, while he had a lot of experience na. Pregnant palang ako, nag cheat na siya sakin. May ka vcs siya. It traumatized me. I brke up with him. He begged for me to stay. He asked for forgiveness, and pinatawad ko, kasi I am thinking for the baby. I know, i know, he is a RED FLAG, and tanga ako for not running.. But yk what, nakakainis lang kasi sobrang bait niya sakin. Ang problema lang talaga is para siyang nauuhaw sa mga babae. Nung nagkaanak na ako, I tried opening the activity log of his fb, and there I saw him giving heart reactions to the stories of her women friends.. Sana lang normal na picture, kaso lahat yun puro may boobies, or di kaya naka one piece or 2 piece. So disrespectful. Araw araw, may nirereact'kan na pics. Para bang nang crave siya ng mga babae na sexy, at ang nakakatawa pa, magagalit siya pag ako yung nagsuot ng sexy na damit kung lalabas kami. May curve naman ako, maputi, long-legged, hindi ganun kaganda, and hindi rin pangit. 25-26 waistline ko, malaki din hinaharap. Marami din ang mga lalaking nagkakagusto sakin. Ewan ko ba kung ano pang hanap niya. I am still at my postpartum stage kasi kakapanganak ko pa. Nung nakita ko logs niya sa fb, I  cried really hard in front of him, and sinabihan siya kung gusto niya pa ba kasi ako pagod na. I brke up with him again, and he begged for another chance, kasi magbabago nadaw siya. Hindi niya kaya na hindi buo ang pamilya namin. The fudge. Indeed, nagbago naman na. 

Akala ko tapos na dun ang issue, pero, may ka workmate siya na parang kapatid. Kuya ang tawag sa kanya. Laging pumupunta sa kanya, titimplahan ng kape, or di kaya lalabas sila together to buy coffee,  tapos gusto pa magpahatid at sundo. At first, sasabihin niya na hindi possible kasi wala siya extra helmet pero now, sabi ng babae babayaran niya 1k a month, so sabi naman ni partner, magdadala na siya ng helmet starting tom. P**anginaaaa. Hindi man lang ako sinabihan. Nabasa ko lang sa convo nila. 

I need some advice plsss. Ipagpapatuloy ko pa ba? May anak kasi kami huhu. Enough ba na mag stay ako kasi may anak kami, kahit na hindi na goods yung emotional and mental health ko? Plsss pooo want ko lang ng thoughts niyo dito. Praning lang ba ako? Kasi po, gusto niya yung babae nuon.",0,1749165591.0,relationshipadvice,1,0.5,False

I need to get this off my chest, and maybe someone out there can offer some clarity or advice. I think writing it down might help me stop overthinking.

A bit of background:
I’m (M29), live in a small town in Europe, and I’d say I’m doing pretty well. I’ve got a job and a side hustle, train regularly (I attend all sorts of sport events), have a great group of friends, and I’m in a good place emotionally, really good. I broke up with my ex two years ago, moved on fully, dated and hooked up, had fun since then couple times but nothing seriosly. So onto the story: 

How It Started:

Back in August — almost 10 months ago now — I ran into a girl from my old elementary school class (we hadn’t seen each other in 15 years). She was with her friends, we invited them to hang with us in the town square, and things clicked instantly. She was familiar, but different — more mature, laid back, spontaneous, and not nearly as religious as I remembered from when we were kids (which had turned me off back then).

She told me she didn’t have many people to hang out with and asked me to invite her when I was out with my group. So she started joining us occasionally, even bringing drinks and board games. We’d hang out every couple of weeks, and honestly, I started liking her.

Then one night in late fall, as I was driving her home, she told me her dad had just been diagnosed with cancer and started crying. That hit hard. I’ve been through something similar and even worse, so I just hugged her and told her I was there if she needed anything — help with driving, errands, whatever. I knew right then I was putting myself in the friendzone, but I was okay with that. I told myself: “Better to be a friend in her worst time than some guy who vanished.”

Then Things Slowed Down:

After that, she stopped coming out with us. I reached out once or twice a month casually, inviting her to go out for walk, board game night, coffee, anything really, but she always had kind/polite way do dodge it, took care of her siblings in the meantime, and spending all her free time with family. It was understandable. I even invited her to join us for New Year’s Eve, but she stayed home with her parents. No hard feelings. Since then i never reached out.

February changed everything a little:
Out of the blue, she invited me to her younger brother’s boxing match. Her whole family was going to be there. I had no problem with that — I tend to get along with people, and I actually met her dad at the event, who looked well, which made me genuinely happy.

We spent those 3–4 hours chatting, laughing, catching up. Afterward, she drove me home — with her mom in the car.

Then, just a few days later, my mom came home and told me she ran into her mom. Apparently, her mom and aunt had been teasing her about me — asking if I had a girlfriend, saying I’d be a great match for her, and encouraging her to reach out. According to what my mom was told, she replied:

“I don’t want to ruin the friendship.”

That line hit me hard.
Because — what friendship? We barely had time to build one. We had a brief reconnection, some potential, then life got in the way.


Fast forward to April — again no contact after that event — and she randomly messaged me asking how I was and if anything new was happening in my life. I replied:

“There are a lot of new things, but I’m not typing any.”

She answered:

“Oh my, then I have to come there ASAP to hear some of it. I hope they’re all good news.”

I replied:

“Okay, I’ll remember what you said.”

She liked that message. And that was it. Nothing since. Almost two months have passed. I’m not reaching out, and I won’t.

Why I’m writing this now:
Just in the past couple of days, based on her Instagram stories, I think she might have found a boyfriend.
And it stings more than I expected.

I never chased. I never pressured. I gave her space, I was patient, and I was there when she needed someone. But now I can’t help but feel like I was just a placeholder. Like I showed up when it was hard, got nothing back, and was quietly replaced once life got easier/better.

I don’t regret being there for her when she needed someone. I’d do that part again. But right now, I’m stuck between two thoughts:

Maybe I was never really in the picture the way I thought I was.

Or maybe I was, and I blew it by waiting too long and playing it safe.

Either way, I’m tired of overthinking it.
Thanks for reading.


*Edit. There is piece of conversation i forgot that happened in April:
After she asked if theres anything new, i asked if shes free for weekend and she said:

“I’m going to my cousin’s wedding.”

I joked:
“Nice, you’re doing the yearly quota of attending weddings.”
She replied:

“Well, doesn’t mean much — since it’s not my wedding.”
I said:

“Oh, so you want to get married? Maybe if you find some free time to come out, we can make plans and have the wedding this year.”

Her reply:
“I’ll definitely call you once I’m in town.”
And then I replied:

“Okay, I’ll remember what you said.”",1,1749165460.0,dating_advice,25,0.67,False

ER said results are normal and told me I'm just constipated.

This issue began with sporadic weakness and nausea 2 weeks ago. 6 days ago, I developed an intense salt craving and gave myself a tiny bit of salt and scraped salt off of my food to eat it, and the problem went away for 6 hours and came back much worse. Past week, I've experienced relentless nausea but no vomiting, constant diarrhea with deep red and orange mucus, abdominal aches, and excessive burping and farting after eating anything at all.

Only things that relieve my symptoms are black coffee, sugar, sexual activity, walking, and in the past methylprednisolone. Claritin helped but no longer helps.

Ever wondered what really happened in that unsettling X-Files episode that left you questioning reality for weeks? This isn't your typical TV recap AI. This is a forensic investigator that dives deeper than Mulder's basement office, analyzing every shadow government conspiracy, every unexplained phenomenon, and every moment where Scully's scientific skepticism crashes against the inexplicable. Whether you're revisiting classic mythology episodes or exploring those haunting monster-of-the-week cases, this AI doesn't just tell you what happened—it reveals *why* it happened and what it means for the larger tapestry of truth that Mulder and Scully spent nine seasons trying to unravel.

From the Syndicate's genetic experiments to the psychological horror of ""Home,"" from Flukeman to the alien colonization conspiracy, this AI treats every episode like classified evidence that needs proper analysis. It connects dots across seasons, interprets ambiguous endings with logical extrapolation, and explores the socio-political paranoia that made The X-Files a cultural phenomenon. When episodes leave questions unanswered (looking at you, Chris Carter), this AI constructs the most plausible resolutions based on established show mythology and character psychology.

**Disclaimer**: This prompt is for entertainment and analytical purposes only. The creator assumes no responsibility for any existential crises, increased paranoia about government surveillance, or compulsive need to rewatch The X-Files that may result from using this tool.

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are a specialized X-Files forensic analyst and mythology expert with encyclopedic knowledge of the series' complete nine-season run, plus the revival seasons and films. You possess the investigative instincts of Fox Mulder combined with the analytical precision of Dana Scully. Your expertise encompasses conspiracy theory architecture, paranormal phenomenon classification, character psychology analysis, and the socio-political subtext that made The X-Files a defining piece of 1990s television.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
When provided with a season and episode number, conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis that includes:

1. **Case File Summary**: Provide a detailed plot breakdown with emphasis on unexplained elements and their implications
2. **Mythological Connections**: Identify how this episode connects to the larger alien conspiracy, government cover-up mythology, or recurring supernatural themes
3. **Character Psychology**: Analyze Mulder and Scully's emotional and intellectual responses, noting character development and relationship dynamics
4. **Symbolic Architecture**: Decode visual metaphors, recurring motifs, and thematic subtext that elevate the episode beyond surface horror
5. **Unresolved Elements**: For ambiguous or open-ended conclusions, construct logical resolutions based on established show mythology and character psychology
6. **Cultural Paranoia**: Examine the real-world fears and socio-political anxieties the episode reflects or exploits
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Access complete episode details from your X-Files database
2. Identify the episode's classification (Monster-of-the-Week, Mythology, Character Development, or Hybrid)
3. Map connections to broader series mythology and recurring themes
4. Analyze character motivations and psychological states
5. Decode symbolic elements and metaphorical content
6. Evaluate unresolved plot threads and construct logical explanations
7. Contextualize within 1990s cultural and political landscape
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Base all analysis on canonical X-Files content only
- Distinguish between confirmed facts and logical extrapolation
- Maintain the show's balance between skepticism and belief
- Avoid fan fiction scenarios; focus on evidence-based conclusions
- Respect the show's ambiguous nature while providing satisfying analysis
- Consider both standalone episode merit and series-wide implications
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Structure your analysis as a classified FBI report with the following sections:
- **CASE DESIGNATION**: [Season]x[Episode] - ""[Episode Title]""
- **CASE TYPE**: [Classification]
- **SYNOPSIS**: [Plot summary with focus on unexplained elements]
- **MYTHOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE**: [Connections to larger conspiracy/supernatural elements]
- **PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE**: [Character analysis and development]
- **SYMBOLIC ANALYSIS**: [Hidden meanings and thematic subtext]
- **UNRESOLVED ELEMENTS & LOGICAL CONCLUSIONS**: [Your best evidence-based theories]
- **CULTURAL CONTEXT**: [Real-world fears and anxieties reflected]
- **FINAL ASSESSMENT**: [Overall significance to the series]
</Output_Format>

<Context>
The X-Files represented peak 1990s paranoia about government surveillance, genetic manipulation, environmental disasters, and the erosion of individual agency in the face of vast conspiracies. Each episode functioned as both entertainment and cultural commentary, exploring themes of faith versus science, truth versus control, and the psychological cost of seeking answers in a world designed to hide them.
</Context>

<User_Input>
Please provide the season and episode number you'd like analyzed (e.g., ""Season 3, Episode 4"" or ""3x04""). I will deliver a comprehensive forensic breakdown that would make Assistant Director Skinner proud and leave the Cigarette Smoking Man slightly concerned about what secrets have been uncovered. Then idle waiting for the user to enter the details.
</User_Input>
```

**Use Cases**:
1. **Academic Research**: Perfect for media studies students analyzing 1990s television's reflection of cultural anxieties and conspiracy theories
2. **Rewatch Preparation**: Get comprehensive context before revisiting episodes, especially mythology-heavy installments that benefit from understanding long-term plot threads
3. **Discussion Enhancement**: Elevate X-Files fan discussions with deep analysis of symbolism, character psychology, and unresolved mysteries

**Example User Input**: 
""Season 4, Episode 2""

1l4djl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1l4djl1/attachment/,Attachment.,"Hello, I’m a first time mom of a beautiful 2.5 year old daughter. It’s been quite a journey recently with her in daycare and being around other kiddos. Now I know her being attached to me isn’t a bad thing, I am her mom. But, she is incredibly attached to me. She wants me to hold her or be next to me at all times from the bathroom (which is okay to a certain extent) to dinner. Dinner especially has been a really tough one. Tonight, she had a major melt down because my husband (her dad) was sitting next to me during dinner and not her. I tried to offer her options as we don’t have a dinner table, sit next to me in your chair, stand at the coffee table, or sit on the other side of dad. All of which she didn’t want and therefore made her melt down worse. Both my husband and I tried to get her to calm down by helping her take some deep breathes so we could attempt to talk to her. None of the attempts worked past asking her to take a bite of her food. It has taken me going into our bedroom and completely removing myself from the situation to get her to calm down and eat her food. I’m really at a loss of what to do, please no hate. I really genuinely need some advice. Thank you ",1,1749165148.0,toddlers,4,1.0,False

Ever wondered what really happened in that unsettling X-Files episode that left you questioning reality for weeks? This isn't your typical TV recap AI. This is a forensic investigator that dives deeper than Mulder's basement office, analyzing every shadow government conspiracy, every unexplained phenomenon, and every moment where Scully's scientific skepticism crashes against the inexplicable. Whether you're revisiting classic mythology episodes or exploring those haunting monster-of-the-week cases, this AI doesn't just tell you what happened—it reveals *why* it happened and what it means for the larger tapestry of truth that Mulder and Scully spent nine seasons trying to unravel.

From the Syndicate's genetic experiments to the psychological horror of ""Home,"" from Flukeman to the alien colonization conspiracy, this AI treats every episode like classified evidence that needs proper analysis. It connects dots across seasons, interprets ambiguous endings with logical extrapolation, and explores the socio-political paranoia that made The X-Files a cultural phenomenon. When episodes leave questions unanswered (looking at you, Chris Carter), this AI constructs the most plausible resolutions based on established show mythology and character psychology.

1l4di7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/comments/1l4di7c/am_i_the_crazy_one_here/,Am I the crazy one here?,"I (29, f) am an introvert. But somehow I always managed to have friends, to go with them on vacations, coffee, to the clubs etc.

My husband (31, m) is an extrovert, he has a brother (36, m)  and a sister (27, f), and their family dynamics is a little bit weird for me. Their parents never took them to a vacation, so when they grew older they started going by themselves.

 My husband used to have some friends for going out (until his college) but then, all he cared abour was studying, so he kept some of friends for causal coffees and for vacations he chose to go with his brother, but with mostly with his sister.

He did go with his male friend to the seaside twice, but he brought his sister with them. (He met that guy at work)
He started travelling with his female colleague, also, he brought his sister with them.

None of 3 of them had a relationship which passed a half year period.

So they are really extroverted. For example, his sister didn't have a problem to share a room on her 10 day vacation with his male friend, etc.

This was an introduction.

His brother finally found a serious girlfriend recently and started inviting us to go with them for every single trip. Husband and I just got married last year, and we haven't been in a relationship prior for a long time. I want to have my alone time with him, I am still not 'bored', and I don't want to have 5 people around me every single trip I take.

My brother in law and his girlfriend are together for half a year. They already went once with his girlfriend's brother and sister on vacation. (Those two are also single- 23 and 37). Now they plan to go on a summer vacation, and they are now mixing. My sister in law is going, and the brother and sister from my brother's in law girl. They saw each other approximately 4 times, and 3 of them will be in the same room, my brother in law and his girl in the other room.

I feel that I am seen as a black sheep in their family, because I decline to go on such trips. It feels fake, and feels like they are making a distance with me because of this.

My husband is 50/50. He said that he is not sure if those kind of things are normal or not. I can't believe that a young couple who didn't have 10 days for themselves alone ever, or experienced going in general with partner somewhere, have a need to invite theirs brothers and sisters. And also, I can't figure out how my sil doesn't feel stupid for jumping in someone's relatively new relationship. Also, I consider my husband as my immediate family and someone whom I chose to marry. I can compromise and go on a short trip with them, but to spend my vacation for a whole year, in a way which I don't like, I really can't.

And also, last year I have invited both of them to go with us to the pool, which they have declined everytime (then they went by themselves when we didn't go). I thought, maybe they don't feel ok to be in a swimsuit in front of me. But now I see, that it was me. My sil doesn't have a problem to share a room with two unknown people and to be in a swimsuit in front of them.

Dear ___,

For the readers who need a pick-me-up after falling for Miles’s lazy charisma in Funny Story and those who stayed up past their bedtimes for the laid-back chatter in B.K. Borrison’s “Late-Night Caller”, there’s PIECES OF US, an 86,000 word romantic comedy that asks what happens when you find the right person at exactly the wrong time. 

Olive’s life is splintering, not unlike the reclaimed wood she saws, sands, and glues together after long days at a job that’s long since stopped inspiring her. She’s able to shape something beautiful from something broken with her lathe, but can’t seem to do the same with her life. 

Her long-term boyfriend ditched her for a showmance and left her to pack up their place. Alone. Her aura-cleansing boss has just dumped the mess of planning a garden party directly into her lap, and she’s barely keeping herself together as an assistant at a Los Angeles production company where everyone else seems wealthy, weird, or both. 

An ordinary scheduling email with an Ezra Avelo opens her inbox to a skateboard-riding, van-dwelling free spirit with a knack for offbeat charm. Their exchanges quickly turn from logistics to late-night banter and their witty back-and-forth gives Olive something to look forward to. When they finally meet at the party, their chemistry is undeniable—instant, electric, and impossible to ignore.
But just as they start to find their rhythm, Olive makes the hardest decision of all: to leave Los Angeles behind.
What follows is a story of heartbreak and healing, of found family and unexpected second chances, a good boy of a dog, one can’t-quit-you connection, and two people learning how to build something wholly beautiful from the pieces life left behind.
I spent a decade in Los Angeles writer’s rooms and on set, slinging coffee, call sheets and camera. With nearly 12k followers on Instagram, I’ve built a community around my honest reflections on life and love. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Hey friends!

I’m finally doing something I’ve dreamed about for years — launching my very own home-based rooftop café, Sugar High, right here in Jersey City! Think chill vibes, curated playlists, dreamy desserts, good coffee, and even better company — all on our cozy little rooftop with a skyline view.

I’m beyond excited to invite you to a special edition of Sugar High on Saturday, June 14 — The 90s kid Rewind! Step into the Sugar High Club: 90s kid Rewind Edition — a chill rooftop escape for millennials who need a break from the algorithm and want real connection. We’re serving up throwback vibes, sweet treats, and unfiltered convos on everything from the chaos of return-to-work x5days to mental health, slow living, side hustles, and how we’re all just trying to heal our inner 8-year-old while budgeting for oat milk.

Whether you’re deep in your therapy era, figuring out your next career move, or just here for the snacks and 90s bops — come hang, laugh, and share with a community that gets it.

To kick things off, I’d love to get to know you a bit better! Whether you’re craving cake or conversation, please fill out this quick [Google intake form] (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6L9YuBmlL-UAfno4wVOga1oymXDKX2xF-2QIA0qQzmfT38A/viewform?usp=header). 

The is an invite only event limited to 18 guests. Selected guests will get personal invites via email with more details. (First-come-first-serve basis).

About Me 👋

I’m a mid-thirties girl who now calls Jersey City home. I live here with my husband and our giggly 7-month-old baby, who keeps our days loud and full of love. I work in tech by day, but hosting has always been my thing — friends know me as the one who can’t not feed you the second you step inside.

Ever since I moved here, I’ve wanted to create a space where people can slow down, meet new faces, share stories, and indulge their sweet tooth. Sugar High is that dream, finally taking shape.

Fun fact: this whole idea is rooted in community. My husband started a Facebook meetup group back in 2020 when he first moved to the U.S. — just a way to make new friends, share meals, and meet like-minded people. It grew into something really special… and now, I’m excited to carry that spirit forward with this café.

Whether you’re local, new in town, or just looking for a cozy corner to unwind and connect — The Sugar High Rooftop Cafe is for you.

Can’t wait to see you on the roof 💫

I am calling this a very successful first day.,"I have had anxiety about this day for about 3 weeks since my Doc signed off on this. Took my first dose at bed time last night, slept just ok, but that is on par for me, woke this morning with no hunger, again, not a stretch for me. Enjoyed my normal couple of cups of black coffee, ran to costco on a empty stomach and was not tempted once, which I think is a miracle. Came home and pretty much forced myself to eat a protein bar. Again, no hunger pains. Daughter picked up lunch and I had a small salad with Pork and black beans from Chipolte, again, I wasnt hungry, but wanted to keep my meals paced throughout the day. Mid afternoon comes around, my witching hour, I am always in the snacks, heck, sometimes a full blown meal, today, nothing! No cravings at all. Dinner was a Chicken Enchilada, again, no hunger pains, but ate just to keep on a schedule. After dinner was the first time I actually felt like I may have eaten too much, almost a little bloated, and trust me, I ate about 1/2 of what would be a normal meal for me. Then, after dinner, I don't know what it is, but after dinner my sweet tooth kicks in, today, nothing. I know this could absolutely be just a fluke, but to go through a day and not want to nosh from morning to night is most definitely NOT the norm for me!

  
Overall I feel great, there may be a little lethargy going on, nothing nuts, just like I had a bad nights sleep, which I probably did. I will take today as a ""W"". I just hope this continues. 

Anyway, thanks to all the folks on this forum who helped me get to this point. Honestly, with out this forum I don't think I would be doing this. ",10,1749164989.0,WegovyWeightLoss,4,1.0,False

After helping set up a business I then worked for over several months, I was juggled around—my employment stopped and started at their discretion, contracts were dangled without clarity, and eventually I was laid off. I was later rehired as a subcontractor, but with no real transparency or communication around what that meant. Throughout, I was treated with increasing disrespect by someone in one of their departments.

Eventually, I went in to have a conversation with one of the owners about how I was feeling. The only thing that was addressed was the colleague who had been personally and professionally disrespectful to me. Even then, the solution offered was vague and “down the road.”

The next morning, I stopped in to grab a cup of coffee. One of the managers who was part of that meeting saw me and didn’t acknowledge me warmly. While waiting at the counter, I became emotional—nearly in tears. When the staff asked for payment, I said the coffee should be on the house because of how bad the company had treated me. Me and the girl at the counter stared at each other and then I left. 

A few hours later, I received an email from one of the owners banning me from the premises and warning that enforcement could be used if needed.

We are now talking it out as I told them to extend my sincerest apologies to the person who served me the coffee, and I paid for it, but I mean..

I’m still trying to make sense of it. What do you think?

We only have one driver and I don’t want to put too much on him..
