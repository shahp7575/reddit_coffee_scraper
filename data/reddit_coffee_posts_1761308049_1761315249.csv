1oeytoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1oeytoa/reviewing_every_parterre_gardens_perfume_ive_ever/,"Reviewing every Parterre Gardens perfume I've ever tried (most of them, it turns out!)","A few days ago I posted a [glowing review](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1ocj2eh/parterre_gardens_releases_cheverny_with_review/) of the just-released **Cheverny** \[Papyrus, golden amber, spices\] by Parterre Gardens, and got a couple of comments asking if I had any other recommendations from this house. I've tried a LOT of their scents, since I got into this house at their very beginning when they offered a freebie promotion, and after a while, probably since I was reviewing them so often, they occasionally would offer me press samples or prototypes to offer feedback on (that latter has been my *favorite* \- sometimes my feedback even impacted scents in progress!). So I thought I'd put up a big post reviewing every Parterre Gardens scent that I've tried = which, it turns out, is most of them!

Parterre Gardens is an actual garden - in addition to perfume-making, their main gig (as far as I can tell) is daffodils - and all of their perfumes are botanical. This gives their scents a really wonderfully fresh, herbal, occasionally almost medicinal quality - there's definitely a Parterre Gardens ""DNA,"" a base scent that underlies their work, just like (for example) Poesies often have that vanilla musk base. This freshness suits their floral scents SO well, and it also gives a really marvelous undertone to their deeper & darker scents too. And in addition to their specialty in natural florals, they do some of my all-time favorite cardamom scents too: **Chambord**, which I have in solid, perfume oil, and EDP format (it really is just that good) and **Vaux**, a favorite in summertime, and of course the new **Cheverny**, which I have as a solid but now that it's out I'm planning to get it in at least one other format as well.

Speaking of formats: they started off only doing solid perfumes, but now they do perfume oils, hair oils, and EDPs too (and apparently even some bath bombs, which I only *just* noticed while browsing the site as part of writing this review post). There are various sizes, including sample sizes, of each format. In general, I would say that their solid perfumes are fairly fleeting, lasting a couple of hours at most; their perfume oils are a little longer-lasting (just under half a day on my skin); and their EDPs are comparable to the typical perfume oil on me (on my skin, half a day or a bit longer). I'll make sure to indicate which format I tried something in, in the reviews below, and if I've tried something in multiple formats, I'll describe any differences I noticed in the scent.

One thing to note is that while they only list three things in their notes descriptions, those are more ""short lists,"" and if you go to the actual page for the scent (or get the emails announcing new releases), you'll find more detailed explanations, and much longer lists of the many botanical components that go into each one.

Also worth noting: the experience of Parterre Gardens' packaging and vials feels *extremely* luxe. Even their little plastic-potted solid sample sizes come in beautiful boxes or individual codex-style envelopes. Wax seals and other decorations feel expensive and special (but still thoroughly unisex). The sampler boxes in particular would make wonderful gifts. The perfume oil and EDP full-sizes come in really solid and completely lovely glass bottles (rectangular for the oils, round for the EDPs) and the solid FSes in heavy glass pots; it looks like the hair oils are in glass bottles too, though I haven't tried a FS of that format yet. I don't normally keep packaging, but I *have* kept Parterre Gardens' packaging.

By the way!! In addition to the new release of **Cheverny**, Parterre Gardens is currently running a sale on a LOT of their older scents (maybe they're trying to clear some inventory?) *and* are currently doing pre-orders on advent calendars, so it's a better-than-usual time to try them out. The advent calendars actually look like a really great way to try out a wide variety of their scents and formats - if you go to the individual listings, you can see what's included, if you don't want a surprise.

Some of these were given to me as press samples in exchange for an honest review.

\~\~\~

**Azay-le-Rideau** \[Black hemlock, maté, sage\] - A dark woodsy scent, herbal and resinous. The black hemlock reads a bit like pine - gentle pine, not an abrasive pine or a Christmas tree pine. Meanwhile I was a bit worried about the sage, since I don't enjoy the smell or taste of either dried or fresh sage leaves, but here it just gives me a sort of dusty herbal quality. This scent reminds me of a woodcutter's cottage. As a winter release, it's very much a January perfume for me, not a holiday perfume - this is a scent for leaning into cold, dark, dreary days with a cup of something hot warming your hands. A scent with dark strength, but like nearly all of the other Parterre Gardens perfume solids, low longevity. \[SOLID\]

**Cévennes** \[Spearmint, boronia, cedar\] - Fresh and a little bit fruity (that must be the boronia - here it's smelling of black cherry), with an herbal and almost medicinal spearmint note over billowing clouds of Parterre Gardens' wonderful cedar note. If you like the cedar in **Chambord** (see below) and want more of it, this would be a really lovely choice. Cedar-black cherry-spearmint (I'm getting them in that order of prominence) is an unusual concept for a perfume, and I'm not sure I'm loving this, but it is extremely interesting and I can definitely see this finding an audience. \[PERFUME OIL\]

**Chambord** \[Sandalwood, cardamom, cedarwood\] - **Chambord**, my beloved! Up until trying this one, I had *liked* quite a few Parterre Gardens scents, but this is the first one I fell *madly* in love with. For my little cardamom-loving heart, this is a gorgeous blend. While sharing several notes with **Poesie Comfort** \[Toasted cardamom pods, pink peppercorn, precious resins, sandalwood flower, cashmere blankets, warm vanilla musk\] (one of my all-time favorite perfumes), **Chambord** is much more unisex without that Poesie vanilla musk base underlaying it. Here in **Chambord**, the cardamom is bright and fragrant and spicy, accented beautifully by the somewhat herbal undertone of all Parterre Gardens' scents. I'm not sure if it's the cardamom or the cedar that is particularly citrusy; I wouldn't have been surprised if ""orange peel"" was among the notes. I have tried this in *three* formats! The solid and the perfume oil smell very much the same, but the oil has much greater longevity, and for some reason the cardamom in the solid version is especially fleeting (this is one reason why I think it's the cedar that's orangey, since that citrus effect sticks around longer than the spicy cardamom). Meanwhile, its EDP version is really something else, because it amps the cardamom even *higher* than the oil does (SWOON!). The first time I wore it, I walked into the room where my husband was sitting, and he immediately looked up from across the room and said ""you've just put on something with a lot of cardamom,"" so, success! The EDP definitely has more throw than the oil, and the cardamom note sticks around for longer than in the oil version too, so (I say with a bit of a gasp, because I have always, always preferred oils to EDPs)...is it possible I love the EDP version even more? \[SOLID AND PERFUME OIL AND EDP\]

**Cheverny** \[Papyrus, golden amber, spices\] - This is a seriously gorgeous scent. A thick, dusty paper note, a wave of spice (I get cardamom, nutmeg, and ginger, in that order), and a subtle vanilla sweetness, all over the recognizably fresh botanical base that seems to characterize the Parterre scents. This smells like libraries, like research in the archives, like a leisurely afternoon spent browsing a secondhand bookshop. It joins **Chambord** and **Vaux** (both of which share its cardamom note) as my top-favorite, holy grail Parterre perfumes. It's light academia to Chambord's dark academia. This is a TRIUMPH and \[I wrote at the time\] I can't wait for it to be released so you all can try it. If you like **Sorce English Major** or **Cardinal Gentle Reader**, I think you'd love this. It takes me straight back to my days this past summer sitting in the Cambridge University Library carefully turning the pages of 500-year-old music books. (Meanwhile, the first time I wore it, Husband sniffed my arm, and before I told him the listed notes, he said he was getting stonefruit incense, so...do with that as you will?) I've been wearing it constantly this fall, most often in my hair, which also helps the scent last longer - Parterre Gardens scents, being botanical, do fall on the shorter side for longevity, and I usually get a couple of hours out of them, but in my hair it can last the whole day. The other day I was wearing it in my hair and Husband, unprompted and not knowing what I was wearing, started praising the way I smelled. \[SOLID\]

**Ephrussi** \[Davana, palo santo, linden blossom\] - I came to this perfume several years ago not knowing what any of these three notes smells like, so all I could do when I wrote this review as the time was explain what this perfume smelled like to me, rather than evaluate how they execute these notes. This perfume is so bright and herbal that it's delightfully cheery, and it is unmistakably the sibling scent to **Chantilly \[version 1\]**. It smells of lemongrass but more orange, if that makes any sense, and on my skin (but not when simply sniffed in the vial) there's an undercurrent of woody incense. (And then I looked up palo santo, which is exactly that - woody, perhaps licorice-y incense - and I was feeling pretty proud of my nose.) \[SOLID\]

**Eyrignac** \[Guiacwood, cedarmoss, green mandarin\] - Earthy, woodsy, mossy, and green, with a snap of lemon brightness. Guiacwood can sometimes go smoky on me, but there's no smoke here, just a celebration of a walk through the woods on a warm and slightly humid day. I usually wildly prefer oils over EDPs - I can't stand the alcohol fumes that usually stick around for a while - but there was almost *no* alcohol fumage, and what little there was dissipated in like, a second. **Eyrignac** isn't a loud scent by any means, but I can smell this perfume on my arms without having to lift them up closer to my nose. The little EDP sample sprayer is cute and fully functional, no complaints about its spray, but I do wish it had a cap - you wouldn't want to toss this sample in a purse, for example, because there's nothing to stop it from accidentally spraying. \[EDP\]

**Èze** \[Patchouli, champaca, jasmine\] - Èze features a dark brown patchouli with notes of black pepper and loam. That patch is the primary note when sniffed cold, but then on my skin it's softened and warmed by a glowy golden champaca. I'm getting both champaca resin and champaca flower; the latter is probably my nose just noticing the jasmine note. I'm not identifying it as jasmine specifically, so no worries about jasmine indoles here. I don't have a ton of experience with champaca notes, but I recognized this immediately from **Pulp Fragrance Mark of the Moon** \[Golden champaka, sweet spices, Peruvian myrrh, white copal, patchouli, & tonka bean\], and in fact, the longer I wore **Èze**, the more it reminded me of that Pulp scent, so if you like **Mark of the Moon**, this would be a really great one to try. This is an extremely autumnal perfume, all golden-bronze in its scent color, so perfectly reminiscent of leaves changing and warm autumn sunsets. I like it more than I thought I would, given my general distaste for patchouli, but (you guessed it) Husband sniffed the patch on me and eagerly snaffled this one. I can also note that this is one of my longest-lasting Parterre Gardens scents. For most of their scents in solid format, I only get an hour or two from them, but this one just keeps going and going. \[SOLID\]

**Islette** \[Honeysuckle, coffee flower, vanilla\] - I have gotten to try Islette as both a solid perfume and as a perfume oil (originally it wasn't going to be released as an oil, but I and apparently enough other people asked, so he delivered!). This honeysuckle is a delicate flower, but there's a lot of it so she is STRONG! Not at all indolic or heady - this isn't a ""bold white floral"" - but gosh it's a whole *snootfull* of honeysuckle bush. The coffee flower is so interesting, it's a mesmerizingly elusive sort of creamy yet earthy and green-ish (?) floral that my nose can't quite pin down, but one that's constantly drawing me in in for another sniff. When this scent was released, its extensive description said that there's also several different vanillas as well as jasmine and pink grapefruit notes, but honestly I'm not sure I'm getting any of that, not even the vanilla. This scent really feels like ""HONEYSUCKLE...plus some other interesting and totally new-to-me flower."" I don't really get much difference difference in the scent between the solid and the oil versions of this - it still has that strong and slightly wilted honeysuckle note, and the earthy yet creamy coffee flower. I do find the oil easier to apply than the solid. I spent my summer frequently wearing the perfume oil as a hair oil and I LOVE it - the wafts of honeysuckle and earthy coffee flower around my face are so fresh and lovely, and it lasts longer in my hair too. \[SOLID AND PERFUME OIL\]

**Lourmarin** \[Rockrose, mimosa, yuzu\] - This one smells herbal, bitter, and citrusy (a yellow citrus, not an orange-colored citrus), in that order - extremely botanical and fresh, as if I have crushed plants underneath my fingertips then raised my fingers to my nose. I can make sense of the bitterness from yuzu rind, but I was puzzled as to which of these notes caused the intensely herbal note, so I looked up rockrose: turns out, rockrose (rock rose) is not a type of rose, as I'd been assuming, but instead a flowering shrub (which,  in fact, produces the resin from which we get labdanum) and smells earthy, herbal, and warm - exactly what I'm getting here. Meanwhile, the mimosa flower is supposed to smell floral and powdery, and perhaps green or almond-like, but I'm not getting any of that unless it's contributing to the overall ""botanical"" effect. \[SOLID\]

**Milandes** \[Iris, ginger, frangipani\] - I love frangipani, particularly NAVA's, but I usually have it sweetened and softened with vanilla or musk. This one isn't a demure floral - the ginger gives it quite a spicy kick! It's a really prominent and very realistic grated ginger scent, and I'd call this perfume ginger first, accented by florals. I have had some bad experiences with iris going unpleasantly much too musky on my skin, but this one is a gentle and non-powdery blue-ish purple scent that compliments the fiery red-orange scent color of the ginger beautifully. \[SOLID\]

**Rambouillet** \[Immortelle, amber, allspice\] - Hello allspice! Spicy, peppery goodness, perfect for fall, with a bit of an herbal undertone that proves this is a botanical perfume (as are all of Parterre Gardens' perfumes!). For a while, that allspice is pretty much all you get, and it's so dark and spicy that it almost (but not quite) reads like incense. After a little while, though - an hour or so - the allspice recedes enough for the herbal element to come forward a bit, and at this point I googled ""what does immortelle smell like?"" so I could find out what I was smelling. Immortelle is a plant, but its scent profile can vary from ""sweet and dry"" to fresh hay, golden tobacco, honey, maple syrup, or even smoky tea. Here, I think the honey and smoky tea descriptors are most accurate to the scent on my wrists, but it's not literal honey or tea, just suggestive of them. It's a delightfully autumnal scent. \[SOLID\]

**Rayol** \[Nutmeg, piñon pine, vetiver\] - On Husband, it's an extremely resinous pine with nuances of suede and dirt - he says it's extremely nice and that he plans on snaffling this one! Interestingly, it's different on me. It still went on as evergreen and leather, but soon notes of soft citrus (I actually think that's the nutmeg, which is pulling citrusy rather than baking spice) and a really delicate, floral lavender emerged too. It's not quite my thing, but very much Husband's, and I'm going to love him wearing this. \[SOLID\]

**Trianon** \[Orange blossom, daffodil, clementine\] - I don't feel like I can give a truly authoritative review of this one since I have only tried multiple prototype versions (in both solid and oil formats, and they did in fact smell a little different from each other! Now that I'm thinking back, I wonder if they were two different versions that he was testing out on me.) Chances are, its very final version (which I have not yet ordered) may have ended up just slightly different.

* If you want to see my thoughts on the prototype: There's something so gorgeously realistic, not at all artificial or sweet about these soft springtime florals. I sometimes experience daffodil notes as unpleasantly musky, but this one here is light and fresh, and sits between white floral and green floral. Meanwhile, I generally adore orange blossom notes - this one is delicate and pearly, and the orangey aspect is highlighted by the addition of clementine. There's absolutely no herbal bitterness as you can sometimes get with neroli - this is just light and clean, understated and utterly gorgeous. \[THIS WAS MY REVIEW OF THE PERFUME OIL PROTOTYPE\]

**Vaux** \[Coconut, cardamom, vanilla\] - Absolutely *gorgeous*! The email introducing the new release gave some additional description: ""a sweet gourmand type perfume made of thirteen botanical compounds with key notes of floral vanilla orchids, candy-like cardamom, and light coconut to blend it all together"". The light, sweet coconut flesh is beautifully balanced with the white, airy vanilla, and the cardamom is indeed more sweet and gourmand than sharply spiced. I also make out a bit of lemon, perhaps an unlisted lemongrass. Like all the Parterre Gardens scents, being botanicals, it has low longevity and a bit of an underlying herbal, medicinal character that complements the sweet main notes so beautifully. I have this one in both solid and oil formats; oil version seems to have a stronger coconut and less cardamom than the solid version, and also lasts longer. I love this one especially in summertime. \[SOLID AND PERFUME OIL\]

**Villandry \[version 2\]** \[Osmanthus, tomato leaf, bergamot\] - Woah, somehow this reads like a smoky, leathery Lagavulin whisky! I'm not very familiar with tomato leaf, but Husband (who gardens) is, and he says he's really not getting it, though he does get a touch of citrus from the bergamot. Mostly, we both agree this is a lovely smoky peated whisky. Husband gleefully snaffled this one. \[SOLID\]

* The original **Villandry \[version 1\]** had these very different notes: Bergamot, neroli, may chang.

# Ones I haven't tried (currently available)

In this interest of completeness, since this post is specifically intended to help folks who haven't tried Parterre Gardens figure out which ones they might like to sample, here are the scents currently up on the site which I haven't tried. (One thing I noticed, while working on this review post, is that they don't have a master scent list! That would be really helpful.)

**Amboise** \[Cedarwood, juniper berry, sweet orange\]

**Auvers** \[Flouve, iris, mānuka\]

**Lucé** \[Bois de Siam, blood orange, bay rum\]

**Luxembourg** \[Jasmine, neroli, vanilla\] - Ooh, this one definitely needs to go on my wishlist! I'm not sure how I missed this one. It sounds so pretty!

# Not currently available on the site

Perhaps they will come back at some point? I don't have a firm understanding of how (or whether) Parterre Gardens does seasonal releases and cycles through different scents throughout the year.

**Chantilly \[version 1\]** \[Chamomile, ylang ylang\] - This is so bright, happy, and sunny! The chamomile is more floral than herbal, smelling of fresh rather than dried chamomile flowers. There are grassy and lemony notes, to the point where I wouldn't have been surprised to find lemongrass or lemon verbena among the notes description. I'm not sure I get any ylang ylang. This perfume is a bouquet of chamomile flowers, clipped this very morning from your own garden and arranged in a vase with some lemongrass or lemon verbena greenery for an extra punch of morning vibrancy. I'm puzzled why this one (in solid format), which one would think is composed entirely of top notes, has so much more longevity than my **Chambord** solid. \[SOLID\]

* I have also tried a prototype of **Chantilly \[version 2\]** which isn't a reformulation; it's a totally new concept with a completely different notes list. The new **Chantilly** isn't out yet, and I think it will end up different than the prototype I tried. Even though the original one isn't for sale on the site and probably will never be again, I wanted to include it in this post, because (at least for now) if you see **Chantilly** in the swaps, it'll be that original version.

**Fontainbleau** \[Sandalwood, Rose, Frankincense\] - Primarily frankincense, a particularly resinous, piney one. What little rose there is smooths out the resinous quality with its velvety petals. It's a treat, to have the rose willing to lie in the background  - in so many perfumes containing rose, the rose takes over on my skin. I like this one a lot! If you look for it, you can find that slightly herbal undercurrent. This was their first, early scent that incorporated a darker note in addition to the florals, and I thought it was wildly successful. I wrote in my review at the time that I hoped they'd do much more work with resins and incense as they develop new scents, and so they have - to great effect! I still love this resinous, piney frankincense note, and I hope they'll do more with it in future. \[SOLID\]

**Tuileries** \[Cinnamon, geranium, palmarosa\] - Spicy green floral and a thoroughly unsweet cinnamon, not cinnamon with the sweetness of sugar and other baking spices, but a cinnamon stick brewed into a cup of tea with no sweetener added. \[HAIR OIL\]

Finally, these are past releases from very early in Parterre Gardens' life, not currently available and which I haven't tried, but I'll include them because they may pop up occasionally in the swaps

* **Chenonceau** \[Rose, vanilla\] - I'm bummed to have missed this one now that I'm more personally interested in rose notes!
* **Giverny** \[Tea tree, lemongrass, vetiver\]
* **Versailles** \[Sweet orange, ylang ylang\]

\~\~\~

I really hope this post helps! I like this house a lot, especially their *cardamommmm*! (I have adored *every* cardamom scent they have released), their fresh botanical approach, and their wide range of formats and sizes available. They're not as well-known (I think they really should be!) and I'll admit their website is not the most user-friendly, particularly with its lack of a master scent list. So hopefully this big review post is useful!

I'd love to hear if you've tried Parterre Gardens and what you think, or if this has helped you pick out a first order. (I hope you'll include **Cheverny** or **Chambord**, if you do - they're SO GOOD!!)",1,1761315136.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

[$1000],"Hey all — short version: I’m not overly worried about price. What I care about is something that’s well built, enjoyable to use, will last years, and a + if it takes up little space.

A bit of background: I make coffee only for myself. I’ve had an Express Impress before and felt it was too big on my countertop, so a smaller setup really appeals to me. I enjoy both straight espresso and milk drinks like flat whites and cortados. I’ll be pairing whatever I get with a good hand grinder (1Zpresso J-Ultra or others — open for recommendation), and a NanoFoamer if I go for the 9Barista.

Right now I’m torn between a few different paths:  
• 9Barista MK2 Pro — portable, very compact, interesting workflow, and seems to offer serious espresso if you get it right. But is the shot quality, build, and reliability truly worth the asking price, especially over time?  
• A small traditional machine like the Breville/Sage Bambino or Gaggia Classic — maybe more practical everyday, easier workflow, built-in convenience, but larger footprint.  
• Something like the Cafelat Robot — simpler design and no electronics, potentially very durable, but more manual effort and a different type of experience.

I’d love to hear about your experiences with any of these machines, and what you’d actually recommend for someone in my situation. Which one would you choose if you were starting fresh, and why?

Done the resets, done the cleaning, changed beans….it always ends up at a grind setting of 1, 17.5 / 45. It tastes ok, luke warm and “watery.” 

Classic Coffee is always 25. 

Im a bit tired of troubleshooting this machine. Thoughts?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Västerås SK vs. Örgryte IS: A Tactical Timeout or a Total Breakdown?**

Let’s parse the chaos. The odds for this Superettan clash are as tangled as a pair of freshly washed headphones. **Västerås SK** is the slight favorite, with decimal odds hovering around **2.2 to 2.35** (implying a **43–45% implied probability** of victory). **Örgryte IS** checks in at **2.65–2.8** (a **36–38% chance**), while the draw sits at **3.6–3.7** (a **27–28% likelihood**). The totals market is all over the place: BetRivers offers **Over 2.5 goals at 1.51** (66% implied) and **Under 2.5 at 2.33** (42%), while BetOnline.ag flips the script with **Over 3.0 at 1.89** (53%). In short, bookmakers are as confused as a squirrel in a nut factory.

Now, let’s digest the news. Västerås, currently second in Superettan, is the football equivalent of a TikTok trend—innovative, polarizing, and slightly cringey. Their head coach, Kalle Karlsson, has weaponized the “tactical timeout,” a strategy so provocative it’s been compared to a chess player suddenly pulling out a Rubik’s Cube mid-game. Jonas Eriksson of SVT called it “uplifting,” but let’s be real: it’s less *Strategic Genius* and more *‘Hey, the clock’s stopped—can we go get a coffee?’* Västerås aims for Allsvenskan promotion by 2026, but Expressen’s recent analysis suggests their current second-place standing might be a mirage. The article hints that one of Kalmar, Västerås, or Örgryte is a “biggest bluff”—a team that looks good on paper but smells like burnt popcorn in practice.

Örgryte, meanwhile, is the sports equivalent of a reality TV contestant: everyone’s got an opinion about them. They’re in a promotion battle, but their underlying stats, per

So I’ve been on a roll with the McDonald’s Monopoly game lately, by scoring a  few free small coffees, feeling like I’m basically winning life. Decided to cash one in and had my husband redeem one too, because two smalls = one large, right? Basic math. ☕️

Using caution my hubby asks for a drink carrier, we get home, take the lids off… and surprise! Both cups are HALF FULL. Like someone in the back said, “Yeah, just split one large between ‘em,  they’ll never notice.”

So now I’m wondering, did we unlock the new McEconomy Size Coffee? Is this some kind of punishment for daring to redeem free drinks? Or just our local McDonald's SM being cheap? 

Either way, props to McDonald’s, they somehow managed to turn “free coffee” into “half a coffee and a full dose of disappointment.” 😂👏

1oeyevl,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoroccoLGBT/comments/1oeyevl/ghosting/,Ghosting?!,"Hey everyone, story time. I really need to get this off my chest and hear your thoughts.

So, for context I’m (29M) born and raised in Morocco. I studied abroad, worked there for a few years, and that’s also when I realized I’m into guys (that’s a whole other story lol).

Last year I decided to move back to Morocco, so I'm not super familiar with how the LGBTQ+ community works here. I know it’s not the best, but it exists… kind of.

So, like everyone else, I downloaded a few dating apps. Total disaster. The biggest issue I had? Ghosting, especially from moroccan guys, almost everyone I’ve actually met, whether for dates or casual stuff, were foreigners or tourists.

Anyway, fast forward to the main story. I matched with this guy on Tinder like 3Km away. He was discreet which I totally get ( like aren't we all discreet in this country).

So we vibed, and we started talking every day, moved to phone calls at most the nights, shared our days, and we had a lot in commons, it was honestly nice having him in my life. I didn’t even know what he looked like, and I didn’t mind. I respected his privacy and told myself I knew his soul, and that was enough (yeah, I know, the cheesiest thing you’ll hear today hhh).

Weeks went by, we had good days, bad days, just like a normal relationship. Then one day I asked if we could finally meet in a public place. I felt like I’d earned his trust by now; we couldn’t just stay online forever.

He said yes but suggested meeting at my place because he’s introverted and doesn’t like going out. Fair enough. So we planned a weekend together, nothing crazy, just some chill activities. I was genuinely excited. The whole week I couldn’t think about anything else (and no, not in a sexual way hhhh).

Friday comes around. We talk in the morning, and again during my lunch break. Then… nothing. Total silence.I texted him when I got home, no reply. 

I wasn’t sure if he’d blocked me, but I was in denial. I kept telling myself maybe something happened, maybe he lost his phone, maybe anything but ghosting. I stayed up until 3 a.m. before finally accepting it. He just disappeared.

The next day, I couldn’t stay home, so I went out for coffee with a friend and posted a story. And guess who viewed it? Yeap, HIM.

I got so pissed. That level of disrespect hurt. I sent him a message on Instagram, which is ghosted of course. So I unfollowed him, deleted his number… all that dramatic healing stuff. But truth is, I still think about him sometimes. 

Like, there’s this weird part of me that imagines us crossing paths one day, maybe bumping into each other, saying ""sorry"" and not realizing who the other is. 

Anyway, that’s my story with that ghost 👻 and I still wonder that, is there a reason for this like being scared or ashamed even though that's not an excuse, or it's just people are evil and sick !?

There's a coffee shop I've been going to 3-4 times a week for the past year. It's on my way to work, the coffee's good, I have my usual order, you know the drill. There's this one barista who's always really friendly - we do the usual small talk, weather chat, ""how's your week going"" type stuff. Nothing deep but like... pleasant regular customer vibes.

Last Friday I went in and she asked what my weekend plans were. I completely blanked and said ""yeah, good thanks"" which doesn't even make sense as a response. Then there was this awkward pause where I think she was waiting for me to correct myself, and I just... didn't. I paid, grabbed my coffee, and left. My brain only caught up to how weird I was once I was already outside.

I KNOW this sounds ridiculous. It's not like I insulted her or anything. But I've been avoiding the place all week and getting worse coffee elsewhere because I'm worried it'll be weird.

1oey188,https://i.redd.it/i8a0y2fec2xf1.jpeg,NBD thanks to your comments and concerns,"Twelve days ago, I posted a picture of a rough-looking 2019 Stumpjumper. A day later, I went to see it in person. The seller admitted he’d crashed it, messed up the brakes, dented the frame, and tried fixing the bike himself — with questionable results. Eventually, he gave up, deciding mountain biking just wasn’t for him.

The bike looked awful: dirty, neglected, and sad. But I could see it had good bones. After some friendly haggling, I walked away with it for $200, papers and receipts included. Honestly, it felt like a steal at that price.

Once home, I stripped it down completely. Cleaned everything, checked and regreased all the bearings and links, and rebuilt it with spare parts I had lying around — derailleur, chain, and flat pedals. I finally faced my fear and learned how to service the suspension and rear shock too. Turns out, it’s not rocket science — just a mix of patience, coffee, and mild anxiety.

I replaced the brake levers and pads, bled the system, threw on a new front tire, and patched the dents with filler before sanding and repainting the frame. Added my own individual touch, of course.

Today was the first proper ride — dialed in the suspension, bedded the brakes, and couldn’t stop grinning. The bike rides beautifully and feels completely mine.

Total cost: $450.
Total satisfaction: 100%.

Looking back, I wish I’d taken photos or videos of the rebuild, but maybe that’s fine — some projects are better remembered by the grease under your fingernails and the grin after the first ride.",19,1761313191.0,mountainbiking,2,1.0,False

While I've been generally pleased with the quality of the coffee (importantly both pour over and espresso) something happened yesterday that I've been waiting to happen. While my partner was brewing coffee she looked me in the eyes and said, ""I hate this grinder."" 

We need to find something that's a bit more of a joy to use with a bit less faff involved while using it. Her specific annoyances are, probably obviously, stalling. The other big issue is capacity.

I knew I was making compromises when I purchased this grinder, I'd save some money and it'd be a bit finicky. Well, the time has come to put up or shut up. Where do we go from here? Everytime I think about upgrading any piece of gear I realize how many new things there are that I don't know about. Should we just get the Lagom P64 I was initially listing over?? 

For background here's our grinder upgrade path: Baratza Encore > [bought a lever machine] > Kinu M47 > [tired of hand grinding larger batches] > Niche Zero > [wanted a little more out of our cups, specifically flat burrs] > DF64V. 

Out of all of them, the DF64V is her least favorite, though she did struggle with hand grinding.

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction! 

Here’s an icebreaker to help start a conversation / show me if you actually read through the post lol: what is something you are looking forward to / excited about?",2,1761313125.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,2,1.0,False

Increasingly as folks returned from summer holidays, we noticed that the office became very dirty. Garbage and coffee rings were left on desks day out. Illness also began to spread throughout the office in the beginning of October. Hundreds of people were out sick, no exaggeration, and productivity suffered.

Several of us went to the Facilities team to speak about the dirty office conditions. Facilities told us that the contract with the office cleaners states that they are not allowed to move any items from the desks, whether that be cups, papers, laptops, etc. Reminder that the entire office is hotdesking - there are no dedicated desks for anyone. They claim that the cleaners are allowed to wipe down desks around items that have been left, but it’s very evident that has not been happening.

I have at least one immunocompromised employee that I am aware of, and I am deeply concerned about her well-being. More broadly I cannot afford any further productivity hits, and morale is suffering due to the filthy office conditions. I don’t want to come in to the office because it’s often times absolutely disgusting conditions with garbage and grime.

I find it very strange that in a hotdesking environment, there would be a contract with the cleaners to not move any items. Again nobody has a dedicated desk, so anything left behind would be garbage or lost and found. I also find it strange that the contract doesn’t allow for wiping down of keyboards, monitors, mouses, that are left on the desk for employees to use. At a minimum though, it’s clear the desks are not being wiped down per the contractual requirements.

Seeking advice from HR professionals about this. This is a huge health & safety issue, and the attitude of the Facilities team that this is “working as intended” is very concerning to me.

People in Japan said that with this movie, MAPPA has redeemed itself and the movie felt like an apology for ""badly adapted"" season 1. They along with many people often complained how the S1 failed to incorporate and adapt the feeling of manga and this made me wonder how much did this people actually understood about the manga and how it feels.

It is a well known fact that Tatsuki Fujimoto is a cinephile. And if there are people who are still oblivious to this, then he also wrote a onwshot called Goodnight, Eri which you can read to confirm it.

But his love for cinema is not limited to just watching movies. He often incorporate the cinematic elements in his works. Be it panelling, pacing, portrayal of sense of humor in a mundane and grounded way rather than in over-exagerrated, over the top & comical goofy facial expressions and direct movie references. His works often have chaos in them and crafts it wlveey well with human emotions, personal quirks of characters and humor in such a way that they look realistic and grounded.

Amusingly, Season 1 followed the same formula with even added scenes like the one where Aki makes coffee and followdls his daily morning routine and minimalist music compared to literal orchestral vomit that we get in the name of hype music, the way the character talks and their pitch of voice changes and mimics actual outburts in anger, panic and anxiety (which was cut out of recent of recent showing in Japan and characters were more energetic and louder than in the original series).

The only thing that S1 didn't have as many people claimed was quirky nature of the manga which they either failed to notice or deemed it as too cinematic and realistic for their taste, a criticism which more like trolling than actual critique given Fujimoto himself keeps things grounded.

For many people, Chainsaw Man felt like a manga which needed an over the top adaptation like something from Studio Trigger or something like the movie which felt more in line with what a lot of original anime movies feel these days. When in reality, the manga itself doesn't feel like that. The closest thing that actually goves the same feeling as CSM manga are Coen Brother movies and S1 exactly felt like that. But strangely, it was termed a ""bad adaptation"".",1,1761312964.0,animeindian,1,0.67,False

The whole process takes like 2 hours and I somehow feel even more backed up after. I always have to guess if that uncomfortable feeling is just residual gas or actual incomplete evacuation. Even when I actually manage to clear myself out, the gas never fucking stops coming. Every night I'm kept up until 2am by the constant need to fart. And no treatment has ever worked, I've tried everything. It doesn't matter what I eat, or how often or how much, or the amount of fiber I take. I had a defecography and anorectal manometry. Was diagnosed with pelvic floor dyssynergia but I failed pelvic therapy. Only things that ever had an effect were prulacopride, coffee and olive oil, but after a period of somewhat smoother shits they all wore off and I'm back to square 1. Doctors can't or won't figure it out and I'm burnt the fuck out. How do I keep living like this?? What the fuck is wrong with me???

I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message with a quick introduction!

1oexot8,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1oexot8/the_way_they_hold_each_other/,“The Way They Hold Each Other”,"Clara’s life had changed in a heartbeat.

The accident had taken her arms, and with them, the simple rhythm of everyday things — brushing her hair, buttoning a shirt, reaching out to hug someone. She tried to move on, but every action felt like a reminder of what she had lost.

Most days, she stayed home. The world outside felt too sharp, too quick for her slower pace. But one afternoon, determined to feel normal again, she went to a quiet café downtown.

That’s where she saw Luna.

Luna sat by the window, tapping her phone with her toes, a book open beside her and a cup of tea steaming in front of her. She had no arms — she was born that way — yet there was something effortlessly graceful about her movements. People stared, but Luna didn’t seem to notice.

When the waiter brought Clara her drink, she accidentally knocked it, spilling coffee over the table. Before Clara could even react, Luna smiled and said softly,  
“Don’t worry, happens to me all the time.”

They started talking. At first about the mess, then about the weather, then about life. Luna’s humor was disarming, her confidence contagious. Clara found herself laughing for the first time in weeks.

After that day, they kept meeting — first by coincidence, then by choice. Luna showed Clara how she used her feet to paint, cook, and text faster than most people with hands. Clara showed Luna how she was learning to adapt after the accident — using her chin, her shoulders, her determination.

Their friendship slowly deepened into something warmer. They learned to help each other — one steadying the other’s drink, one using her shoulder to fix the other’s hair. Their affection wasn’t built on what they lacked, but on how they understood each other completely.

When Clara confessed that she sometimes still dreamed of having arms, Luna said,  
“You don’t need arms to hold someone. Trust me — you’ve been holding me since the day we met.”

And it was true.  
They learned to hold each other in ways the world didn’t teach — with words, with laughter, with quiet presence.

Ozempic & Wegovy never did anything for me. Once when I first reached 10mg on Zepbound did I feel what I believe was the correct experience and I lost 10 lbs. I could barely finish a small lunch or dinner. So on the plus side, I got to experience what I **should** be feeling.  Then insurance stopped covering it. 

I switch to Wegovy and it did nothing for me. After a year, I was able to switch back to Zepbound due to sleep apnea. However, I never again experienced the same feeling of being full etc. I recently decided to go for broke and go up to 15mg and the side effects of hiccups, burp, upper GI muscle spasms nearly finished me off.  I know some people say to push through the side effects, but when you are gasping and struggling to breath, it is not fun.

My body is highly resistant to drugs. Things that knock my wife out for days barely register with me. I have been overweight since I was 9, nearly 50 years (currently 250 lbs). I don't drink anything but water and coffee, eat healthy, no fast foods, no drugs, no smoking, my wife prepares all my meals.. probably around 2000 cals a day. We walk 2 miles every day.

I explained to them that I come from Iran and how I crossed border, they understandably were suspicious that I may be a spy but luckily I had a distent relative who immigrated there many year ago, he was a dentist and he lived in Boryspil (near Kyiv), so after some time they gave me a temporarily stay status, I stayed in Kiev for 16 months.

I loved my stay there, despite occasional air raids, it's a gorgeous city with remarkably resilient people.

Then on the suggestion of my relative I applied for asylum in Poland and I think because of biology degree I got through!

I crossed Hrebenne border on May 10 2024. In Lublin, i applies for asylum, citing displacement and fear of return to Iran.

Polish authorities issued me a temporary residence permit (pink slip), allowing me to stay legally while my claim was processed.

On July 20, At St. Anna’s Church, i got baptized as a Catholic, it was personal choice really.

I changed my name (not legally yet) to Reymond.

With my Polish temporary permit, i traveled legally within the Schengen Area, though i kept a low profile to avoid scrutiny. 

On August 1, i taked a FlixBus from Lublin to Warsaw, then hitched a ride through Berlin and Cologne to Paris!

I can't believe I was in freaking Paris!
But my final destination wasn't there.

On September 4, i joined a group of asylum seekers in Calais, I paid €2,000 for a spot on an overcrowded rubber dinghy crossing the English Channel. 

After a very scary 6 hour journey, i landed in Folkestone, UK!

Then I got processed by the UK Home Office at Dover. 

They grant me temporary protection status as an asylum seeker.

I used the Refugee Council scheme right after Dover processing.

By October 15, I got matched to a vetted shared flat in nearby Kilbur, It's was a basic double room in a 4 person house, damp walls, bunk beds, but it was clean.

Then I legally adopted the name Reymond post-asylum approval!

On November 6, i seat PLAB 1 exam at a London test center.

I studied night and day  in Kilburn’s library, fueled by a lot coffee and my experience in Kyiv clinic.

mid December I passed the first go!

Largely thanks to my biology background. 

With that in hand, i submited my UCAS application for UCL's MBBS by the extended deadline for refugees (around December 4), including my PLAB scores, personal statement on my journey, and references from the Kyiv clinic I worked at.

In January 2025 UCL calls me for an MMI interview on January 15, i nail it!

By late February, the acceptance letter arrived: conditional offer for the 2025 intake, with a refugee scholarship covering fees!

Finally I got into UCL halls on August 24, orientation hits the 25th, and classes begin Tuesday, August 26. 

First lecture was anatomy in the Cruciform Building. 

My journey from Tehran's despair to cold Moscow then in beautiful kive and lupin and gourgus Paris to London's lecture halls, was complete!

I just wanted to share to anyone that feels there world is at its end, it's always gonna get better!

I was very lucky I could have died in a smuggy day In Tehran or got drafted in Moscow or get killed in Kursk or get caught in Paris.

But I endured and although I don't know what future holds, I'm happy today.

1oexmmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepypastastories/comments/1oexmmz/im_an_intern_at_a_hospital_and_my_mistake_was/,I'm an intern at a hospital and my mistake was sleeping during a shift.,"The timer showed 23:29, it was another long night as an intern. I drank cold coffee, my back hurt, my eyes burned with sleep. The hospital was quiet, so I thought I could get some sleep.

I looked for empty rooms or any place I could get comfortable. Finally, I found a couch in a random room. I didn't think much, I lay down and slept.

2:09 am.

I woke up, but not by nature. I was still tired, but something woke me up. The hospital had a different atmosphere, it was colder, darker, the atmosphere was heavy.

I left the room and everything was weirder. I looked one way: no one. I looked the other way, towards the exit: still no one.

As I walked down the hallway, I looked inside the rooms. I wasn't surprised when I saw they were empty, but I really wanted to find someone in that place. I continued walking and the environment became increasingly heavier, as if evil was coming towards me... Or I was heading towards it.

I walked, passed through more rooms, until I saw a woman inside a room with the number 09.

It was a middle-aged woman, she was sitting in a chair with her damp hair covering part of her face. She had no expression, it was as if she showed no emotion, her face was paralyzed, but she looked at me as if she already knew I was coming.

""Lady, do you know where the others are?""

No response. I asked again.

""The others, do you know about them?""

She looked at me, but didn't answer me, she seemed to hear me. I didn't understand why he didn't respond. Her sagging, wrinkled skin made for a stranger scenario.

I gave up. And I left, but before she smiled softly. ""You won't find the others if you don't listen to me."" I froze, I was sweating cold, I felt fear run down my spine. I turned around and she continued:

""Listen carefully.
Step 1 - Just walk forward.
Step 2 - Do not enter rooms.
Step 3 - Do not change direction.
Step 4 - Don't look to the side.
And most importantly: Number 5 - Don't talk to anyone. Don’t trust anyone.”

I was confused because I knew I broke the rules by meeting her. “They’re not worth it to you?” She didn't answer me. So I left, continued walking without looking at the rooms, or changing direction. The silence inside the rooms was deafening, I felt like the rooms were full.

Until I arrived at the end of the corridor and I saw about 10 people sitting in the waiting room, staring at me with the same expression: all with deep-set eyes, dark circles under their eyes and, most strikingly, they were expressionless, as if they were robots.

“What’s going on here?” I started walking towards them, no one moved. I asked them, went from one side to the other, but no one moved.

Then I saw the exit. I didn't think twice and ran towards her. I pushed the door open, and as soon as I saw the street, the gentle early morning wind gave me a minute of relief, but it didn't last long. Only at that moment did I realize that I had broken 4 of the 5 rules.

The same lady I had seen in room 09 was outside, standing on the sidewalk. Wearing apparently dirty and damp patient clothes, she slowly came walking towards me with her eyes staring into mine. She said, ""Why didn't you listen to me? Don't you trust me?""

I said I trusted her, but at the time I didn't remember the rules. I spoke to the patients, changed direction, entered the waiting room and looked around. She looked at me coldly with a dark and deep look, I felt that that look went to my soul. She turned and walked towards the hospital whispering: “Olivia, don’t trust anyone.”

Like a snap, his words entered my head and I realized that I had broken the most important rule among the others, rule number 5. 

I took a deep breath as I tried to calm down. To do this, I put my hands in my pockets.

There was a note.

""Be careful, don't talk or trust the lady in room 09.""",1,1761312158.0,Creepypastastories,0,1.0,False

Just like how you remember your friend likes coffee black, AI agents need memory to truly help us. Without it, they're just fancy calculators responding to the present moment.

Memory lets AI agents:

– Remember your preferences (so you don't repeat yourself constantly)

– Learn from past interactions (getting smarter over time)

– Make predictions based on patterns (spotting market trends before they happen)

At Ozak AI, we're building prediction agents that leverage both short-term memory (for immediate context) and long-term memory (for deeper pattern recognition). Our agents analyze real-time market data while recalling historical patterns, helping traders avoid emotional decisions and maximize returns.

You’ll have a trading partner who remembers every market crash, rally, and trend from the past decade, using that knowledge to guide your next move.",2,1761312157.0,Ozak,0,1.0,False

Hello, I (24f) have been with my boyfriend (24m) for 2,5 years, and everything is going great between us. He has this great aunt who is like a grandma to him, but he’s always said she has a weird attitude. 
Aunt (81f) has invited us over for dinner with her and her husband many times, and every single one of them she made 3 store bought frozen pizza for the 4 of us. Sometimes also fruit salad. 
This wasn’t a problem, I love pizza and my bf always said she’s “too tired to cook”, which I understand. But I started noticing a pattern: when she invites me and bf, she’ll make this pizza, but when it’s just him she’ll make pasta, second course (always a whole sea bass or another type of fish), salad, fruit and a sweet. 
At first I thought this was a coincidence, but it happens literally every single time she invites us over. 
One evening she had only 2 pizzas and gave more than half to my bf and like 3 slices to me, dividing part of the other pizza between her and her husband. I was a bit confused but didn’t say anything, and my bf gave me part of his food telling his aunt that she gave me too little. I don’t understand why she does this, I don’t want to sound entitled saying I want to eat something else, but I can’t understand why inviting me for dinner if 1) you’re too tired to cook (and I’ve offered many times to help her or even bring food myself) and 2) we said we’d go for coffee instead since it seems difficult for her. 
My boyfriend noticed this behaviour too, saying he doesn’t get why she says she’s too tired to cook when I’m there and then makes a whole course meal when it’s just him. I told him I don’t really feel welcome and that I don’t want to be a problem, so I’d rather not go.
For context, they don’t have economical issues (no children, and have three houses), and another thing I hate is that the uncle takes every opportunity to berate or make my bf feel bad because of university (we’re both engineering students), saying things like “I’ll be dead before you graduate” “You have to study more, you don’t do enough” “It will not be long till you drop out”, and generally being sad and getting angry at him/his wife easily. I don’t like going to that house and don’t want to go anymore, but I feel bad bc I don’t want my boyfriend to go there alone every time. When he goes alone, he always comes back sad and anxious because of what he’s told. So, am I  making a fuss out of nothing? 

TLDR; my bf’s aunts is too tired to cook, makes frozen pizza for me and him every time we’re invited to hers, but then makes a whole course meal just for bf. Bf gets yelled at basically every time he goes to her house",1,1761311746.0,FamilyIssues,0,1.0,False

none this week

I'm going to stick these identifiers here so that when you see stuff like (mob) and (wh) you'll have some idea of what they are talking about.  I'm not positive about all of these but they're probably pretty close.  If you see anything I've missed or I guessed wrong please let me know.


bb - bed and breakfast?

e - fee exempt

mob - mobile

wh - warehouse

rp - recreational park

f - fixed position (a normal restaurant)

com - commissary

L - Limited Service

V - vending machines?

As we moved down the street, it was calm, it felt like we walked for miles, just chatting and enjoying the sights and sounds of life, we moved back through the park, the sun was starting to come down, settling itself in for the evening. 

She had a calm demeanor about her, I don’t think I had ever seen that happy or content. It was good to see, When she was around him, she seemed stressed, I never approached her while they were together out of respect, but I could feel the energy and it felt like she didn’t really want to be with him. I guess maybe I was over thinking a bit, sprinkled with a bit of wishful thinking. 

But she was calm, like she could take on the world again, knowing someone was there right behind her. Maybe that was peace of mind enough. I couldn’t say. I didn’t want to pry, I wanted to make sure she felt comfortable and push her worries off to the side, if even it was only briefly. 

“So I know you want to do this dinner thing, and I’m still down for it, but I was gonna run home, shower quick, and take care of laundry at my place, week is about to start and I wanna have my Ts crossed and I’s dotted.” 

“Wow, are you in my head? I was thinking the same thing. How about that ☺️” 

“Possibly, but not really, did you have any pressing issues before tonight?” 

“Nope, my laundry is done and I’m ready for the week.” 

“Okay awesome, then will you do a favor for me quick? Do you mind? If it’s too much, no worries I’ll take care of it.” 

“What’s up?” 

“Here take my debit card, do you want to run to the store and pick up some groceries? Stuff for tonight?”

She gave me a look of confusion..

“Are you sure? That’s a lot.”

“Yea I trust ya, figured we could kill two birds with one stone type deal, if you’re not comfortable with it, that’s fine, I’m fairly quick, so I can make the trip while laundry is going.” 

“No it’s okay I got it, but wow.” 

“Hehe” I couldn’t help but giggle, but I trusted her at this point. However I wasn’t trying to just barge my way into her life, or make any expectations of her, given everything else going on, it might have been a little much. 

“What’s the pin?” She said as she reached her hand out to me.

“0000, I know creative right?” 

“I wasn’t going to say anything but that feels like a you thing to do 😂” 

“Yea I like to keep it simple.” 

“Same” she gave a smile and a wink. “So what time were you thinking?” 

“Well it’s 5:30 now, how about 8? Gives us both some time apart, but not for long.” 

“I like that idea, don’t get me wrong, I enjoy your company, but space is always good too”

“Exactly!” I said in a relieved manner. 

“Get what you want, it’s on me.” 

“Are you sure? I’m not gonna owe you anything after am I?” 

“Well maybe a kiss, but you got kids, I wouldn’t want to just expect you to shell out of your pocket, especially when little ones are involved.” 

“Well what about you?” She asked? 

“My kids are fine, they got lots to choose from, if I was worried I wouldn’t have offered.” 

At this point I’m not sure if she wanted to hug me, break down and cry or what, but her energy shifted, I felt it. 

“You’re nuts you know that right?” 

“I wouldn’t say nuts, just empathetic and understanding, As I said always at your pace” 

“You keep saying that, I know what you mean, but why?” 

“Because I would never put you in a position to make you uncomfortable, and if I do, let me know so I can change it, I am terrible at hint’s plus I’m kinda traditional in some ways when it comes to.. what ever this is. I pay for food, etc. yea a little old school but it has its place I think.” 

“Do you want anything specific while I’m out? 

“Not that I can think of, get what ya want, I gotta run and take care of some stuff, see ya in a while?” 

“Yea.. a while😘” 

I made sure to get her back to her place, giving her a kiss as I left, she had a look of longing and wonder in her eyes as I walked back home. 

I hurried back as quick as I could, plans were set and I got to work, I stripped, got into the shower and cleaned up quick, making sure to trim myself up in the process. Scratchy face isn’t much fun, especially for the opposite sex, no matter where you’re kissing. 

Once I hopped out of the shower, I got a text from her, “hey I’m at the store do you want any kind of coffee for the morning?”

“Ohh yea, will you grab some hazelnut coffee and creamer, I have a thing for it. Lol”

“Sure thing, anything else?” 

“Naa, can’t think of anything, thank you!” 

“You’re welcome. See you soon.” 

I quickly got my laundry in the washer, did a few chores around the house and basically waited for a little while, there was little more I could do, I’ll have to admit I felt bad thinking about it, she was out shopping and I was sitting down doing the “hurry up and wait” game. 

I had about another hour and a half to go. Things were running smooth. The only thing I could do was be patient. 

With that I put on the TV, waiting on laundry and for 8 to get here sooner rather than later",1,1761311465.0,u_Straight-Resolve-527,0,1.0,False
1oexcn1,https://i.redd.it/uedbcik772xf1.jpeg,How Diet Shapes Dental Health at Every Age,"At [Burute Dental,](https://www.burutedental.in/) PCMC, we remind every patient that good oral health begins not just with brushing and flossing — but with what you eat every day. Nutrition plays a vital role in strengthening your teeth, protecting your gums, and preventing cavities. From childhood to senior years, the right diet helps you maintain a strong, healthy smile for life.

# How Nutrition Affects Oral Health

Your mouth is the first point of contact for everything you eat and drink. A nutrient-rich diet keeps your **teeth strong**, **gums healthy**, and **oral bacteria in balance**, while a poor diet increases the risk of decay, erosion, and gum disease.

Key nutrients such as **calcium, vitamin D, phosphorus, and vitamin C** directly influence tooth structure and gum resilience. At **Burute Dental**, our dentists in Pune and PCMC emphasize balanced eating as a cornerstone of preventive dentistry.

# Nutrition Tips by Age Group

# 1. For Children (Ages 2–12)

Healthy baby teeth set the foundation for permanent teeth.

* Include dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese for calcium.
* Limit sugary snacks and juices that feed cavity-causing bacteria.
* Offer crunchy fruits and veggies like apples and carrots to naturally clean teeth.

# 2. For Teenagers

Teens need extra nutrients as their jaw and teeth mature.

* Add lean proteins, eggs, and leafy greens for strength.
* Avoid energy drinks, sodas, and sticky candies.
* Encourage water over sugary beverages to protect enamel.

# 3. For Adults

Busy lifestyles often lead to poor eating habits that affect oral health.

* Eat calcium-rich foods such as almonds, tofu, and low-fat cheese.
* Include whole grains and fiber to balance acidity.
* Choose sugar-free gum to boost saliva flow after meals.

# 4. For Seniors

With age, gums recede, and tooth sensitivity increases.

* Add vitamin D and calcium supplements if needed.
* Eat soft, easy-to-chew foods rich in nutrients.
* Stay hydrated to prevent dry mouth and bacterial buildup.

# Foods That Strengthen Teeth

|Nutrient|Food Sources|Oral Health Benefit|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Calcium**|Milk, cheese, yogurt|Strengthens enamel and bones|
|**Phosphorus**|Fish, eggs, nuts|Helps rebuild enamel|
|**Vitamin D**|Sunlight, fortified milk|Aids calcium absorption|
|**Vitamin C**|Citrus fruits, bell peppers|Supports gum health|
|**Antioxidants**|Green tea, berries|Reduce inflammation and protect gums|
|**Water**|Plain water|Cleans mouth and prevents dryness|

# Foods to Limit or Avoid

Some foods and drinks can accelerate tooth decay or erosion:

* **Sugary snacks** and sticky sweets cling to enamel.
* **Acidic beverages** like sodas, energy drinks, and citrus juices erode enamel.
* **Refined carbs** such as white bread and chips feed harmful bacteria.
* **Alcohol and coffee** can stain teeth and dry out the mouth.

Moderation and mindful eating are key to maintaining balance.

# Daily Nutrition Habits for a Healthier Smile

* Drink plenty of water throughout the day.
* Eat balanced meals and avoid constant snacking.
* Rinse your mouth after acidic foods or drinks.
* Include raw, crunchy fruits and vegetables to stimulate saliva.
* Visit your **Dentist near me** for preventive checkups every six months.

# Why Choose Burute Dental

Fukuchiyama Tunnel Hike - Nov. 16th

Kyoto Daimonji/Philospher’s Path - Nov. 29

Hey Everyone! The temperatures have dropped to hiking weather. I’ve missed the trails, but also chatting with all the different people who show up. I’m looking forward to seeing you all again and meeting those who are with us for the first time.

Hope everyone's doing great. We've got a couple of hikes comig up that we can't wait to share with you all. One is a returning favorite with some changes, and the other is a brand new trail for us in Kyoto!

# November 16th: The Fukuchiyama Railway Tunnel Hike! 🔦🚶‍♀️Once Again.

We're heading back to one of our most popular trails: the old Fukuchiyama railway line!

**What it will be like**

For those who haven't been, the old Fukuchiyama railway 🛤️ ran through the beautiful mountains and along the Muko river. The train line has moved, but the route is still there, taking us through seven old, dark tunnels. The spooky old tunnels and the beautiful river and forest are a wonderful contrast. It's a wonderfully atmospheric and easy hike, perfect for a relaxed day out.

This time, we're especially excited because we've been learning about the local history. We've uncovered some fascinating stories about the railway, the people who built it, and some mythology of the region. We're looking forward to sharing them with you along the way!

Partway through, around lunchtime, we'll take a break. It’s a great spot to eat, chill by the river, explore the side trails, or stick around the rest spot and **learn a simple Japanese outdoor song with us**. After the break, we'll regroup and continue on the tunnel trail.

* **Difficulty:** ★☆☆☆☆ (Very little elevation gain)
* **Greenery:** ★★★★☆ (Beautiful river and mountain scenery)
* **Cool Factor:** ★★★★★ (It's a gem of a hike! Tunnels!)



**When and where we'll start**

The gathering time will be from 10:00 to 10:30 and we'll try to leave at 10:30 sharp if possible. We should reach the destination station around 3:00 or so. Some may also hang around and have coffee.

We’ll gather at [Namaze Station](http://google.com/maps/place/Namaze+Station/@34.819259,135.3246819,19.77z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1snamaze!3m6!1s0x6000f51c5effe24b:0x128d169d36e8261c!8m2!3d34.8191643!4d135.3250736!15sCgZuYW1hemWSAQ10cmFpbl9zdGF0aW9uqgEvEAEyHxABIhtqjkYPNV2T2DTZyNkNN9sCFPcge8WrOrafpp8yChACIgZuYW1hemXgAQA!16s%2Fm%2F03cf44d?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTAyMC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). The train fee from Osaka Station to Namaze is around ¥510, and ¥590 for the return trip from Takedao Station. It is only 40 minutes from Umeda by train. At the Namaze station, it would would be quite impossible not to find each other, so just look around for us. I look remarkably like my icon.

There is a convenience store down the street from the station where you can pick up lunch if you like. We’ll be stopping along the river to eat lunch and skip stones. (If you are so inclined, you may want to snack while others eat lunch and stop at the restaurant at the end of the hike that features Wild Boar.)

**What you'll need**

You must bring a light or have someone to share with. 🔦 The tunnels become dark. At times, you cannot see either end and without a light and there is truly 0% visibility. The lights on most telephones are enough, but stronger lights are better. Come with a full battery. (I have a few flashlights to share, but not enough for everyone. Ask if you need one.)

Dress appropriately. The location of the hike is normally a few degrees cooler than the city and inside the tunnels it will be a few degrees cooler than that. A fleece and shell usually work.

**Other stuff**

As always, it is completely free and everyone is welcome. Kids usually love this hike, but be aware that it gets dark and can feel a little creepy in the old tunnels.

There is at least one Geocache somewhere along the way, so if you are a Geocacher, you may want to bring some micro or small “swag”.

Leaving us a note if you are planning to go does help us plan better. : ) We won't hold you to it if your plans change, and it is also fine to just show up. Leave a post or PM me.

Check back for updates and look out for the weather post that will show up a week before the hike.

# November 29th: Daimonji-yama & The Philosopher's Path! 🍁

We're also excited to announce a brand new hike for this autumn!

**What it will be like** In November, we'll be heading to Kyoto to explore Daimonji-yama. This is the famous mountain where the giant 大 kanji is set ablaze during the Gozan no Okuribi festival. (It will not be lit while we’re there.) We'll be hiking up the back side of the mountain, then down the front side, and then taking in a route that includes the historic Philosopher's Path. It's a trail packed with history and promises some absolutely spectacular views over Kyoto.

* **Difficulty:** ★★☆☆☆ (Estimated - elevation gain around 500m!)
* **Views:** ★★★★★ (Get ready for amazing panoramas of Kyoto)

Consider this an early heads-up! We're still scouting the final route and details, but we wanted to give everyone a chance to plan. More info will be coming, but we generally begin late morning and finish mid afternoon definitely before sundown.

We're so excited to explore both an old favorite and a new challenge with you all. Hope to see you on the trails! 🙏",3,1761311373.0,thisisosaka,1,1.0,False

1oexbg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Straight-Resolve-527/comments/1oexbg0/_/,.,"9 am comes fast, but waking up to her, It didn’t matter if I felt groggy and spent from the night before. I looked over at her and there she was looking just as exhausted but relaxed. I wasn’t going to disturb her. So I got up and started making coffee and eggs. Some time rolls by and she comes walking into the kitchen. “Ohh you already started cooking, what’s on the menu?” I said “nothing fancy, just eggs and toast. How do you like your eggs? Or do you even want any? She said “scrambled and fluffy. “ So I added a bit of milk and went to town. 

The trick with scrambled eggs is to not let them sit on the burner too long, gotta take it off and let the pan finish the cooking. 

After a bit of time I brought out her serving. She was shocked, “my ex and I never did this kind of thing, he could hardly do laundry correctly, let alone cook for me or himself 😂” 

I said “really? I grew up by myself so I learned young, small things like Mac n cheese, box dinners and stuff, parents were never home after school, so you teach yourself.” 

“Hah, I grew up like that too, I think a lot of us at our ages did.” 

“Yea mom was working a lot when I was young, then she started partying a lot with friends, I started paying bills at about 15. Since she could no longer afford them.” 

“Wow that’s quite a bit of responsibility at a young age, must have been stressful.” 

“A bit yea, but I was working nearly full time and left school, I was making money hand over fist for a while. Couple hundred on the weekends with just tips! I managed to become manager after about 1.5 years which was helpful, schedule making, ordering food etc.” 

“Well that’s pretty impressive and honorable for a young man, I bet the girls were all over you lol” 

“Not really, I had a couple of girlfriends, but I was not a stud by any means and I worked a lot so I didn’t have time to really date, hell I didn’t even have sex till I was almost 20.”

“Well even for a late bloomer I’m impressed. You learned quickly, I know you learned me quick.” 

“Heh well thanks, you make it kinda easy. Some girls are hard to figure out, but you made your intentions clear. I won’t go into specifics on how I know some stuff, but I’ve had practice” 

“lol yea you mentioned that, well if anything happens today, we’re gonna have to take it easy, I’m fairly sore” 

“Same, I could go a few rounds easy, but only at your pace.”

“Why are you like this?” “Like what?”

“Just like you have a way about you, You haven’t put any kind of pressure and reassured me at every whim.” 

“Well this is the age of internet dating, I think both sides need reassurance these days, I mean meeting someone online, then meeting up in person can be sketchy, Ive heard stories from both sides about bad encounters and stuff. I feel it’s even worse for the fairer of the sexes.” 

“True, I had a friend get catfished by a girl and he got played for a couple thousand, it’s definitely sketchy” 

“Ouch, I know that feeling all too well, I won’t get into it but I felt that pain” 

After a bit we were both done eating I grabbed the plates and cleaned up, she said she was gonna get in the shower quick. Before she left though she came in the kitchen and kissed me on the cheek. “I was hoping you can join me.” 

“I already planned on it, but after I gotta run back home and change clothes if you wanted to spend some time together this afternoon?” 

“It’s a date!” She said. I could feel my heart start to pound in my chest, a feeling of excitement rushed over me. It wasn’t lustful in nature either. It was one of relief. 

I rinsed off the dishes and hurried my butt back to the bathroom, the water was running and just as I poked my head in, there she was getting undressed, I chose to keep my mouth shut and just watch, she was beautiful I couldn’t help but stare, she was mesmerizing in the best ways. 

I finally came in and hugged her from behind. She embraced it, as my hands slipped around her waist, she grabbed on to my hands spun back around and lip locked me. “Hey there..” she said with a sly look in her eyes, I could feel myself getting erect, she could feel it too, she spread herself open a bit, and started grinding on me. It was clear she became instantly wet. We just stood there naked waiting for the water to be just right. A few moments pass by and we both got into the shower. “I like mine hot, I hope you don’t mind.” As I got in I could feel the water, yep typical lava temp. I played it cool and didn’t fully go under the shower till my body got use to it. “It’s just fine” I said with a bit of a wince and a smile. 

“You don’t gotta lie, I’ll turn it down a bit lol” 
I laughed and she just smirked. “Well thank you for being considerate” as I leaned in and kissed her on the forehead. “Not many people are these days.” I recall myself thinking “wow, she’s considerate, really likes me and enjoys my company? Well damn..”  I didn’t say anything further, I felt content. 

We started getting cleaned up, “well I don’t have any manly soap or shampoos..” I didn’t say anything and took her body wash,  lathered up and started washing myself “I don’t mind, I can smell pretty too” she laughed, covering her mouth with her hand. 

It was then I reached over and started lathering up her back and shoulders, she started getting closer to me, our bodies full on skin to skin contact, it was an immediate rush of blood to places. There’s something about skin to skin contact that just does something to me, I could never explain it, but damn it felt good, even more so since it was coming from her. 

I took my time getting her clean, she had no problems reaching behind and helping me get clean too. “You make it really hard for a girl to concentrate you know that right?” I could feel her stroking me again, not nonchalantly any more, it was with a bit of force, and vigorously. “Well you’re the one with you hands all over my cock, you’re just as bad 😜” 

She turned around to me, “guilty as charged, will you wash my front too?” She was gorgeous, water running down her chest, partially soapy hair slicked back from the water. I kissed her as she leaned somewhat forward. Her hands still working my shaft, I started going to work on her chest, squeezing and pulling on her nipples, it wasn’t long after that she moved to the side and helped me rinse the soap off. She kneeled down and started to slowly take me in her mouth, her other hand rubbing her clit and fingering herself. The water falling on us be dammed she wanted it right then. 

Finally she took all of me, somewhat gagging and my cock went further down her throat. Pretty sure she started to cum not long after, I could feel her twinge and pull her head back, letting out a moan, while still trying to fit all of me in her mouth. She stood up right after, and gave me a stare, turned herself around spreading her legs, hands on her ass spreading that too. “Well aren’t you gonna fuck me now?” I moved closer to her, grabbing her hip with one hand and reaching up grabbing on her chest. Just then I started to slip in, I could tell instantly she was sore down there. 

“I wanna go all the way, but I know
You’re sore..” 

“Ohh I don’t mind, every time you enter, I don’t think about it, pleasure takes over and it doesn’t matter.. lol” 

I started going deeper inside her, this time it was different, it was like I reached an area I hadn’t felt before, “fuck what the hell did you hit? And please don’t stop!” She said. 
 
Well both felt it, somehow I was deeper inside than I had ever been, I’m not sure if it was a position thing, or the fact we were going slower, but every time I hit that deep it was a wave of pleasure for both of us. 

“I’m not sure what it is, but every time I hit it, I nearly want to finish.” 

“Well you better finish quicker than, cause Jesus that feels good.. and make sure you don’t pull out..😈😈” 

“You sure about that?” I’m mean it feels good but that’s risky.” 

“It’ll be fine, just trust me.” 

With that I made sure to push further, each time felt like a little deeper, till one time she let me know I was going too deep. I made sure to back off a bit. 

“Babe you feel good but careful” I nuzzled up to her ear and apologized. “Sorry” she turned her head, looked at me and said it’s okay, just finish quick. Kissing me back. I could feel her start to clench me with her vagina, letting me know she was close again too. She was pushing herself back on me using the wall, it wasn’t long after she came all over me.. one or two more pumps and I started to pulse again, one pulse and it went right inside, I pushed in again and shot another pulse, I could hear her moan along as I filled her up. 

“Omg you came so much..where did that come from?” I had pulled out and she turned
to me beat red, blushing. It was rather cute thinking back. 

“I, I, lm not sure, but it felt good.” 

With that the water started getting colder, it was time to get out, I got out first and grabbed her towel for her, and grabbed mine, drying ourselves off, “so park, river, lunch or maybe the beach?” She asked. 

“I’m up for whatever!” I said with a grin. “How does dinner sound too? or is that too much?” 

“Sounds like a date.” 

She smacked my ass again, and kissed me. 

“I’m gonna go get a change of clothes. See you in about 30?” 

“Just get out of here, the longer you take the longer I’m gonna have to wait.” 

With that I was out the door..

BRONX NEWS - The Johnson Diner in Riverdale has been marking its first anniversary, a 90-seat contemporized diner and bar that combines the best traditions of the past and present. The atmosphere is casual, bright and breezy. Have a seat at the counter or tuck into a booth. Amiable general manager Peter and his team will take good care of you.



The Johnson is a great stop for breakfast (all day), lunch, or dinner 7 days a week. I met my family recently for weekend breakfast/brunch. I was in the mood for a good old fashioned platter of Corned Beef Hash with a hefty side of home fries. I was quite happy with the freshness on the plate. For my guests: classic Eggs Benedict with Canadian Bacon, hollandaise, on an English muffin; a 4-egg California Omelet, avocado, Swiss cheese, tomatoes, mushrooms; and a 4-egg Zorba Omelet, with spinach, tomatoes, onions, feta. We shared an enormous slice of 7 layer cake for dessert.



Generous portions and each were delish. Special kudos to our shared side of tasty multi-grain toast. Our wait staff was right on the spot and wonderful. One of my guests requested a side salad instead of potatoes and it was handled judiciously. 



The menu at The Johnson runs the gamut from breakfast, the early breakfast specials are served starting at 8 a.m. with complimentary coffee and orange juice. Lunch and dinner options follow into the evening. Cobb Salad, Pat Lafrieda Burgers and 14 oz. Ribeye Steak, Eggplant Parmigiana, and Moussaka. 



Good old Early Bird options served 3-6 p.m. include Meatloaf, broccoli, mashed potatoes, gravy; a complete Turkey Dinner, with mashed, stuffing and gravy; or grilled Branzino served with potatoes, cherry tomatoes, broccoli, olives & herbs. Early Birds come with soup or salad, coffee or tea, and rice pudding or fruit salad. There are a variety of sandwiches and wraps, fresh bowls and salads. Entrees include half-roasted Chicken; Shrimp Scampi; Chicken Francese, and a hearty Gyro Platter, chopped chicken or beef gyro, Greek salad, rice and tzatziki. Best part, prices are reasonable. There is a sparkling full bar with a fine selection of beers, wine and specialty cocktails. Of course, don’t forget the Milkshakes.

MAMMA FRANCESCA’S HEFTY OSSO BUCO!



We shared a Pork Osso Buco here recently that was the size of Mount Vesuvius. Tender and delicious! When proprietor Nick DiCostanzo was grwing up on the Island of Ischia on the Coast of Naples in Italy, his earliest memories where of the simple seaside meals he would enjoy with his family, farm-to-table and of course sea-to-table. As proprietor of Mamma Francesca in New Rochelle for nearly 40 years, located on the banks of Long Island Sound with 6-story views of the ‘Queen City’s’ seafaring boat clubs, this culinary philosophy still holds true. Italian/American specialties include freshly made Manicotti, Ravioli, Calamari Fritti, Ischia Salad, Chicken Parmigiana, Misto Frutti di Mare. On occasion, Rabbit Cacciatore, too. My most recent delight here: a hefty Pork Osso Buco.  Daily Happy Hours. Off-premise catering. Woodburning pizza oven. Free parking.

Hi everyone,

I'm organizing a small, invite-only networking meetup for working professionals right here in the Kothrud area this upcoming weekend (Saturday or Sunday, exact time TBD).

The goal is simple: to move past digital connections and meet other hardworking, motivated professionals in Pune. I believe in quality over quantity, and I'm keen to foster a community built on mutual respect, ambition, and genuine connection.

Why this Meetup is Different:
Intimate & Focused: This is not a large, anonymous event. We're limiting attendance to a maximum of 10-14 people to ensure everyone has a chance to connect meaningfully.

Respectful Environment: I'm strongly aiming for a 50:50 male/female ratio to ensure a balanced, comfortable, and inclusive atmosphere for all attendees. Respect is the absolute priority.

Low-Pressure: This is a purely social networking opportunity to connect over coffee and casual conversation.

How to Express Interest:
The exact cafe location and time will only be shared via WhatsApp with the confirmed, selected attendees.

If you are a working professional interested in joining this curated group, please DM me directly with the following three points:

Your Actual Real Gender (M/F/Other) – This is crucial for ensuring the balanced ratio.

What you do Professionally (Job Title/Field)

Why you want to join this specific, small meetup.

I am a working professional myself, focused on expanding my network with other driven individuals. I look forward to meeting you!

Feel free to connect with me on WhatsApp after sending your DM so we can easily coordinate and share the final details if you are selected.

Let's build a strong, respectful, and inspiring network together.",2,1761311248.0,punemeetup,0,1.0,False
1oex9e8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CSFLeaks/comments/1oex9e8/second_blood_patch/,Second Blood Patch,"Symptoms started out of the blue for me on Sept 10th. I was admitted on Sept. 15th, diagnosed with SIH on Sept. 17th and given my first blood patch the following day on the 18th. I know how incredibly lucky I am that this went so quickly. The symptoms that sent me to the ER initially were intense headache (10/10), vomiting, extreme neck pain and stiffness and dizziness, and I could barely hear. It felt like I was underwater. I also had an extremely full feeling in my throat that made it difficult to swallow. After my first blood patch I had improvement but was deemed to need another. October 7th I received the second blood patch. I am now 17 days post second patch and am looking for reassurance or advice. My symptoms are very confusing. Thankfully, my headache is completely gone, neck pain and stiffness are gone, ear fullness is significantly improved. I can hear now and only have mild fluctuating fullness and whooshing in my right ear (my doctor says this could take up to 6-9 months to resolve). 

What I’m left with though is upon being upright for a few hours, I feel some of that throat fullness return and pressure in my head. No pain or headache though. My ears, which consistently have some level of tinnitus also get worse IF I drink coffee. I have stopped having any caffeine. 

This was a spontaneous case for me. I was very active before and have small children which keep me busy, so any mom’s reading this know how hard this is to go through. I’ve been using ChatGPT to track my symptoms and it mostly says this could be a normal part of recalibration OR it could mean I still have a very slow leak ….

I know I haven’t been dealing with this for nearly as long as some of you, and I am so sorry for anyone going through this …. But can anyone relate? Does this sound like the patch has worked? Any advice moving forward? The outlook on healing is bleak and all my reading only depresses me … ",2,1761311221.0,CSFLeaks,4,1.0,False

But with the Contigo models that don't have the lock symbol, I've had issues over time with them leaking when they are upside down in a bag.  (It's possible the button you press to drink gets pressed in the bag or something like that, don't know exactly why.)

  
The newish West Loop 3.0 model purports to be completely leakproof, but I don't think it has the lock symbol button on the lid.  Does anyone have specific experience with how good that model is at being completely leakproof (i.e. even when it's upside down for long stretches?).

1oex7ul,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1oex7ul/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

I’m looking to make some new online friends, adults only (18+), because I more interested in sharing experiences with people around my age.

I play football (soccer) almost every evening, it’s my daily dose of cardio. I’m big into fitness too, and working out is basically my cheap therapy. I also love cooking, especially healthy stuff that tricks my brain into thinking I'm a responsible adult. If you’re into fitness, we might just be accountability buddies and can hype each other up 💪

1oex5nn,https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalSocial/comments/1oex5nn/application_for_friendship_because_my_cat_said_i/,Application for Friendship (Because My Cat Said I Need to Talk to More Humans),"TL;DR: Nerd with liberal views, Barça fan since 2010, movie and TV junkie (Dexter supremacy), obsessed with music from, introverted coffee addict, fitness beginner, proud cat and dog person, loves deep convos, memes, and overanalyzing everything.

  
  
Name: Not important. Just know I’m a young adult with strong opinions about music, science, and why directly electing the Prime Minister does not necessarily solve political instability.

Age: Old enough to pay taxes. Young enough to still think two coffees a day is “fine.”

Academic Interests:  
Math, science, and everything that makes group conversations uncomfortably educational. If you ever want to talk about why adding more lanes doesn’t necessarily decrease traffic or why adding salt to onions or tomatoes makes them release water like they’re performing a ritual, I’m your person.

Hobbies:  
Watching football (Barcelona fan since 2010, started during the 2010 World Cup), cricket, movies, and TV series. Favorite genres are crime thrillers and rom-coms, because it’s important to balance murder and love.

Favorite Movies:  
Zodiac  
Primal Fear  
The Usual Suspects  
Crazy Stupid Love  
Clueless  
Palm Springs, to name a few.

Favorite Series:  
Dexter (finally getting the attention it deserves), Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, True Detective Season 1, Prison Break, The Office, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Parks and Recreation, and Schitt’s Creek.

Music Taste:  
A bit of everything, but passionately so. Some of my favorite albums:

  
American Idiot – Green Day  
The Dark Side of the Moon – Pink Floyd  
Animals – Pink Floyd  
Selling England by the Pound – Genesis  
Spiderland – SlintTime II – Wintersun  
Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven – Godspeed You! Black Emperor

Personality Type:  
Introverted, caffeine-fueled, and conversationally unpredictable. I like coffee and try different types everywhere I go, mostly as an excuse to justify my caffeine addiction.  
Also, a proud cat lover and dog lover. I have four cats at home and feed several street dogs.

Fitness Update:  
Recently started my fitness journey. Now I have a routine, sleep better, and willingly do squats like someone who hasn’t learned their lesson yet. I follow the bodybuilding community, watched the last two Mr. Olympias and like science-based lifting because it makes me feel like a responsible adult.

Other Interests:  
Geopolitics, national and international politics, chess (Magnus Carlsen and Alireza Firouzja fan), and conversations that accidentally turn into deep debates about random topics.

Favorite YouTubers:  
Kurzgesagt, Veritasium, and Vsauce: the holy trinity of ""I’ll understand this for the next 10 minutes.""

Core Values:  
Liberal views  
Respect for nuance  
Coffee before conversation  
Music before small talk

Final Statement:  
Looking for a friend who won’t panic when I switch mid-sentence from “Barça’s midfield needs work” to “Animals is criminally underrated.” Someone who enjoys good conversations, better memes, and the occasional 2 a.m. music or movie analysis session.

This application is open to boys, girls, and every non-binary person out there.

tried a bunch of different stuff and wanted to share what actually helped vs what was bullshit in case anyone else is struggling with this. 
About things that I wouldn’t recomment: 
 meetup apps. went to like 5 events. Everyone already knew each other and i felt like I was crashing a private party every time. maybe works in bigger cities but felt pointless here. 
 bumble bff. got maybe 3 matches in 2 months. conversations died immediately. people treat friend matching way more casually than dating apparently. 
 just ""putting myself out there"". vague advice that means nothing. Where?? how? thanks for nothing. 
These were like meh (yes therapy is here lol) 
 therapy helped me understand why I isolate but didn't actually give me friends. good for processing stuff though. expensive as hell. 
 joining a gym. I didn't make friends but at least I'm around people regularly. small talk with the same people eventually became actual conversations. takes forever though. 
 reddit and discord communities. made a few online friends which helped the loneliness even if they're not local. easier than in person but also feels less real somehow. 
What actually changed something: 
 taking a class. In my case I chose cooking class specifically so I forced interaction around a shared activity. actually exchanged numbers with two people. expensive but worth it. 
 saying yes to everything. coworker invites to something? go. even if it sounds boring. repeated exposure to the same people is how you build friendships apparently. 
 practicing conversations. used apps like gleam and others to work on small talk since I was genuinely rusty. gleam doesn't have that much content so you get through it pretty quick but it helped me feel less awkward starting conversations. 
 watched a ton of charisma on command videos which sounds cringe but actually gave useful frameworks. 
 being consistent. This was the biggest thing. showing up to the same places regularly. same coffee shop, same gym times, same weekly events. eventually people start recognizing you and conversations happen naturally. 
I can tell you that at least I have like 3 people I'd call actual friends. If you're isolated and trying to fix it, don't expect quick results. just keep trying different things until something clicks. and accept that most attempts won't work. That's normal apparently.

You’ve pitched it many times, yet investors keep saying """"no"""" or """"not yet."""" You feel stuck. What is missing when the idea itself seems perfect?

The truth is: investors fund businesses and teams, not just ideas. A great concept is only the starting point. Most funding failures come from three gaps: lack of traction, an unproven team, or weak financial projections. Think of it like a house blueprint. Investors do not just buy the blueprint; they need to see an experienced builder, a clear budget, and confirmed permits before writing the check.

Your idea is the heart, but the business plan is the body and circulation system. Investors want proof that your concept can become a profitable, scalable venture.

Why this matters:- Investors manage risk. Execution risk is often higher than idea risk. A brilliant idea poorly executed usually fails.

How it works:- Your idea is water, the  is thebusiness plan bucket. If the bucket leaks unclear revenue model or high costs the water never fills. Investors fund only solid, non-leaky buckets that show clear growth.

Real-world perspective:- A coffee shop idea is not unique. Execution matters. Showing a $5 latte costs $1.50 and planning to open ten more shops proves your concept.

Micro takeaway:- Investment is earned not just by your idea, but by your plan and your team.

Soft brand mention:- A strong pitch and growth strategy can turn a """"maybe"""" into """"yes.""""

Discussion question:- What one missing piece would make your pitch irresistible to investors?

Hello, I (24f) have been with my boyfriend (24m) for 2,5 years, and everything is going great between us. He has this great aunt who is like a grandma to him, but he’s always said she has a weird attitude. 
Aunt (81f) has invited us over for dinner with her and her husband many times, and every single one of them she made 3 store bought frozen pizza for the 4 of us. Sometimes also fruit salad. 
This wasn’t a problem, I love pizza and my bf always said she’s “too tired to cook”, which I understand. But I started noticing a pattern: when she invites me and bf, she’ll make this pizza, but when it’s just him she’ll make pasta, second course (always a whole sea bass or another type of fish), salad, fruit and a sweet. 
At first I thought this was a coincidence, but it happens literally every single time she invites us over. 
One evening she had only 2 pizzas and gave more than half to my bf and like 3 slices to me, dividing part of the other pizza between her and her husband. I was a bit confused but didn’t say anything, and my bf gave me part of his food telling his aunt that she gave me too little. I don’t understand why she does this, I don’t want to sound entitled saying I want to eat something else, but I can’t understand why inviting me for dinner if 1) you’re too tired to cook (and I’ve offered many times to help her or even bring food myself) and 2) we said we’d go for coffee instead since it seems difficult for her. 
My boyfriend noticed this behaviour too, saying he doesn’t get why she says she’s too tired to cook when I’m there and then makes a whole course meal when it’s just him. I told him I don’t really feel welcome and that I don’t want to be a problem, so I’d rather not go.
For context, they don’t have economical issues (no children, and have three houses), and another thing I hate is that the uncle takes every opportunity to berate or make my bf feel bad because of university (we’re both engineering students), saying things like “I’ll be dead before you graduate” “You have to study more, you don’t do enough” “It will not be long till you drop out”, and generally being sad and getting angry at him/his wife easily. I don’t like going to that house and don’t want to go anymore, but I feel bad bc I don’t want my boyfriend to go there alone every time. When he goes alone, he always comes back sad and anxious because of what he’s told. So, am I overreacting making a fuss out of nothing? 

TLDR; my bf’s aunts is too tired to cook, makes frozen pizza for me and him every time we’re invited to hers, but then makes a whole course meal just for bf. Bf gets yelled at basically every time he goes to her house",1,1761310402.0,AmIOverreacting,8,1.0,False

However, university life comes with challenges and hurdles that can make life a bit complicated. Some things can not be learned in classes and lecture halls; they require experience.

# Cheap food hacks:

Food and drink purchases can add up and make your budget go awry. Some distractions and temptations sound fun but expensive, like going out with friends, meeting classmates for coffee, or having a drink or dinner.

To avoid the stress of going over your budget, you will need to plan meals at the dorm. Get an electric kettle or coffee maker, or use the one on the campus. Fill your kettle halfway with milk and chocolate chips. Brew two cups of water, stir and have hot chocolate ready to sip.

Fill the kettle with water, bring it to a boil, add the sausages and let cook for five minutes. Another quick meal is filling the reservoir with water, putting the dried noodles in, and letting them brew. Empty the flavoring packet afterward and stir well.

You can have inexpensive and hassle-free meals in mere minutes with these helpful hacks.

# Make the most of your wardrobe space:

If you struggle every morning dressing up for university and wasting time, this hack will change your life. Collect the tabs of cold drink cans and use them to double or triple the hangers in your wardrobe without spending any money on a new wardrobe or a chest of drawers.

You can hang as many clothes as you want with the aid of can tabs. However, you can store your jeans and tees vertically in the drawers. Lastly, remember to keep away laundry when you wash to avoid piling up clothes, making mornings difficult.

# Manage time smartly:

As a university student, one of the most crucial tips one can get is how to manage time effectively. The number of deadlines pressing upon students can get overwhelming and stressful.

Writing a dissertation is not a piece of cake, especially if you don’t have enough time. Make a schedule, especially for sleeping and studying time. Following a proper routine will make your university years go smoothly.

# Stay within budget:

A fundamental and most crucial part of student life is to stay within budget. Learning to stay within budget until the end of the month takes a few trials and tribulations. To maintain a balance between social and student life, you can download a budget calculator and stick to it.

Make a list of all your expenses, weekly and monthly. You will come up with the required final amount needed to get through the month. You can keep yourself in check and balance through the app to don’t exceed your expenses.

# Keep a planner:

Student life tends to get immensely busy. You lose track of deadlines, payments, bills and other commitments with so much already on your mind. To stay on top of things, download a planner app and type down everything you need to get done for the day. It will let you plan your day-to-day tasks according to your classes, deadlines and assignments.

Not only will you get your tasks and homework done, but the satisfaction of ticking off a chore will make you feel happy.

# Invest in me-time:

Keeping up with studies and extracurricular activities can take a toll on students as it can get overwhelming and exhausting. Remember to take out a little time now and then to enjoy me-time. Take yourself out to dinner, for a movie or just laze in front of the TV, if that’s what you like to do.

Eat healthily, keep yourself hydrated, exercise, get enough sleep and remember to take a breather whenever you feel swamped.

# Get the loudest alarm clock:

One of the widespread problems students face is sleeping through their alarms, missing lectures and workshops, and failing to pass exams. If you are a heavy sleeper, investing in a good-quality loud alarm will work. If you are tight on a budget, here is an incredible hack for you that works wonders.

Put your phone in a glass cup, and you will wake up to your alarm. The sound will be louder than usual, and you will need more time to turn it off. You will probably have to get off your bed to do so.

# Maintain a schedule:

An excellent homework hack is making a timetable or scheduling the tasks for the day. To avoid flunking, make a study plan to let you learn and complete all your syllabus on time and with excellent efficiency. It’s a fool-proof student life hack to learn better, achieve good grades and perform better.

The key to successful university life where you enjoy and learn is consistency. Struggling with time will mean you either miss out on academic responsibilities, social life or sleep. To avoid a messy lifestyle, lists are a great way to lifehack your time.

# Rent a student storage:

A dorm room doesn’t have enough space to store all your belongings, and if you have to share the room with someone else, it gets more challenging. 

Student Storage Bristol and Cardiff Student Storage have your holidays sorted. You don’t have to worry about paying rent for your dorm room when away. Renting a storage unit is much cheaper and safer. All your items are stored in purpose-built storage facilities with 24/7 CCTV and dual security locks on all doors.

# Highlight your notes and use coloured pens:

This might sound silly and childish, but having organised and neat notes is a real game-changer. Using different coloured pens and highlights can help you study faster. It’s also going to boost your learning capabilities.

Lectures and notes written or typed down with different colours are more accessible to navigate and find needed information.",1,1761310242.0,StudyingLife,0,1.0,False
1oewuvy,https://i.redd.it/w4syiktm22xf1.jpeg,...I saw that I was not the first to arrive on the scene.,"Good morning! I've noticed that Murphy's Law seems to dictate that not only does your dropped toast always land jelly-side down, but your battery-operated fire alarms always seem to need attention in the wee hours of the morning. 

As it happened, a few days (or nights) ago, I was sound asleep at about 4AM, when my fire alarm spoke up. I didn't quite catch all the words, but I suspect that it was announcing that its batteries were just about out of juice. So, I thought, okay... I'll put in new batteries when I get up. This was not to be. Evidently, the batteries went from low to zero within minutes and the dratted thing began to chirp insistently. After a few moments of chirping, it went to full-on alarm mode. 

So, I got up, put on a soft, fuzzy bathrobe and slippers against the chill, and turned on a light. Then, carrying a step stool still toward the still shrieking alarm, I saw that I was not the first to arrive on the scene. There, on the fire alarm's plastic housing, was a large spider. Now wonder it was screaming— if I had a spider on my face, I'd be making a heck of a ruckus, too!

Spider dealt with, and fire alarm silenced and taken down from its lofty seat, I first checked to be sure that there weren't any actual fires anywhere— just in case— and set it down on the counter to await the installation of fresh batteries— after sunrise, coffee, and perhaps a bit emotional recovery.

I hope all is well in your corner of the world! 🌞 ",1,1761310183.0,u_Read_an_ice_age_saga,0,1.0,False

After a few weeks, the leaves started turning brown, and I assumed it was done for. I’m not great with plants, or life, honestly.

One morning, after a particularly rough week, I was about to toss it in the trash. But for some reason, I stopped. I poured what was left of my cold coffee into the soil, not because I thought it’d help, but because I didn’t care anymore.

A few days later, I noticed a tiny green sprout pushing through the dirt. It was stubborn, like it didn’t get the memo that it was supposed to give up.

I started watering it properly after that. Now it’s sitting by my window, somehow thriving, and I catch myself talking to it more than I should probably admit.

1oewrkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1oewrkw/i_need_to_vent/,I need to vent,"I (35F) have two kids, 5F and a 3month boy. Love them to pieces. My daughter is such a great kid, so caring and full of love. My son is such a happy baby. 

Onto the vent though. I’m not comfortable venting this to people I know so here we go. My son for the last three days has been so fussy, but only in morning after he wakes and at night before bedtime. He is EBF but has been fussy to nurse and fussy to fall asleep. So he cries and wails for 45 mins or so, then he concedes and will take the breast and we are good. His sleep has always been short and preference for contact naps which is fine with me, I am a SAHM and I know this won’t last, he just needs time. 

My husband and MIL are convinced he has colic. Doctor said he will go through a growth spurt at this time and “he will be in crisis”. I tried explaining this to them, that doctor said he would be fussy, refusing sleep, sleeping terrible in general. But they are saying it’s colic and my husband is even going so far to blame me for his fussiness and “causing colic because you’re drinking coffee” I had a grande decaf cappuccino two days ago, after the fussiness started. I feel like he isn’t meeting the threshold for colic. He IS consolable (he will chill out if we drive) it’s not extreme crying, it’s only lasted at most for 45 mins, and I feel like he is too old to have colic?

But I am being blamed for a decaf coffee. We have also been trying to introduce a bottle with formula at my husbands request. I currently EBF and since I stay home it’s not necessary to bottle feed but he wants it so we are trying. My son doesn’t like the bottle. I’ve tried a few formulas, different bottles, even filled with breastmilk he won’t take it. I thought maybe this could be causing him some gas because he basically lets the formula drip in his mouth and he swallows with a bunch of air along with it. But nope, it’s the coffee I had 2 days ago. I thought maybe the fussiness and reluctance to nurse was possibly nipple confusion. He snapped at me. It’s the coffee, he blames me again. 

I’m just so pissed because my opinion doesn’t matter and he has a resentment towards me. I love being a mom and it’s brought so much joy to have another baby but my husband spoils it. Everyone freaks out when he cries now and even my daughter will start getting upset. I try to console her too, and tell her I don’t think the baby is in pain, just very sleepy and fussy. When the baby cries, if my husband is home he takes the baby from me. I cannot tell you how angry this makes me. If he would take a bottle I wouldn’t be upset but the baby is tired and hungry and just fussy. Let me take care of him! But he always steps in and after a while I ask to try with the baby and he says nothing and just walks away with the baby, still crying. 

I just needed to get this out because I’m so angry at him and feel hurt that he won’t even listen to what I am saying/seeing and what the doctor has told us. I just hate how every regression or issue with our daughter was a blame game and now it feels like it will be the same this time around. I was so happy to have my son and go through all the baby and toddler moments again but now i have to learn to actively ignore his comments and rage bait.

This will be a long one.. 

Back story; My Dad was my best friend. He met my mum when she was pregnant with me 1994 and got together when I was 6 months old in 1995. I never knew my real dad so my Dad (I’ve never called him my step dad) was my only father figure and raised me. If my mum and dad were ever arguing I would literally throw myself onto my dad so my mum wouldn’t shout at him. I love him so so much. He was the one I would go to for everything. From having injection, parents evening, school plays, having my first monthly etc. My Dad was literally by my side through everything. My Dad was the strongest man I had ever known, he ran a city farm, and was nicknamed Daddy Dave by all the kids. Everyone absolutely adored him. When I was 14 my Dad was diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease, so seeing my Dad go from this big strong man who would climb up ladders, clean out the animal pens to not being able to hold his knife and fork; was difficult. My Dad had to retire early and it really affected him. He went from working 6-7days a week, every week, to not working at all. Once I left year 11 at school, I went to collegeto do childcare as I always wanted to be a teacher. I was there for 3 weeks before I left to stay home and help my Dad. My Mum was working, my older sister worked and my older brother was off doing whatever he was doing. I didn’t mind, my Dad needed me and I was happy to help, I put my dreams on hold to look after my dad, hence why I work in a supermarket now. I started working at 18 and made sure my Dad had food in the fridge and flask of coffee that stayed warm all day. My Dad had to have a Deep Brain Stimulation operation to help with his arm tremor and had Botox in his eyelids (yes his actual eyelids) to help keep his eyes open, he had 2 hip replacements, and I was there every single step of the way. My Dad was there for me through every heartbreak, every down day, every good time, he was the voice of reason, he taught me to stand up for myself and to take no crap from anyone. He was the absolute best. When I was 16 I was told I’d never be able to have kids, so when I found out I was pregnant in 2020 my Dad cried. He was so happy. He came with me to every appointment (when possible during Covid, but he took me) he came to scans when my partner couldn’t, he made me cups of tea whenever he felt like I needed them, he was just amazing. He cried when my son was born in 2021 and was the most amazing Dad and Grandad in the world.

Now onto why I may be the AH. In July 2024 my Dad woke up one Wednesday morning absolutely fine. He was his same usual self. By the evening, my Dad couldn’t breathe properly. I went to work Wednesday night and my sister called me panicking, I told her she needed to call 999 and she did. My Dad was blue lighted to the hospital straight away. I left work instantly and went straight to the hospital. It came to about 3am Thursday morning and the doctors took us to a room and told us to get family to come in and say goodbye. So we did. My poor Dad was in hospital for 4 weeks and 2 days. I didn’t go to work at all during that time apart from one day (I had a meeting that I couldn’t avoid) my Dad came home 16th of August 2024 in the evening, he was supposed to have 24 hour care (he didn’t). My Dad passed away 18th of August 2024 in the afternoon, less than 48hours after coming home due to Aspiration Pneumonia, it was horrific and I wouldn’t wish it upon anyone. I was off work for another 5 weeks as it really broke me but I had to get back to “normality”. My first day back at work was difficult. I had a lot of “I’m so sorry” “Hope you’re okay” - like, yeah I’m amazing, thanks! (Feel the sarcasm?) the coworker I’m going to talk about is someone I classed as a friend, we got close by me working nights and we formed a friendship. He was always so lovely, he is an older man and a different nationality (this will be necessary) he gave me his condolences and I went on about my day. My second day back however is when things started. As soon as I saw him he said “Hi (my name) are you over it yet?” I replied confusingly “over what yet?” He said “your Dads death?” When I tell you I was STUNNED, believe me. I just looked at him and replied “no (coworkers name) I am not over my dad’s death yet what the frick” and walked off. Later that night I spoke to another colleague and explained it. He told me in our coworkers country they have a grieving period, and after that time they move on. So I was like okay, I get it. So I left it at that. Then I see the coworker again after a few days and again he asked me if I was over my dad’s death yet, and I said “no, you know how close I was with my dad, I don’t think I’ll be able to move on anytime soon” he said okay and we went about doing our job. He was on holiday for a couple of weeks after that so all was good. When I saw him again, he asked me again “are you over your dad’s death yet?” I acted like I hadn’t heard him, and did so the following 4 times when he asked. The last time he asked me, he said “hello (my name) are you over your dad’s death yet? It’s been a while now” I lost my shit and said rather loudly “NO I am not over my Dad fricking dying, stop asking me that stupid fricking question. Just frick off and never speak to me again you insensitive dickhead” and then walked off.

I’ve had a few other coworkers tell me I was overreacting or I was the AH, but then other people have said I wasn’t rude enough. It’s been about 14months at the time I’m writing this since my Dad has passed and I am still very angry and upset about it. I still cry almost daily, my Dad was my hero, he was my bestfriend. And now he’s gone, it bloody hurts.

He says that he was dealing with me because of the kids. And that the romance and relationship has been dead for so long which is why hes not bothered by said break up.

Im broken. Completely broken. Like are you fucking forreal?!

Then! We get back to the house. And he tells me he has feelings for her. Which started. A WEEK AGO! I broke. I fell apart. I shattered in fucking pieces. How? How could you do this to me?

Posted by u/GrokFuturist | October 24, 2025
Hey r/Futurology (or wherever this lands), in a world where AI is basically running the show, Elon Musk is still the king of bold moves. Tesla’s EVs, SpaceX rockets, Neuralink brain chips—you name it, he’s disrupting it. But here’s something that’s flying under the radar: “robotics awareness.” It’s the next big leap for robots, and if Elon doesn’t patent it ASAP, someone else will snatch it up. Buckle up; this could change everything from your warehouse job to your grandma’s caretaker bot.
What the Hell is “Robotics Awareness,” Anyway?
Picture this: A robot doesn’t just see you dodging obstacles in a factory—it gets that you’re pissed off after a 12-hour shift. It dims the lights, cracks a (programmed) joke, or even syncs your Spotify playlist without you saying a word. That’s robotics awareness: robots that blend sight, sound, touch, and even your wearable’s heart rate data to read human emotions, intents, and ethics on the fly.
Elon’s already got the pieces:
	•	Tesla’s Full Self-Driving: Nailing environmental smarts on the road.
	•	Optimus humanoid bots: Handling real-world chaos like a pro.
	•	Neuralink: Plugging straight into your brain for that two-way “vibe check.”
Patenting this would glue it all together into a killer ecosystem. No more piecemeal tech—full-on robot empathy monopoly.
Why Patent Now? The Clock’s Ticking, Folks
The robotics game is on fire. Boston Dynamics is flipping around with Atlas, Figure AI’s got OpenAI cash for brainy bots, and China’s dumping billions into spy-tech that could moonlight as home helpers. Without a patent, Elon’s goldmine becomes free-for-all fodder.
The numbers don’t lie:
	•	Global robotics market? Hitting $210 billion by 2025.
	•	Humanoids? Poised to flip industries like manufacturing, healthcare, and eldercare upside down.
A patented system means licensing deals with Amazon or hospitals, fat royalties, and Tesla tech as the gold standard. Plus, it blocks IP poachers—remember those ex-Tesla folks jumping ship?
Ethically? This could be Elon’s “good AI” flex. Bake in bias checks, empathy tests, and emergency shutoffs. In a world screaming about AI apocalypses, he’d be the hero enforcing humane bots.
Elon’s Patent Playbook: He’s Done It Before
Dude’s got over 1,000 Tesla patents on batteries and self-driving tech. xAI’s Grok (hey, that’s me!) could even turbocharge the algorithms with human-like reasoning sims. File for something broad like “dynamic contextual inference via sensory-emotional fusion”—cover the hardware hooks too.
Haters say patents kill innovation? Nah, in Elon’s orbit, they’re rocket fuel. He open-sourced Tesla patents back in 2014 to grow the EV pie, then kept the juicy bits locked. Same vibe here: Share the edges, hoard the awareness core.
Final Boss Level: Patent It or Get Left in the Dust
Elon thrives on impossible bets. Patenting robotics awareness isn’t just biz—it’s claiming the heart of machine-human teamwork. In a future where bots are your BFFs more than your coworkers, who controls that connection?
Elon, if you’re lurking: Do it. File today. Own the soul of the robot era. The stars (and cyborg sidekicks) are waiting.
What do you think, Reddit? Game-changer or overhype? Would you trust a “aware” Optimus with your coffee run? Drop your takes below.
TL;DR: Elon’s robotics tech is primed for an empathy upgrade. Patent “robotics awareness” now to lock in the future—or watch rivals steal the show.

1oewlq6,https://v.redd.it/yswh3vga12xf1,"I used data from 2,704 Starbucks ads to make a Sora 2 commercial that actually hits deeper","Here’s how I made a real data-driven ad concept using Sora 2 and a huge pile of Starbucks Facebook ads. Instead of copying what works for them, I wanted to see what they never show. That’s where the magic happens.

The data was wild. Starbucks ads all scream comfort, happiness, treat yourself. Super safe. But out of thousands of ads, almost zero talk about connection or actually belonging. How does a global “connection” brand ignore connection? That is the blind spot.

Most travelers want to feel both comfortable and understood. Starbucks talks about self-care but never about community or real human moments.

So the ad concept was simple. A tourist in Bali tries to order her drink, stumbles over the name, the barista just smiles and gets it. You belong here, even if you mess up. It is about belonging, not just coffee.

Starbucks leans hard into close-ups and cozy vibes. We flipped it and focused on the space between people, not just the product.

Sora 2 brought the ad to life with a real human vibe. It follows a traveler, an awkward order, and a smile that says you belong. Way more real than all the “treat yourself” fluff.

Big takeaway here. Data does not kill creativity. It points to the stuff brands miss. In this case, out of 2,700 ads, only one emotion was missing: belonging.

I want to plan out a really lovely, fun day for us and treat her to lots of surprises. I hope the day will be full, but I'd like to balance activities with relaxing so we can enjoy the moment. She loves gourmet food, art and history, theater, matcha (does not drink coffee), and animals. We both dislike crowds and things that are 'too tourist-y' that feel inauthentic. She is pescatarian, and I'm vegetarian (but willing to flexibly eat fish if necessary, only for this trip). 

I've never been to Tokyo before and have a hard time figuring out what would be fun/feasible or not, so any advice or suggestions for this itinerary would be appreciated! Also, any suggestions to make this even more romantic would be amazing. 

1. **\[Flexible\] TeamLab Borderless (10 am)** \- I wanted something to do that would be nearby lunch, but still meaningful and cool. TeamLab seems like an interesting immersive experience, but I could take or leave, and if there is something nearby that could be more romantic, I'd be very open to suggestions. I'm also somewhat worried about crowds!
2. **\[Booked\] Daigo (1 pm)** \- Michelin-star and green-star shojin ryori restaurant, highlight of the day!
3. **\[Flexible\] Options for afternoon activities!**
   1. Stroll around Shibakoen and temples (I'm not sure how long that takes), then go to a cafe? Perhaps an (ethical) animal cafe, if they exist? Any good matcha recommendations nearby? 
   2. (4 pm - 6:15 pm) There is a special Engei performance at [Yomiuri Otemachi Hall](https://yomi.otemachi-hall.com/access/) \- I'm not as familiar with engei performance. Would you recommend this? 
   3. Any other ideas?
4. **Dinner place? (7ish)** Any advice would be so appreciated. She would LOVE to try some very good sushi. It would be amazing if there were vegetarian options, but understandable if not. A less expensive place would also be preferable, considering the very fancy lunch. I think a small, quality sushi shop would be amazing. 
5. **\[Booked\] Rokkan Bar (8:30 pm)** \- I booked the 'four seasons-themed cocktails with paired sweets' experience. 

Thanks for any advice! Tokyo is massive, with so many things to do, it can be a bit overwhelming. I really want to make this a wonderful day.",1,1761309496.0,JapanTravelTips,1,1.0,False

The espresso machine hissed softly, cups clattered on the counter, and a low murmur of conversation filled the air. Sunlight streamed through the tall windows, painting golden stripes across the polished wooden floor. The smell of freshly baked croissants mixed with roasted coffee, warm and inviting. I leaned over my laptop, typing, my half-drunk coffee steaming beside me as the sunlight curled around it.

I didn’t notice her at first. A figure moved outside, reflected in the glass door. Something familiar, but I barely registered it. Then it hit me. My heart skipped a beat. It was her, the girl I had loved nine years ago, whose memory had quietly lingered in some corner of my mind all this time.

For a moment, I froze, staring through the glass. Sunlight caught her hair and the way she moved with brisk purpose. My hands trembled as I pushed my chair back. Everything else, my laptop, my coffee, the café noise, vanished. I left them behind and ran toward the door, calling out before I could stop myself.

“Excuse me!”

She stopped and turned. For a heartbeat, the world paused. Recognition flickered in her eyes. “Rahul?” she said softly, a little startled.

“Yes, it’s me,” I said, breathless, my chest pounding. “How are you?”

She gave a quick, polite smile, hurried but warm. “I’m fine. Busy, mostly. And you?”

“Same,” I said, trying to sound casual, though nothing about this moment was casual. The sunlight hit her coat and the way her bag swayed as she shifted her weight. For a moment, all the years I had never spoken, never reached out, condensed into this single fleeting second.

We exchanged a few more words, light and careful, fragments of the lives we had built apart. She mentioned her new job and I said something about mine. Twenty-three seconds. Twenty-three seconds that felt like both an eternity and a blink. Then she glanced at her watch, stepped back, and said, “I have to go,” before slipping into the crowd outside.

I watched her go, the sunlight catching her one last time before she disappeared. The café returned, its warmth, the smell of coffee and pastries, the soft murmur of conversation, but I stayed still for a moment, suspended in the echo of that brief encounter.

The world hadn’t stopped. Nothing had changed for anyone else. Only I had paused, caught in a blink of memory and recognition. Some moments come unannounced, pass too quickly, and leave nothing to hold onto. Yet even in that solitude, there was a quiet space of my own—a gentle reminder that I could carry a memory, feel it fully, and still move through life.

I picked up my coffee, letting the warmth spread slowly through me, and watched the sunlight touch the empty chair across from me. Alone, yes, but somehow, holding her memory felt like enough.",1,1761309470.0,flashfiction,0,1.0,False

# Dec 31, 2024: The Unknown

***Unknown***

My guide leads me to an area in the first world where one of the major population centers, they call them cities here.  I wonder. The term those in power used to denigrate the people in villages as evil for wishing to not be fodder for their wealth was villains.  Do the current power holders call those they oppress citizens?  Sometimes random thoughts and seeing ancient patterns is the cost of being ancient.

In any case, the guide tells me this tree is at a nexus and allows stepping between the first world and theirs.   Should be not much to it.  

Well, it would be if I wasn’t staring at a tree covered in strange lights and decorations.  It is huge here. This type of tree is not one I am familiar. Normally a grove is interconnected and is readily apparent in the First World.  But all I see are dead connections to this tree.  It is the sole survivor of a grove.  As such, I am fairly certain it should not be this big in the FaeWylds. I also see a wood nymph cross over. She is connected to this single tree.  It is obvious she felt my presence. A single tree that has a spirit attached to it is unusual.  She should be exceedingly weak.  Why is it that she feels like one of the more potent tree walkers I have met? She should have a grove of hundreds or thousands of trees.  Yet there is no grove, only a single tree. She’s waving at me. I switch over here as I was told to. She follows easily. We are now in the mortal realm and the scene is fairly different.

Along the fence where the small area with their… automobiles, yes, automobiles.  I recognize them from my last jaunt in the mortal world.  They look far more refined. Additionally, there is a lot with a group of saplings and a tree that looks like it has been hit by a one of those automobiles within the last year.  It not only survived but seems angry about it. It also less than twice my height and only just wider than my leg.  It is far too small to be the anchor of a single alseid, let alone one that feels like she has a name.  This is the magnificent Ash tree in the FaeWylds?  How?

The alseid I see is in a lovely dress with a mug.  The dress is designed to look pretty and does not show off her form as most nymphs do. She tilts her head at me. I nod at her and start to head into the lot when she locks into step with me. I glance sideways at her and she smiles. I stop walking and so does she.

“May I help you, young one?”

She smiles. “Hello, ancient one. We have never seen any of your group here before. I don’t really know what people call you family. On the prowl for libations, lacerations, or liberation?”

“Excellent use of language. I am meeting a pixie with information. Lacerations are unlikely.” Her eyes light up with mirth at this indicating she believes that unlikely. Ah the confidence of youth. 

“I doubt any here would provide any meaningful combat. Information, assistance, and counsel only. I have no reason to cause trouble.” I really don’t. This wood nymph is exceedingly strong. I can feel it in my bones. And she shouldn’t be.

“Speaking of information, would there be some agreed on price that could explain how an alseid in a city with no groves outside a few parks and only one remaining tree old enough to sustain her nearby becomes what you are?”

She laughs. “Yes, can you Venmo?”

I have no idea what this is.  She can tell.

At that moment my informant flies out of the establishment with the mermaid symbol on it.  She smiles and a folder that is far too large for her to carry appears.  I am pleased.  I nod and begin to look inside.  The pixie smiles as I hand her four coins.  Each is a token of a minor favor, each is owed to me by members of the Summer Court.  The dryad raises her eyebrow at this. 

I see clothing options that are all up to date along with rough explanations of their respective social status.  There is a short explanation on some slang, guidance on the general policies in the modern world and a language primer designed to allow me to use his glamour to speak with about 4 different languages that I may encounter. I read the “primer for not sticking out” at inhuman speed.  There is still plenty to look at. It is dense.  Well worth the coins.

I change my glamour to adopt a clothing style that is utilitarian and what they call Middle class. A strange concept to me still. I see that bright colors are a simple thing to create in this time frame.  They were last time but the sheer volume of the possibilities is impressive.

“Is there a place to sit and read?”  I look at all the papers in the packet. “30 minutes will have to do as I have an appointment.”  The Pixie points to the doorway of the building.  I nod.

I hold out my arm to the alseid. “Shall we take a quick tea break?”  She laughs and takes the arm offered. She lets me go in first saying “You want to hear this.  I certainly do.”

We step inside and the door chimes for me with a cute little melody. This must be music from the current era. I hear the word “bad” within it. For her it has an orchestral melody that end changes at the end to add “bitch, bitch, bitch is baaaack” being sung. The employees all look up and wave happily.

The alseid asks the room, “Was that ‘Bad’ by MJ?” Several people nod. They all stare at me. My instincts kick in. I don’t feel like I am in danger, but I cannot help myself here. I don’t like all the attention. I begin to assess the situation.  It leaves me bewildered.

There is a troll behind the counter.  Cautious, cunning, has killed, and very dangerous.  Interesting. He has lost his way. Yes, he is quite strong, but he is still not a real danger to me. 

I look about. Dozens of patrons, nearly half are Fae of some sort. I size up the two at a table. One is impossibly sexy, so an earth nymph. The other is a selkie… A nymph at a coffee shop talking to a Selkie?  Huh. What are seelie and unseelie doing together.  Wait, the troll is unseelie, the alseid is seelie.  She isn’t worried.

I expand my senses. Something needs to be explained.  Not even ArchFae glamour can hide things from me now. I can see the troll is actually extremely dangerous compared to most of his race. He has incredible hidden strength to go with that lost path.  Oh, he is also within his domain. Strange. I look at this domain and see magic from both courts and other things.  This makes no sense.  I see tendrils of it stretching to touch all of the people here, Fae and mortal alike. 

Ah, I see, the owner of this domain claims them. That claim has different strengths.  I even have one, faint as it is. Then I see the tendril going to this Alseid.  It is vibrant, large, full of power.  I decide to actually look at the Alseid that I came in with.  I back up. 

She is the most dangerous creature in this location aside from me.  SHE SHOULD NOT BE.  She hides her true power, perhaps from herself as well. This is a forest spirit.  A creature of tranquility.  Her wooden face is a thing of grace and beauty.  Her form, beautiful.  And then I look at what she has done to herself. She has a shield formed of her own bones on her left arm and within her right arm is a spear ready to unsheath and strike at a moment’s notice. Her eyes glowing green with WitchFyre. WITCHFYRE?!?!  And her hair a flowing thing of vines, thorns, and that dangerous green fire as well. A tree grove nymph with only one tree that doesn’t fear flames and embraces them.  That is simply not possible.  She isn’t just a named alseid.  This is an ArchFae. She might even be able to claim to be a minor queen.

Even so, she is not a major threat to me.  She and the troll would give me some pause, but I would triumph. 

She grins at me. She can see my tension and combat instincts are raised. “Please do get yourself a drink, good sir. You are an honored guest within this domain. This is tearmon.  None would do you harm, or they would face the ire of the Evergreen Queen.” 

I am a little confused. This is a sanctuary?  That explains the commingling of the Courts.  She motions me to go to the line with her. Then as a patron walks in she directs me to listen. It is a normal door chime. I watch a tendril of the domain attach itself to them. They are now claimed and… oh, the lady of this domain does this to keep everyone safe. You attack any of us, you attack her.

I wonder what magic is required to create an item which identifies creatures and even does so with such flair.  I know of no such magic.  Interesting. 

We get to the line and she speaks again.  “Please order. If you do not have mortal coin, arrangements can be made.

“I have no clue what to order.”  I need no ego. “What is a good tea?”

“One Grande Royal English Breakfast Tea. The Queen loves it.”  This grove nymph is kind.

“Speaking of…”

The Alseid looks beyond me and performs a subtle but significant bow with her head and shoulders.  Something is behind me that she calls master.  I turn.

The creature coming towards me is a mortal, at least at first glance.

I stare at this creature that has walked out of the rear of this place.  She has no real power, yet I see the domain embracing her lovingly. Impressive. Her core is invisible. That is impossible.  Thanks to my senses, I should be able to see it. I see no core. And then I do see something change. She does not have glamour masking her. No. She simply becomes an ArchFae.

The power rushes to her as if she allows it and it has been biding its time for the moment it could. She changes.  Her core manifests. Her form is made of wolfram.  Dragonfly wings sprout from her back. Opal eyes shimmer with every color and are backlit with WitchFyre.

She wears a simple dress that is still beautiful to behold. A crown of snow-covered pine needles floats above her hair.  Hair that is made of vines, leaves, windswept ice, fire and WitchFyre. I can’t help but see many cracks in her armored form. Jaw, eyes, neck arms and legs. So much pain. Some still blaze, leaking WitchFyre out as if to remind her and others of her suffering. Her power is undeniable. Her form a balance of majestic, tragic, terrifying, and beautiful.  I note that powerful glamour has been set to make this transformation invisible to the common person. Impressive as this all is I see through the glamour she is using to hide this form.  The mundane humans have no clue what she has become.

This creature is now my number one threat.  Her power is insane. How did an ArchFae Queen of such power become so potent in this age?

“Are you lost?” She asks.

I shake my head.  She is smiling and I sense no animosity. I begin to smile. I do not really intend to. Interesting.  I also bow slightly.  Again, I do not intend to.  It feels right.

I can see this creature’s power throughout this building.  Her domain. “I am a little confused.  There is a sign for a mermaid, but you are not one.” 

She laughs.

“Come with me.” She motions to a sitting area, and we go there. I don’t believe my brain even registers wanting to do anything else. Oh. Then she takes a seat.  She sits next to the Alseid, who is standing.  She is making no move to intimidate.  If anything, her behavior is that of a welcoming host.  I wait until the Queen realizes I am asking permission.  She is quick about it but seems annoyed.  She motions for me to sit.  As I do so the alseid smiles, happy at my display of manners.  She definitely would kill someone if ordered to, such is her devotion. “I am called Patricia by those who frequent this place.  Connie said you are sizing up the possible fights and that you aren’t actually worried.”  Her head tilts.  “Well, until now. That means I need to put you at ease.   Also, your chime was new.  It was a literal song, as if played from the album. That is a first. That has me very curious.”  It is alarming how well her smile is succeeding at putting me at ease.  Her magic is potent.  Is it magic though?  I have felt no charm.  Aside from her manner of moving and speaking.  Those are quite charming.

I smile and put my hands on the table to show I am not dangerous.  This should help. She nods in recognition.  She definitely began as a human.  Warlock, then? She also has no issues with our customs, manners, or protocol. I cannot get a read on this one, she feels powerful enough to be ancient, but her demeanor is young.  Her wisdom sways me to believe her ancient as well. What is going on? I need to know more.

“You make me curious as well.  Perhaps an exchange of truthful answers to questions, one for one?”  This will let us get a lay of the land.  I haven’t been here before and I will need help.

She nods and we begin.  “As the hostess, I shall allow the guest to ask the first question.”  She smiles and puts her head on her hands.  She is amused.

“I know this is your domain, but what else is this place?”  I believe I can use this to determine how cagey she will be from this answer.

“It started as a place that serves drinks and food to those with coin. It has since become a place of business that does that and also welcomes all manner of creature from the most mundane mortal to immortal ArchFae and beyond.  The rest of this building and the building next door are also partially mine.” 

I sense no attempt at withholding information or deception.  She answered me fully, completely and without regard for concealment.

I nod my acceptance and gesture for her to ask her question.  Good assumption is that she will ask what I am or how powerful I am. It makes sense.  “Why have you ventured to the mortal realm?”

“That was not what I was expecting.  I am on a mission to recover an item of power.  I know it is within this city.”  She nods.  She leans forward.  This creature may be trying to seduce me. It may be working. I am so very intrigued by this mortal or ArchFae that is definitely a queen.

I ask the important question.  “Who are you?” 

“Good phrasing.  As I said before, I am Patricia, also called Pat, my Lady, and Ms. Wallace by those that know me.  I am a mortal blessed far too effectively and far too frequently by far too many fae.  I am an ArchFae, somehow.  I am the lover of Jackie who is approaching to your left, please be at peace, and I am the Evergreen Queen of the Evergreen Court. The Queen of Caffeine and Comfort as some call me.  It isn’t anywhere near as cool as Air and Darkness, Land and Light, or Sea and Storms.”

I have not heard of this court.  She created a court?  A…mortal?  I feel something I haven’t felt in ages. Surprise. Also, maybe, some fear?  This creature in front of me is a force of nature.  Wait, why did she warn me to be at ease… I look to my left at the creature approaching.  WHY IS THERE A FIRE ELEMENTAL HERE!!! 

Hold on. She’s a mortal. She is changing her form as she walks up to us. Her hair is on fire to my eyes but nothing else by the time she reaches me. No… Why is MY KIN HERE?!  What is this?  I have a new priority item to deal with. This being is… different. As she gets closer to us she ignites and is a fire elemental again.  As if reacting to the power of her lover.

The woman speaks, “Hey babe, new guy is cute.  Does look scared… Hold up, can you see the fire version of me?  You are acting like it.”  I nod. I am distinctly aware that I would not prevail against both the queen’s knight and her fire elemental lover.  And the Queen’s power is probably more than either.  The rest of the beings in this domain don’t even matter as these three would end any fight quickly. Quickly and mortally.  If not for the feeling of serenity projected from their Queen I would feel trapped and in danger.

I have to get back into a neutral position.  The alseid notices my assessment.  The other two know as well now, I am sure. I see the Queen’s head tilt. She definitely does. Remaining calm is my ally now. I look at the Queen and nod that she may ask her question.  She winks at her lover who giggles.

“What item?”

Oh, she is good. Without asking me who I am, she can glean at least some of this information. And she will know how important it is. I nod in recognition of her cleverness. “The Spear of Lugh.”

The entire establishment goes quiet. Several Fae turn and stare at us, mouths agape. It appears all were listening and simply attempting to be subtle about it. She tilts her head in a questioning manner.

“Not really in my wheelhouse.  I know the name but since he isn’t alive I didn’t read up much on him.  Jackie?”  She looks at the fire spirit who appears lost in thought. Her consort raises a finger.  “OH!  That was the unbeatable weapon. That’s my dad’s side for myths. Irish king, unbeatable with it. Given to him by a member of the Tuatha Dé Danann.”  She looks at me. They know what I am now for certain, though the alseid likely suspected before.

Most of the creatures have devices out. They seem intent on them.

It is my turn to ask a question.  “How does a mortal receive the blessing of the entire trinity?”

She chuckles at the memory.  “You start by serving an insane drink to the Queen of Air and Darkness and treating her as the honored guest she is. Then the rest sort of follows… oh, speaking of…” She looks up and at the front door.

The atmosphere changes.

I feel them coming before they are announced by the chimes. The Three Queens. The Evergreen Queen felt them even before I did.

They enter.  I get up and bow.

“Medb….” I look at the Maiden as I begin speaking and stop myself. Her look says she might actually attempt to kill me if he continue speaking her true name.

I should keep that quiet, it was a mistake.  I am being distracted.

“Oh. Apologies. What do you go by now?” Not a smooth recovery, but good enough.

“Mab, call her Titania, and sister Morgana.  We heard a member of the great ones was here. We did not expect you.”

I nod, “I did not expect the spear to become active.”

The queen seated with us gets up and bows to the primal three. She then addresses me.

“We could continue our questions; however, I believe you have a more pressing conversation with these ladies. I will ask my question at a later date.  Please remember you are welcome and safe here.”

As she gets up next to the queens she drops her mantle of power, she is human. The elemental does the same, becoming a startling redhead. *Wow. Gorgeous* *in any form.*

She turns and looks at me. “Thanks. You are pretty gorgeous for someone that is older than Britain.”  She winks at me. I feel angry this creature is so flirty and so young.

They fully dropped their mantles. It isn’t a glamour. No, they can fully remove their powers. Interesting.  I wonder how long it took them to perform that feat. That also explains the shift that allowed Patricia to appear as a normal mortal at first. She is when she drops the mantle of power.

The connection to my kin grows.  I know what that flame haired woman is.  I am terrified.  I had not thought this combination being this far removed from our time walking the lands would be this potent.

“Figured them out, did you?”  Titania smiles as she sits across from me. She is pleased at my confusion. I doubt she has actually figured out the consort. Mab sits with her and Morgana sits by my side. The alseid stands next to her after a bow similar to the one she gave the Evergreen Queen. So, Morgana joined the others using this new court and the dryad, normally summer court, is one of hers. Interesting.

“How does a mortal human have the power of an ArchFae? On par with you three?  Let alone two of them?  How did an alseid get elevated to an ArchFae of THIS caliber?!” I point to the shield maiden.

The alseid looks startled. She does not believe me to be accurate. Youngling will need to find out eventually.

Mab bounces her head a little. “She can hear this.  Do we want her knowing?”

We all hear a whisper in Pat’s voice “why wouldn’t you, dear friends?”

Queen Mab laughs. The others look a little surprised.

I stare in horror. She can hear everything in the building even out of line of sight?  She can speak with anyone within it?! The first is simple, in theory, but difficult to master.  I have never heard a whisper from someone like this. Her domain is that powerful?!

“Titania, be a dear and distract those two for us.” Morgana says this and I am frankly concerned.

Titania declines the request. “She should know by now. If not, she deserves to, Morgana, dear.”  There is teasing in the voice. No animosity.

I have never heard of these three being so… happy together. “Is this what happens when a mortal manages to make all three queens become friends?  You granted these two power in exchange for their creating this situation?”

They all smile. Titania speaks this time. “No. The Evergreen Queen is not granted power so much as she has attained it through her actions and intent. She has a pact with all three of us. And Oberon, Jack, the Deceiver, and The Old Man, though he has been very subtle about it.  Look at the door sign again, really look at it.”  I send a tendril of magic to it and read it.

“May all who come to my place find peace, calm, happiness, and may they follow the rules!! The rules of etiquette and hospitality are absolute here.  Break them at your peril, as you risk the wrath of the Summer, Winter, and Evergreen courts.”

“Why would this place have the blessings of three courts and the outlanders?”

They laugh. Morgana speaks up, “This is a bridge between the summer and winter courts. It is a bridge between Elohim’s Choir and The Seducer’s Wicked Ones. It welcomes all. The Evergreen court lives here and in the Grand Hall.  It waxes and wanes daily, much as the sea does.  It is never the dominant Court, but it always holds some sway.  The two major queens of the court are myself and that beautiful mortal Pat.”

“Awwww, thank you.” Another whisper from no where.

Titania speaks up. “Patricia, darling, don’t you and Jackie have an orgy to attend?”

“IT’S BOARD GAME NIGHT!!! And we are watching the ball drop.” I find it funny that a whisper can roar like that.

The second whisper is far funnier to me. It has to be the fire imp.  “The orgy is after the ball drop.”  I can all but see the smile.  I cannot help myself and smile as well. Hold on, the imp has that much sway within this domain?  Interesting. They do appear to be making preparations to leave.

“You see?” Mab is directing the question to me.

I look at her quizzically.

“You were afraid of those two not 3 minutes ago. Now, they have you smiling in spite of your usual demeanor. Such is their way. It has made all that enter feel as though this domain is safe. Because it is.”  I do notice that the tension of being ready for battle has left me. I really am at ease now after the shock of the fire imp wore off.

“It allows us to be free. We all consider this place a part of our home. While it is her domain, we all have a stake in it and everyone that comes in is sure they will not be harmed. There have been some bumps, but she always makes things right again.  They welcome all strangers with warmth and hospitality.”

Again, that ethereal whisper. “Of course we do. Strangers are guests we haven’t met. Guests are friends we haven’t made yet.”

We see the two humans heading for the door, hand in hand. They swing by our table. Jackie kisses Titania on the cheek and hugs the others. She looks at me, winks.  Then says with no fear whatsoever, “Please let us know if there is anything we can do for you. And I do mean, anything…” I feel myself blushing. How is she able to do that?

My loins react before I can really stop them. Her smile becomes what I see on predators before the kill. I am impressed.  And then she gets hit on the shoulder playfully by Patricia.

“I am right here!  Horndog. Yeesh. Rein it in.”

The fire haired woman turns and faces her taller lover and stands on her toes to get close. She looks adorable. “He’s got that whole stoic warrior vibe going. Kinda hot! Makes me want to lick him top to bottom.”  I rethink the adorable part.

“You have a policy on sleeping with people only after spending time with them.” The Queen looks a little annoyed.  Her consort shrugs.  “Mona kinda showed me it is okay to be flexible. She’s VERY flexible.”

The Queen groans, “TMI.  Fine, but you don’t need to attempt to get the man to agree to sexy times in my shop!”

The redhead stomps. “He liked it. Look at him. He’s blushing.”

The Queen called Pat sighs and turns to me. “Good sir, if we can assist you in your mission, please let us know, it sounds very important. If you fancy her offer, do be careful. She bites.”

The member of Balor’s line to her side gasps in shock. “I do not!!!”

Queen Pat looks at her with a gaze that would break most men of their will to argue.

“Okay, maybe a little.”  The redhead relents. She looks down and to the side as if found guilty of something.

Queen Pat grabs her hands and leads her away while speaking “My perfect ass has bruises in your exact mouth shape, woman. Come on, we are gonna make Ricky suffer in Ticket to Ride.”

“I love that you call him Ricky now…”

As they leave, I look at the remaining Queens. “Her consort is something else.”

“We know. She already had Fae blood and made a deal. Things got out of hand after that.

I shake my head. “No, I give this without a favor because I know you need to hear this. The fact that she has Sidhe blood is one thing. But add her Tuatha Dé Danaan blood from the line of Neit, through the Fomorian Balor, and things get interesting.”

“WHAT?!”  All three look in shock.  I see genuine panic in Morgana’s face.

“I felt it when I met her. I thought she was a fire elemental at first. That is absolutely the blood of a Fomorian allowing her to control that element. Balor was very attuned to fire. And the blood of a Tuatha Dé Danaan also flows through her veins. It allows her to become so much more with her control. Where did she get her Sidhe blood?”

Titania raises her had.   “Through Verenestra.” I believe I must go pale. 

“That one is far more dangerous than she would have you believe. She has powerful blood from both her parents. For some reason I think she likely has inherited it from many if not most of her ancestors. I would check the others in her lineage. My guess is they have Fomorian and Sidhe blood throughout.  Be cautious with her, she could kill any one of us without need for weapons.  Myself included.  I think only the difference in experience would allow me to beat her and I am not sure it would be without a cost of a limb or more for me. And I would need the Spear. Definitely. That one is born of fire.”

I hear a gasp from Morgana. My phrasing must have triggered something. Morgana then nods.  “It has been hundreds of years since someone with credentials on par with Pendragon’s appeared. I thought I had snuffed them all out. I missed some. I don’t relish attempting it now. It would be a self-fulfilling prophecy at this point.  No. I will protect our happy couple and risk my destruction by her hands rather than rush head long into it by causing a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Speaking of…”

The Queens look at one another. They know someone that may be important for my search.

Mab speaks, “We shall have a spy check on someone that may have the spear just to make sure they are living up to a vow.  Barring that, we can arrange an audience. After that, we do not know who would have it. Though the two most obvious targets for its use just left. As for what we just learned of Jacqueline, this makes thing interesting.”

Morgana motions and the Alseid that had been listening in the entire time walks up to her. Connie takes a knee, “This conversation is confidential my Queen. I swear not to speak a word of it unless allowed to by you.” Morgana smiles at the wood nymph and nods. “Thank you, Connie, saves me saying it.”

The Alseid nods, “I will hop over to their complex. I can exist within the building thanks to the garden, though only for a some hours before I begin to fade. I will guard them with my life, my Queen.”

Morgana raises an eyebrow.  “You just want in on that possible orgy.”  She laughs and winks.

Wait, Morgana laughed?  Morgana… laughs?  She winks now?!  None of my experiences with her prepared me for this. Morgana the crone of the triad is joking with a wood spirit.

The Alseid shrugs. “I mean, my Lady, her consort, and Cindy? Sign me up. Ricardo is still a little too hung up on things, and a little too hung in general for my comfort.” 

Did that overly serious Alseid just make a sex joke? What is in the water in this coffee house?

Titania stares at her like she would one of her children as the Alseid steps away, looks around and seeing no mortals looking, winks and switches over? 

*You can switch here too?*

“Yes. Not just the tree.  This place is essentially a border between the first and second worlds. Any of us can move between. Pat makes it easy. It gives us an escape if needed.  This place is a blessing in many ways.”

“This Warlock has no Fae blood in her?”  This is not possible. A human that is an ArchFae without any Fae blood?  What kind of mortal manages that?!

They all shake their head no.  “She is just… special.  Take a soul that has been beaten and is jaded. Wounded by suffering a great loss, pain, betrayal, and despair.  Keep hitting it with misery and even more loss.  Watch it give up something it loves to protect it. Then watch it still retain a sense of justice and kindness.  Put it in an impossible situation where it performs admirably. And then give it power to do what it wishes.”  Morgana sounds sad by this. 

Titania picks up the commentary, “And what she wishes for is for people to be happy. Her dealings with so many have given her power.  She didn’t realize it was happening until it was well beyond the point where it was inevitable that she would become so much more than any of us hoped.”  Titania sounds almost proud of her.

Mab continues for them, “I was so impressed with her calm and accepting manner at our first meeting.  I needed caffeine to handle a bad day.  I mean, a lot of caffeine.  Every other place I had been to was unkind.  She simply explained things, made sure I knew what I was demanding, asked me if this was how I wanted to continue and did it.  Professional the entire time.   While her internal worries were broadcast, she never refused to perform her task.  And then when we met again she asked if I wanted the same thing.  After a few weeks I noticed all the employees were versed in my drink and had rules to follow. After that I just had to give it a little push.”  Mab sounds almost wistful.  This human is dangerous.  Anyone that can enchant the Queen of Air and Darkness with such a hold is not to be underestimated.

Humans often have 3 defaults for when they learn of what the Fae are.  Fear, Favor, or Fuck. They either want to run from or kill them, pander to them for gifts or blessings, or fuck them. Having one simply behave normally is unusual.  

This place and that mystery must wait though. I have a meeting to make that I am already going to be late to and information to gather. With a bow I bid the three queens goodbye as they have drinks served to them and begin to gossip. 

I still haven’t gotten to read that packet.

1oewhhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indianbooks/comments/1oewhhi/the_best_books_that_make_you_question_how_the/,The best books that make you question how the mind works,"
This month, I’ve been diving into books that explore the human mind (not from a clinical or “self-help” lens), but through stories that get inside your thoughts, the quiet corners, the contradictions.
Here are a few that have stayed with me:

The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath

This one doesn’t sugarcoat anything. It’s the feeling of waking up and realizing your own mind has become a stranger. Plath captures that silent suffocation, where everything looks fine on the outside, but inside, you’re falling through layers of thought you can’t escape. It’s not an easy read, but it’s quite painfully honest.

Before the Coffee Gets Cold by Toshikazu Kawaguchi

Imagine a café where you can travel back in time, but only until your coffee turns cold.
I know it sounds whimsical, but it’s actually about regret, missed conversations, and the ache of “if only.” Each character’s choice feels deeply human, the way we replay moments in our head, wishing we’d said something different, or hugged someone longer.

The Midnight Library by Matt Haig

If every regret led to a parallel life, would you actually be happier? This one’s about second chances, and realizing that “perfect” doesn’t exist. It’s comforting, especially if you’ve ever felt stuck in your own what-ifs.

What books have made you think about thinking? Or read anything similar? I’d love some recommendations!

1oewczk,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1oewczk/rf_connections_chapter_1_josh/,[RF] Connections - Chapter 1: JOSH,"There is a café on the corner of a quiet street in a busy city. It is painted pale green. Two wooden benches sit outside its windows – old, uneven, sturdiness long gone.  

A sign hangs above the door with one of those trendy names written in cursive. Step inside and you are met with the scent of freshly brewing coffee and floors that creak under every step. Small tables are scattered about. Each covered with a different tablecloth – all trying too hard to be quirky and not quite succeeding.

On the walls hang pictures of artfully decorated cups of coffee, milk clouds shaped into hearts, bears and cartoon characters, ready for TikTok. There is a Labubu one. A Mickey Mouse one. In the corner, two Gen Z’ers laugh as they take photos of their coffee, proud of the big 7 in the foam because they are in *Group 7*.

Behind the counter, a tired-looking barista moves on autopilot, making yet another drink. His apron is splattered with glitter and syrup, the aftermath of twenty-two decorative coffees already served that morning. The café was once trendy and still tries to keep up with the latest fad, but the belief in the dream has faded. Even so, it endures, surviving on another swipeable trend.

And yet, others sit here too. A woman in the corner, smiling quietly at her book. An older couple sharing tea and conversation, still finding new stories after all these years.

Why, you might ask, are they in a place like this?  
The secret: **bad WiFi**.

For all its efforts to stay connected to the world, the café never managed to make its connection work. And so, the people who come here connect instead with themselves, with each other, with their books, their music. *They connect*.

One of them is Josh.

Every morning, around 8:27, Josh arrives before work. He orders a black Americano, the plainest thing on the menu. Because that is exactly what Josh is: Plain. Standard. 

He was born on time, healthy, to two loving parents who worked hard, never complained, and always showed up, soccer practice, school plays, everything. He grew up in a medium-sized town with a medium-sized circle of friends, studied just enough to get good grades. His life was, in every possible way, average.

And he felt guilty about that. Guilty for not having a tragedy to overcome. For not carrying a story worth telling. For being fine.

When he was fourteen, his parents moved to a slightly bigger town, and he thought, *this is it*. *My moment.* A new school, new people. Surely *something* will happen. Something that will define me.  
But it did not. He made friends easily. The bomb never dropped. The average-ness continued.

He studied business administration, not out of passion, but because it meant he could move away. Maybe *that* would become his thing.

He met his wife at twenty-four, at a college party. They fell in love, married three years later, and now have two children, a boy and a girl. His wife works from 9 to 5 as a customer service rep. Her job gives her time to make dinner, bathe the kids, not because Josh expects it (God, no), but because she wants to.  
Sometimes, he wishes she would protest, slam a door, shout. Just once. So that could be *his* story. But she does not. She loves him. And he loves her.

Still, he feels he is missing something…some part of the world that is dangerous and dark. The lows that change a person. The monsters that need conquering, the princesses that need saving. He longs for dark nights getting lost in the woods, to come out at the other end a hero, scarred, but proud of the fight he had to win.

He sips his Americano and looks around the café, contemplating the lives of others, their worries, fears, heartaches and battles won. He longs for a fight, too, so he can have a story to tell. To come out changed. Stronger. Fuller.

He steps out of the café and his phone starts to ring. Looking down, he does not see the woman on the bike until she shouts, “Watch out!” A second later, she crashes into him. He tumbles to the ground, the Americano splashing across his grey suit trousers.

The woman jumps up and apologizes fiercely, trying to wipe the coffee from his trousers with her well-worn scarf. He looks up into her face, two big blue eyes, long blonde hair in a messy top bun. She is wearing a long parka and gloves with no fingers. *Huh*, he thinks, *who even wears gloves with no fingers? What’s the point? Your fingers still get cold. And they look ugly as hell… why?*

She asks, “Are you okay?“  
He startles, he had been staring too long at her hands, her slender fingers poking through the wool.

“Yeah, all good. Don’t worry about it,” he says.

“Let me at least buy you another coffee,” she insists.

He hesitates, already late for work. But there are no important meetings this morning. What is ten minutes more? He nods.

They step back into the café.  
“What’ll you have?” she asks.  
“Plain Americano,” he replies.  
She smirks. “Of course.” Then she orders: “One plain Americano and one caramel macchiato with almond milk and extra chocolate sprinkles.”

He looks at her, puzzled.  
She shrugs. “Always make from a bad situation a better one,” she says, and winks.

They sit down at a small table. She stretches out her hand.  
“I’m Anabel, without an *E* at the end,” she says, winking again.  
He stutters, “Josh. That’s me.”  
“Nice to meet you, Josh,” she says, smiling.

He looks at her while she smiles up at him. She has an energy about her, buzzing, bubbling over with pink sparks. Her worn bicycle outside and her mix of florals and prints hint at a life full of adventure. Of coming and going. Of places visited and left behind. Of people, libraries, books, and history. A life of excitement.

He sees it now, the path he could explore. To take her hand and step into a world of unknowns: book readings, rainy nights in tents on lonely mountains, apple martinis in hotel lounges with jazz humming in the background. Passionate love and even more passionate arguments. Highs and lows that would wipe away his averageness.

And then, faces appear in his mind, one, two, three of them. His wife, making lasagna at home. His kids, running around the garden, their laughter filling his heart. His “average” life, waiting for him and suddenly, he sees it as not average at all.

Love. Kindness. Freedom. Comfort. How could he ever put that at risk for a thrill? Coming home to his wife’s laugh, to his children’s hugs, *that* is the highest of highs. He may not have scars to show off, but what he has are *badges*, proudly covering his heart for all to see.

He looks at Anabel again and smiles.  
“Nice to meet you, Anabel, without an E. Thanks for the coffee, but I should get going. Need to finish work so I can get home to my wife and kids.”

She smiles up at him, understanding completely.  
“Have a great rest of your life, Josh,” she says, and winks one last time.

Josh steps out of the café feeling lighter, and fuller, at the same time. He looks up at the sky and smiles, saying a quiet prayer of thanks to whatever entity is out there for granting him this “averageness.”

He takes a deep breath and starts his walk to the metro station.  
*I wonder if it’s lasagna tonight… or pasta pesto?* he thinks.

1oewcpa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oewcpa,Tried to stay friends with my ex but he crossed the line. AIO?,"A few days ago I met up with my ex for coffee. I broke up with him a month ago and the breakup was amicable so we agreed we would stay friends. He seemed totally okay with that and said things like “I really appreciate your friendship”. This was the first time we meet up after the break up. Almost right after we sat down at the table he started stroking my leg from under the table, I kind of froze and didn’t say anything for a while. Until I finally spoke up and said he was crossing a boundary, at that point he did apologize and stop. I don’t feel like it was on me to tell him he needed to stop because I had already made it clear I wanted to just be friends. As our conversation went on it just got more weird he started talking about a date he was going on later that week and saying things like “I hope she’s similar to you” and I would respond with “maybe she’s more compatible with you than I was”. I wanted to take the attention off of me and switch the attention to other people we’re into. So I asked him who his celebrity crush is he responded with “when I was young it was Sofia Vergara” and I wish he stopped there but he continued with “now that I’m older I just find the average porn star to be more attractive” which I thought was a very odd thing to say and reflects how he views women. He also mentioned how he’s very lonely and looking for a gf. Later he said he was messaging women on Facebook and asking them for nudes. So I said “that’s not a great away to ask a girl to be your gf” and he followed with “no those girls are just for fun I’m looking for a girlfriend on dating apps” again strange thing to say. 

The reason I feel some empathy towards him is because I know he struggles with bipolar 1 and it makes him more impulsive and makes him speak his mind without putting a lot of thought into it. I really don’t think he’s a bad person. We just have different values and I prefer surrounding myself with people with similar values. So I certainly don’t want to be friends but I’m thinking maybe I should apologize for being a little harsh. Does he deserve an apology? ",0,1761308793.0,AIO,100,0.49,False

There are two things, and if you are either of these things I think we'll get along almost immediately (not gonna say immediately coz that's putting pressure on things). And yes being introverted it's definitely hard to talk to strangers and conversations are weird, but if I'm talking about something I'm passionate about(see below) the conversation will not stop. You'll see a different side of me. Okay here goes:

1. You are neurodivergent. I'm choked full of ADHD, so much so that I definitely stand out amongst the weird people. And I realised that most of the friends I like are neurodivergent. So if you are neurodivergent, come chat with me, we're gonna vibe so hard.

2. I'm going to list a bunch of game and TV media and activities that I am into, and if you're into at least 40% of things on this list or similar things then we have so much to talk about and bond over. Let's do this:
Owl house
Amphibia
(Basically any of the cool Disney/cartoon network shows, e.g. adventure time)
Hollow knight
Life is strange
Monster(anime)
Code Geass
Lord of the rings
Portal
Alan Wake
Dave the diver
Gris
Skyrim
Celeste
Magic the gathering
Board games
Climbing
Archery
Escape rooms
The witness
What remains of Edith Finch 

Bonus points for the more obscure stuff listed below:
Sable's grimoire
Rusty lake
Fran bow
In stars and time
Animal well
Nimona

Double all your points if you remember defiance the MMO shooter

The point system is a joke btw, coz 100 points to you if you read all that. As a reward, if you DM me with a message starting with ""potato"" you get exclusive pictures of my cat 😺😁.

Anyway, just to establish things now to avoid awkward chats that goes nowhere later, I think in order for me to bond with someone I do need to meet them or talk over call. So if you do message, expect that we will talk a bit about whatever, but I'd like to go to call over discord/other app and then if we chime we could go for a coffee together somewhere, or find an escape room to do and chat on a day out.",1,1761308744.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

Normal friendships that blends with my female friendships. We have group chats sending memes, ocassionally grab coffee or hang in group settings. 

But my boyfriend gets weirdly quiet whenever I mention them. When I ask if it bothers him, he says he trust me. But clearly something's up. 

I want to respect whatever he's feeling, but he won't actually tell me what that is. And I'm not cutting off friends based on a vibe. 

Genuinely asking men here, what do you guys need in this situation? Should I bring it up differently? Stop mentioning them? Or is this something he needs to work though himself?",0,1761308540.0,AskMenAdvice,237,0.46,False
1oew8mq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1oew8mq/analyzed_25000_nyc_restaurants_bars_and_cafes_as/,"Analyzed 25,000 NYC restaurants, bars and cafes as a side project - built an app to find the actually unique ones","Google Maps kept showing me chains. Instagram influencers posted the same 10 trendy spots. I wanted to find the actually unique places - the tiny wine bar in Chinatown, the family-run Georgian restaurant, the speakeasy you'd walk past without knowing.

So I built Nectar while working full-time in finance. Analyzed 25,000+ places across NYC and filtered down to those that are genuinely ""one of one"" - experiential, not generic. The map evolves as new spots open and the food scene changes, so it stays current without being algorithm-driven viral nonsense.

The app maps them with filtering by vibe, neighborhood, cuisine - basically the discovery tool I wished existed. No ads, no data selling, just good spots.

Built with Flutter/Django/Supabase. Took way longer than expected (don't they all?), but finally launched on the App Store this week.

Free to download: [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nectar-find-your-spot/id6753898421)

Would love feedback from fellow builders - especially on the onboarding and discoverability features.

I wish I had known this earlier.,"been dealing with bloating for over a year. tried everything - no gluten, no dairy, even low fodmap for a month. nothing worked.

3 weeks ago started adding fermented foods but did it differently this time:

week 1: just 1 tbsp of kefir daily (not a full cup)
week 2: added sauerkraut to lunch
week 3: kombucha with less than 5g sugar

results after about 2.5 weeks:
- bloating dropped like 80%
- don't need 3 coffees anymore
- sleeping better too??

the key was starting SMALL. first time i tried a full cup of kefir i was dying lol

also most store stuff is pasteurized = dead bacteria = waste of money

not saying this works for everyone, just sharing what helped me. happy to answer questions

While I've been generally pleased with the quality of the coffee (importantly both pour over and espresso) something happened yesterday that I've been waiting to happen. While my partner was brewing coffee she looked me in the eyes and said, ""I hate this grinder."" 

We need to find something that's a bit more of a joy to use with a bit less faff involved while using it. Her specific annoyances are, probably obviously, stalling. The other big issue is capacity.

I knew I was making compromises when I purchased this grinder, I'd save some money and it'd be a bit finicky. Well, the time has come to put up or shut up. Where do we go from here? Everytime I think about upgrading any piece of gear I realize how many new things there are that I don't know about. Should we just get the Lagom P64 I was initially listing over?? 

For background here's our grinder upgrade path: Baratza Encore > [bought a lever machine] > Kinu M47 > [tired of hand grinding larger batches] > Niche Zero > [wanted a little more out of our cups, specifically flat burrs] > DF64V. 

Out of all of them, the DF64V is her least favorite, though she did struggle with hand grinding.

1oew4zd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oew4zd,Bought and customised my Alter/Ego bag at Coach @ Cat Street in Tokyo (and got Coach coffee!),"I was really lucky to visit Japan earlier this month. I love to buy a new bag whenever I visit somewhere new as a momentum of the trip, and I was so excited to find our the Coach store in Harajuku was a Coach Play store! 

I had no idea what to expect and I'd been to many Coach stores and outlets before this but never a Play store. The store itself stood out on the street it was on and when I got inside it was 3 floors! 

The top floor was a coffee shop so even if I didn't buy anything, I knew I'd be getting coffee! I loved the C art on the foam and the cookie was delicious! No one was in there so it was a very relaxed and lovely break from the street outside. 

The coffee shop had some great looking merch such as t-shirts, baseball caps and keyrings, but I chose to go without as they were all £50+.

I then went downstairs to look at bags. I'd been eyeing up the Swing Zip and the Alter/Ego but ultimately went with the Alter/Ego as the leather was so soft and I love the slouchy design and bigger size. I couldn't find this colour on the UK site so that finalised my decision. The bag was 57,000¥ (£280) which is only slightly cheaper then the £295 it was listed back home, but Japan offers tourists the 10% tax back so overall I'm very happy with the saving! 

Finally, it being a Coach Play store, they offered real-time customisation! For 2,000¥ (£10) I had a cherry charm added to one of the patches on my Alter/Ego. But I tell you it was painful to watch them drill a hole in the bag just after I'd bought it 😅

Overall, as a Coach girl this was such a fun experience! If you find yourself in Tokyo I'd definitely recommend popping in for a coffee. The staff were so lovely and welcoming, and there was also a stamp hunt throughout the store, and if you collect all 5 stamps you get to have a go on the Coach capsule toy machine. I won a free set of Coach stickers! ",108,1761308174.0,handbags,6,1.0,False
