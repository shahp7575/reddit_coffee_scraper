For example, I had 3 coffees with milk and a little maple syrup,another coffee with hot chocolate (very little sugar) a small bowl of lettuce with cheese and homemade salad dressing, like a bite of chicken, a bowl of yogurt slightly sweetened with more maple syrup and a bowl of cream of broccoli soup with a homemade biscuit. I'm hungry now before bed, but am deciding to forgo and go to bed.

I'm hoping that removing this snack daily will help me to lose weight. Anyone else had experience with this? I am not counting calories because I cannot keep up. I've done it before, but with my life the way it is right now cannot. But removing the snack might help? Seeing if anyone else has done this and if it worked for them.

How to heal and let go?","Throughout our relationship, my ex exhibited extreme insecurity, often accusing me of entertaining other people without reason. 

One night, while he was out playing soccer, I studied at a kava lounge for an upcoming grad school quiz. When i returned home, he accused me of cheating. I offered to take him to the lounge to verify my whereabouts to ease his concerns, but he refused. 

The argument escalated, leading him to throw my packed belongings outside his apartment and then threatened to k himself if I left. We broke up and then I called a friend and asked her to pick me up from his apartment. 

We reconciled that same weekend under the condition that he seek therapy for his insecurities and emotional instability. 

HERE‚ÄôS THE KICKER!!!! I later discovered that during our brief breakup (48hours), he met with his previous ex for ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù, and had saved her contact under a different name in his phone so I wouldn‚Äôt find out. 

This breach of trust led me to end the relationship for good. 

Despite multiple attempts to contact me, (which I declined!!) he resorted to calling me childish and an attention-seeker for rejecting him before telling me he missed me and loved me with his whole heart. Upon no response from me he proceeded to block me. 

Why did he block me?

Why does this still hurt when I know I made the right choice?

How can I stop thinking about him and his ex getting back together?

I've installed the latest version of Logitech Gaming Software on the laptop and transferred my profiles. Yet none of the (G) macro keys work. The macros are very simple, just keystrokes, nothing more complicated than Crtl + 8.

On my PC, it all works perfectly. I have duplicated the settings exactly. The keyboard funtions normally when plugged in to the Laptop, including the media and volume keys. It's just the G1-G18 macro keys that won't work.

The mouse works fine because I don't have anything wildly different to ""normal"" mouse buttons, BUT the button I have programmed in LGS to ""Show Desktop"" does not work.

PC and Laptop are both on Windows 11 Home and are up-to-date. Laptop is a Microsoft Surface 7.  
I'm using LGS because GHub doesn't support the G510 and is not an option.

Things I have already tried: Restarts, Uninstall/Reinstall, an earlier version of LGS, the 32-bit version of LGS, Deleting/Reinstalling drivers for both devices. I've tried not using the Profile import in LGS and just written a whole new profile from scratch on a fresh install on the laptop.

Things I haven't tried: Pouring coffee in it, setting fire to it, breaking it up into little pieces and jumping on them. But I will soon.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/sP08xtJ2mm)  **Feb 19, 2023** 

I (26f) just found out I‚Äôm pregnant after having revenge sex with the fianc√© (35m) of the girl (30f) who my ex boyfriend(32m) cheated on me with for 2 years. 

My ex and I met when I was 20 but were only friends until we started dating 2 1/2 years ago. I found out last year that my ex had been cheating on me for basically our whole relationship with a girl he met through a mutual friend. I broke things off after I found out and told the girl‚Äôs fianc√© about their affair, he ended up breaking off their engagement after he found out and she seemed nonchalant about it until she realized that my ex‚Äôs money wasn‚Äôt actually his (my grandma left me a lot after she passed back in 2019 and my ex had been flaunting around the things I‚Äôd gifted him throughout our relationship to her, even going as far as to claim that the house and antique car my grandpa left for me in his will were my ex‚Äôs). 

It‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm proud of now that I think back to it, but I did allow my ex to walk all over me for the first month or two after I broke things off because I missed him so much, I gave him money and tried to make things work but would always get reprimanded by my parents and friends when I‚Äôd run to them crying after he ghosted me for her, I didn‚Äôt officially give him up until the girl‚Äôs ex fianc√© messaged me and told me that she was rubbing it in some of their old friends‚Äô faces about how pathetic I was and how desperate I was for my ex who didn‚Äôt even give an f about me. I was really upset and asked him if he‚Äôd be willing to meet up with me because I knew that if I talked to my parents or friends about this, then they‚Äôd just lecture me even more. He agreed and the two of us met up at a random food cart place, we ended up spending most of the day just exploring and talking about how we were doing. 

He‚Äôd also confided in me about his relationship with his ex, they‚Äôd known each other for 10 years and they‚Äôd liked each other for most of the time they were friends but he wasn‚Äôt looking for a relationship because he was focusing on school. He had decided to give them a chance after she‚Äôd driven 12+hrs overnight to him because they‚Äôd talked on the phone and he said he was feeling under the weather and was stressed from how vigorous his residency schedule was. She‚Äôd dropped everything to take care of him, help clean his place, and made him some home cooked meals after finding out that he was surviving off of vending machine snacks and instant coffee. He told me in detail about how he‚Äôd never felt so loved and cared for, how after she‚Äôd done that for him, he‚Äôd decided that she was the one; that if this wasn‚Äôt love, then love wasn‚Äôt real. Finding out that she was cheating for the last two years made everything click into place, she‚Äôd been pushing off getting married, telling all her friends that she was having doubts about him. He‚Äôd been trying to convince her into going to couple‚Äôs counseling when I broke the news to him that she was sleeping with my ex. 

I felt like a monster, hearing their love story and then realizing that they didn‚Äôt get their happy ending because of my ex and I messed with my head. We continued to talk from time to time, checking in on each other and meeting up for quick bite every now and then, we lost contact after the girl my ex cheated on me with somehow convinced him to take her back. I became slightly depressed after he cut me off, explaining to me that he was still in love with her and wanted to work things out, which meant a clean slate. 

I found out through some internet snooping that my ex cheated on her too, which was why she went back to her ex fianc√©. A few months passed and things went back to semi-normal, I started getting therapy and was about ready to put myself back out there to try out the dating pool again when around new years I got a call from the guy, he was crying and asking if I was available to talk, I of course said yes and out of concern met up with him at his place. He broke down to me and told me about how he‚Äôd found her and my ex in his mom‚Äôs guest bedroom during Christmas when she‚Äôd snuck him in for a quickie during his family‚Äôs busy holiday party, all hell broke loose when he‚Äôd found them in the guest bedroom after spending 20mins looking for her everywhere. We drank a bit and ended up having sex, he apologized and told me that it was a mistake and he wasn‚Äôt in his right mind, that he just wanted revenge sex but it didn‚Äôt make him feel any better after. I tried to message him platonically a few times after to see if he was alright but he blocked me, so I dropped it and went on with my therapy and life. I went in last week to check with my doctor since I‚Äôd been getting bad cramps and to get a new prescription refill for my birth control that I use to help with my PCOS, I had to do a usual test to double check for the possibility if I was pregnant and was very surprised when it came back positive. 

I have been sitting on this new knowledge and have been contemplating on if I should tell him, not tell him, or if I should even keep the pregnancy. My doctor did inform that since I am still in the earlier stages I am still at a big risk of having a miscarriage, so I don‚Äôt know if I should even be worrying at all about all of this since there is a chance that I could lose it, and then it‚Äôd just seem like I was trying to grab at his attention or something, especially after he‚Äôd made it clear to me that he wasn‚Äôt comfortable talking to me anymore after we slept together. I haven‚Äôt told anyone and have been going crazy because I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/Kx7Z3JLUYm)  **May 20, 2024** 

*Update*
I‚Äôm not sure how Reddit works, but I will simply make a new post. 

A lot has happened since my original post. 

I know a lot of people were against this, but I went through with the pregnancy and I am forever thankful for my beautiful baby. I had originally planned to get an abortion, but I found myself unable to go through with the appointment. (I am pro-choice and always will be. Just because I chose to keep my baby doesn‚Äôt mean another woman/girl should be forced to keep a pregnancy they do not wish to continue. Everyone has a right to their own bodies.) My parents were very upset with me and my whole family disowned me. I listened to what some of you said about letting the father know (will be referring to him as ‚ÄòDave‚Äô), after many failed attempts to reach out to him I decided to go in person. Dave was not happy when I showed up at his place but when I told him why, he agreed to talk with me. Dave let me know that he‚Äôd officially ended things with his ex and wanted to go no contact with me because I was another tie to his past with her, but he was willing to try and figure out a co-parenting plan with me if I agreed to a paternity test first. I of course felt a bit bad about the paternity test part but agreed to it since we both had only been acquaintances that bonded over our trauma. Everything was honestly easy cruising until I started to spot around the 26 week mark, my OBGYN explained that while spotting is normal while pregnant, mine was heavier and my blood sugar/blood pressure also both worried them because of gestational diabetes and preeclampsia risk. 

After a few nights of Dave insisting on sleeping on my couch, I had him help me move some of my things to his place since he lived closer to the hospital. I am very thankful I decided to semi-move in with him when I did bc I went into premature labor at 32 weeks. I am very thankful to have had Dave and his family as my support system; his mom would come and switch out with him at the hospital and advocated for me whenever I felt washed out or unheard, she helped me both emotionally and physically and stood by me. Dave‚Äôs mom also helped me work through my emotions when all I wanted was my mom (she and my dad had gone no contact with me after I decided to keep and have my baby). Dave‚Äôs mom was an absolute godsend also because she‚Äôs a retired nurse (she started in OB, went to NICU and eventually later settled into lactation before retiring) and explained things to me when we found out that my baby had respiratory problems and had SUA (single umbilical artery) and that it could‚Äôve been a factor into why I went into premature labor. She stayed with Dave and I so she could help me with pumping since I wasn‚Äôt able to produce milk and encouraged me when I felt like such a failure for not being able to take care of my son when he needed me most, she drove me to and from the hospital while my son was in the NICU because I was healing and so mentally/physically exhausted. I really and truly believe that I didn‚Äôt fall into deep postpartum depression because she held me and helped me with each step and was always so patient with me, even when I wasn‚Äôt with myself. Dave‚Äôs mom would constantly remind me that nothing was our fault and no one did anything wrong, it just that everyone is faced with hardships in life and this was one we‚Äôd work together to get through. 

My son graduated from the NICU and came home a month after I did, Dave‚Äôs mom visited us often and helped with him since Dave and I are first time parents. Dave‚Äôs dad joked that he felt like she and I had the baby together and he and Dave were both just background characters that make guest star appearances every now and then since Dave was working so much in order to build more PTO and his mom wouldn‚Äôt bring his dad along when she‚Äôd come visit since she didn‚Äôt want him to disturb me and the baby with his loudness (Dave‚Äôs dad is hard of hearing and can sometimes be unaware of his volume so he took no offense to it). 

Dave‚Äôs siblings and family members posted a lot about our son because he was the first grandchild and first baby in a long time, Dave‚Äôs youngest cousin is 17 (turning 18 this year). Somehow someone must‚Äôve shared a photo or something, but pictures of us reached my family and my parents demanded I let them meet my son. Dave was supportive of whatever I chose to do and said he‚Äôd agree to them meeting him if that‚Äôs what I wanted. After thinking about it for a few days I decided that I wanted to talk to my parents before I let them meet my son; when we met up to talk, my parents were offended that I didn‚Äôt bring my son with us and left him with Dave‚Äôs parents, they said some really hurtful things and then my dad started to question on when Dave was going to ask him for permission for us to get married since we didn‚Äôt already have a shotgun wedding while I was pregnant. I was okay with them insulting me since I‚Äôd grown up with it and was used to it, but once my parents put their target on Dave and his family I became upset and decided it was time for us to leave. 

My parents did try to petition for legal visitation rights (honestly, before this whole ordeal, I did not even know that grandparents rights existed), but were denied because my son is still very young and because both Dave and I are very much on good terms, are living in the same household, and they couldn‚Äôt find or prove that there was any danger to our son‚Äôs wellbeing. My family did try to reach out to us and claim that we were horrible people for denying my parents their grandchild, but no one ever seemed to be able to make a peep when Dave‚Äôs family would defend us and point out that my family had been the one to disown me and that no one cared to see if I was okay until after I had the baby and everything was handled. Dave‚Äôs mom and my mom got in a verbal (almost physical) altercation after my mom had made false reports to cps and called the police to do multiple welfare checks on us, my mom was given a warning by the police for harassing us after one specific incident where she threw a tantrum and caused a scene when the police found nothing wrong in the welfare check and refused to listen to her demands to have my son temporarily taken away from us and put in her custody ‚Äòfor his safety‚Äô. Dave and I currently have restraining orders pending against my parents and certain family members. 

One of the reasons I decided to update is because about two months ago a friend of Dave‚Äôs asked him out to have some drinks and they ran into his ex-fiance who later messaged him to tell him that she regretted the way they ended and how she was very hurt when she heard that we had a baby together, especially with it being so soon after their relationship. Dave wouldn‚Äôt talk to me about how he felt, and when I asked him he just brushed me off or switched the conversation onto a topic about our son that he knew would distract me. I noticed Dave pulling away from me and how our relationship became a bit awkward and strained after their run in and her message because I know he still has feelings for her and I am afraid that he might feel trapped with me and our son. I also noticed that the drama with my family has made Dave and his family less patient with me and my son, during Mother‚Äôs Day I overheard a few of his family members make comments to Dave about me being at their family barbecue since ‚ÄòI was just my son‚Äôs mom‚Äô and ‚Äònot really‚Äô part of the family, Dave just shrugged and said I didn‚Äôt have anyone else to spend the day with. 

With how tense things have been, I have been thinking about moving out and back into my place. I stayed with Dave at his place after I gave birth, but now that our son is slightly older and I am healed, I want to give Dave back some space so that he can start dating again if he wants to and to give him back some more ‚Äòbachelor‚Äô time when I have our son. I want to find a way to approach me moving out and us making a coparenting plan without making making things more awkward or possibly ruining the relationship I have with Dave and his parents, I don‚Äôt want them to feel like I‚Äôm not grateful or anything, but I do want to go back to work and get my life back on track so that I can provide my portion of needs for my son and not want to depend on his family for more than appropriate. 

[Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking things](https://www.reddit.com/u/Living_Temporary5351/s/bVuxsRgz5J)  **May 24, 2024**


I‚Äôve been trying my best to not check my phone or Reddit since I‚Äôm honestly a little overwhelmed right now. I will let you all know that I did talk to Dave and he was against me moving out, he also wasn‚Äôt willing to talk about the situation what how he‚Äôs been acting after running into his ex and said I was bringing up something that didn‚Äôt matter since we were talking about me wanting to move out. I haven‚Äôt said anything about what I heard during Mother‚Äôs Day and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to mention it since I feel really bad that it was meant to be a private conversation so I don‚Äôt think anyone meant anything bad. During our conversation Dave let me know that maybe I‚Äôm just overthinking or overreacting and that I shouldn‚Äôt make big decisions like moving out, he also talked about how because our son is a preemie he‚Äôd prefer if one of us was a stay at home parent until he turned 2-3yrs old so he could catch up with his peers and then once he started pre-k then we could go back to work again. But I feel like he‚Äôs been trying to avoid me since the conversation but I could also me overthinking like he said‚Ä¶but after reading someone comments I do feel like I‚Äôm valid in the way I feel but I am also not sure anymore, I want to do what‚Äôs best for my son. I know people already think I‚Äôm so dumb and that I shouldn‚Äôt have had him, but I am trying to be better for my son, I feel like he‚Äôs my only family left and I really want to try to do what‚Äôs best for him. 

##**NEW UPDATE**

[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/u/Living_Temporary5351/s/IFxNSY1n2p)  **Feb 17, 2025 (9 months after last update/2 years after OG Post)**

I don‚Äôt think anyone really cares for this update, but I‚Äôm going to put it here for anyone who may want to know. 

After the last time I posted, things were a bit awkward and tense between Dave and I for a few weeks until Father‚Äôs Day. I honestly didn‚Äôt feel comfortable going to his aunt‚Äôs house for their family gathering because of the conversation I‚Äôd overheard during Mother‚Äôs Day but I went because it was Dave‚Äôs first Father‚Äôs Day after we‚Äôd had our son the previous year. I initially didn‚Äôt want to bring up the topic because it was supposed to be a good day, but Dave was actually the one who brought up the topic after we‚Äôd returned from his aunt‚Äôs house. 

Dave confessed about the Mother‚Äôs Day conversation with his cousins and said they‚Äôd grilled him during Father‚Äôs Day as well because he‚Äôd brought me with him to their aunt‚Äôs house. Dave apologized for making me worry and for not standing up for me when his family said things about me behind my back, but told me that he honestly didn‚Äôt want me to move out and for us to split our son‚Äôs custody, especially because it was comforting to know that he was going to be coming home to the both of us after spending a long day at work. I told him I didn‚Äôt want to ruin the day and we could talk about things the next day but Dave was adamant on us clearing the air because he was tired of how uncomfortable things were between us.

Ironically, Dave told me he was afraid of me feeling trapped with him, especially after seeing how traumatizing it was for me to go into premature labor, deal with our son in the NICU/being separated from him, and me healing postpartum. Dave also said he felt worse about everything after seeing how my family treated me and then how some members of his own family held it against me. He told me that although he himself didn‚Äôt mean to do this in anyway, he felt like I was trapped and isolated with only him for me to depend on. He made sure to make it crystal clear that while he would want for us to try and work towards a relationship to see where things go, he also doesn‚Äôt want me to feel pressured or that I have to stay with him if I am not happy/don‚Äôt want to, he agreed that he would rather us be on good terms for our son‚Äôs sake and if that means us having a friendship-like relationship with mutual respect for one another, then he is okay with it as well. 

We talked for a while about everything and cleared the air of any questions. Dave let me know that he genuinely didn‚Äôt feel anything for his ex-fianc√© and that the reason for him becoming distant had nothing to do with me and was because he‚Äôd had a life crisis when he thought about how different his life was compared to how he‚Äôd wanted and thought it would be like. Dave and I came to an understanding that my son and I would continue to stay with Dave and I would get a part time job to slowly ease my way back into working. 

Things were rocky and a little odd to navigate at first, but Dave‚Äôs parents helped us a lot with our son when I started job hunting and got a part time position working at a local bank branch nearby Dave‚Äôs place. Dave and I slowly started to explore our relationship to see where things would go between us, it was weird for the both of us because of how we‚Äôd met and started out, but within 3-4months things got much better. I moved my things from our son‚Äôs room into Dave‚Äôs, our son had a hard time initially when Dave and I began to show more affection (hugging and quick innocent kisses) with one another because he had a bit of jealousy at how close we were since he was used to us only showering our affections onto him and not each other, but he‚Äôs gotten used to it now. 

Dave‚Äôs family has said in a playful joking manner that we should give our son a sibling to play and grow up with since no one else from Dave‚Äôs family has kids, but I try to avoid the conversation of when we‚Äôll have more kids. I took some of your advice and I joined mommy and me groups so my son does have some playmates his age, but I do sometimes find myself feeling guilty for how lonely he may be when it‚Äôs just him and us at home. This past valentines, while in the heat of the moment, Dave did make a few comments about wanting to get me pregnant again, but when I mentioned and clarified with him afterwards he said it was just him being really into ‚Äòit‚Äô at the moment. 

Dave and I have previously had a conversation and agreed that because of my PCOS and how unbalanced my hormones are, I wouldn‚Äôt go back onto birth control because of how I‚Äôve been feeling much better after the birth of our son so we are using the calendar method as contraceptive for my end, but I have tried asking Dave if he‚Äôd be willing to use condoms and he‚Äôs made it clear that he doesn‚Äôt like them and it‚Äôs completely off the table for him because he doesn‚Äôt like the feeling of being constricted in latex. I know he‚Äôs clean and so am I, but we‚Äôve had two previous pregnancy scares. There are times when Dave forgets to pull out but he‚Äôs assured me that if we get pregnant again then it wouldn‚Äôt change anything except that we‚Äôd have another baby and I might have to quit my job and stay home again, but I know I‚Äôm not ready for that yet. Our son is only just turning two later this year and it‚Äôs already so hard juggling just one child with our schedules and jobs, I don‚Äôt know how we‚Äôd manage with two kids. Dave and I are in a wonderful place right now in our life and relationship so I don‚Äôt want to keep bringing up contraceptives or anything because I don‚Äôt want to ruin the peace, I‚Äôve been contemplating possibly going back onto the pill or looking into other options I could use but I‚Äôm scared to put my body through a whirlwind of hormones and put a toll on my mental health again. If anyone has any suggestions please let me know, thank you all so much for your support and kind words, my life has truly changed for the better and I am forever grateful and thankful to everyone of you for your words of advice and wisdom!

**RECAP**

[Original Post - rareddit](https://rareddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1brgoeq/deleted_by_user/?share_id=iLUV4UR0LaUkqAopOUdib): **March 31, 2024**

To give the background, OOP and his wife have a great relationship. OOP arrange a date night ever month for both himself and his wife such as dinner somewhere and grab drinks afterwards, sometimes with friends. He makes sure there is a babysitter for their children, and they are being fed. This month, OOP has an evening planned, a fantastic dinner, and a nearly wine bar for drinks after. OOP's wife had been texting with the other couple to meet up for drinks. The husband joined OOP and his wife at a local bar after taking his wife home. When it was getting late, it was time for OOP and his wife to get home to their kids, she didn't want the evening to end so the three ended up at OOP's house for another drink. 

OOP was ready to call it a night after staying up late with his wife and their friend. His wife didn't want the night to end so she asked for 10 more minutes. It wasn't until 3:00AM when the wife finally came into the bedroom, and she was drunk. OOP is now wide awake and asked her if she wants to have sex. She declined and wanted to go sleep which was fair for OOP. He felt frustrated and abandoned because she spent her drinking time with someone else and broke her promise about going to bed at a reasonable time with OOP. He mentioned it was the fourth date when the date night ended with having no sex at all. When OOP said that, it upset his wife. He asked if he was the AITA. 
 
OOP then answers questions for redditors. He gave a small update in the original post, where he apologized to his wife for getting in a fight, but made up and decided on how to have their date nights, just two of them and other nights with the other couple. 

**Editor's note: The original link of OOP's responses is preserved in rareddit. If you are on mobile, rareddit can have issues with that. You can click on the first BoRU linked at the top of this post, the full post for the original is in there**

[Update #1](https://undelete.pullpush.io/r/AITAH/comments/1cdqema/update_aita_for_expecting_sex_on_a_date_night/?share_id=yVjKTNCX4LWYDD8HxVU19): **April 26, 2024 (almost one month later)**

It has been almost a month since OOP posted about the date night he had with his wife which resulted with her hanging out with their friend, the husband, until 3AM. OOP informed Reddit that they were right to suspect something between his wife and their male friend. OOP was unpacking the car where his wife left her phone in there. A text message popped up from their friend, telling her how he wanted to kiss her and wanted to have a night out with her. OOP also discovered more text messages between his wife and the husband. They had been going on dates during the days when OOP was working. OOP confronted his wife who said that it was an emotional affair. She told OOP she still loved him, but she enjoyed the attention.  
 
&nbsp;

[Update #2](https://undelete.pullpush.io/r/AITAH/comments/1cgu9rh/deleted_by_user/): **April 30, 2024 (four days later)**

Four days later after the last update, OOP shared he had conversations with his wife about the emotional affair with Rick (the husband of the other couple mentioned / OOP's former friend). OOP's wife has apologized, and it turned out that the timeline of events was not bad as OOP originally thought. OOP gives the backstory on Rick and his wife. They had been dealing with marital issues for a while which OOP and his wife were aware of. Few months prior to the date night (in the original post), things were getting bad, and Rick started to talk with OOP's wife as if she was his therapist. It started once every week before it got to several times a week.  

OOP and his wife went on a ski trip with five other families including Rick and his wife. The trip was bad for Rick because he had been fighting with his wife. He got drunk and wanted to talk with OOP's wife as the therapist. Rick expressed his feelings for OOP's wife. She told him to back off and realized she should have told OOP, but she didn't want to mess up the trip for the whole friend group. After the trip, Rick's marriage took a turn for the worse and it showed the divorce was taking place. At the same time, OOP was working 60 hours every week due to a new division at his company. With the issues going on, Rick and OOP's wife were feeling isolated. Rick started to call OOP's wife every day and drinking heavily. OOP asked why his wife didn't tell him, she didn't want him to blow up the friend group and she was enjoying attention she received. OOP decided to do couple therapy with his wife and for her, she wants to do individual therapy to deal with her own issues. He hopes to update in a few months. 

&nbsp;

[Update #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/9FJR4Vdro6): **August 15, 2024 (almost four months later)**

OOP shares an update for the last few months. He was happy to report he and his wife are in a good place and set the boundaries on Rick. Going no contact was the plan, but Rick decided to call OOP's wife, begging to talk with her because he was making threats on himself. Rick was still drinking heavily, and wanted OOP's wife to leave him, wanting to tell everyone about the emotional affair. Rick started to have an obsession with OOP's SIL / wife's sister, having drinks together and talking daily. He is still married, but the divorce seems to be imminent. When OOP found out about the affair a few months early, he managed to work through the issues with his wife, including improve their communication. 

&nbsp;

**Editor's note: Update #4 is where we left off from the prior BoRU**

[Update #4](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/VCCedmJ27q): **August 21, 2024**

This is part 5 of the ongoing circus that is my personal life. In my last post, a lot of you expressed concern, surprise, or anger that my SIL was now meeting up with Rick. Those are all probably valid reactions to this news.

Yesterday, I decided that we should figure out what is going on between the two of them, and my wife and I reached out to SIL. I'm glad we did, because things just keep getting weirder and weirder. Rick and SIL have met up 5 or 6 times, either for coffee or drinks. The most recent (and likely final) meet-up was actually at Rick's house one evening - his wife and daughter were out of town visiting family (Rick had to work and couldn't go) and he had the place to himself, so he invited SIL over for a drink.

While hanging out, he told SIL that he believes he was married both to my wife and to SIL in prior lives, and that he is glad to have been reunited with them. He then told SIL that she was beautiful and put his hand on the side of her face (as one might do to one's partner - in my view it is a fairly intimate act).

This perhaps unsurprisingly freaked SIL out. To give her credit, she told Rick that he was being highly inappropriate, that he needed to stop, and that he couldn't keep taking someone trying to be a friend to him as showing interest in him. She then scolded him for doing this first to my wife and then to her. It's the sort of thing I wish my wife had told him when he started being inappropriate with her. From what I understand, she then left.

She has been ghosting him since then. Rick has apparently frantically texted her dozens and dozens of times.

SIL emphasized to us that she had no romantic interest in Rick and was just trying to be a friend to him.

It's all just odd to me. I've known Rick for years and I feel like the current Rick is a stranger. It makes me wonder if I ever actually knew the real Rick - I guess not.

#----NEW UPDATES----

[Update #5](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/uEbxZxB4gS): **October 8, 2024 (2.5 months later)**

TLDR Recap of Prior Posts: Wife had an emotional affair with my ex best friend (‚ÄúRick‚Äù), I overlooked the signs for too long because I trusted them, I eventually discovered the affair and shut things down, and my wife has been a model wife and partner since then and ceased all contact with Rick, other than several incidents detailed in my prior posts.

For the last few months, it seemed like this saga was finally behind me. But that is not how life works, and the phantom of Rick reared its head yet again. I opened my laptop and noticed that my wife had left her email account logged in. It was probably an invasion of privacy, but we had agreed that either of us could always look at the other‚Äôs phones, email, etc. so I snooped and searched to see if Rick had ever emailed her. There were a few innocent emails and one that sent me into a rage.

The email was from Rick to my wife‚Äôs work email and was truly unhinged ‚Äì it was pages and pages of Rick professing his undying love to my wife. In the email, Rick went on and on about how my wife cutting contact with him has broken him, how she is his soulmate and the only woman he has ever truly loved, and how he has tried for months to show her that he is the man for her and that he would be a better spouse than me (with a comment about how I don‚Äôt treat her like she deserves) and that he wants to help her raise our kids and his kid together. He adds that she is the first person he thinks about when he wakes up and the last person he thinks about when he goes to sleep, that he cries every day thinking of her and knowing that she slipped away, and that his last thought in life when he passes away will be of her.

He then lists his favorite memories with her, such as the time they went on a lunch date together, hugging her so he can smell her, playing guitar for her, her smile, singing songs together, and the time they sat together and watched shooting stars (we did a family trip together but I had to fly out a day later than everyone else due to work and apparently the first night the two of them stayed up and watched shooting stars after everyone else went to bed).

He then begs her to reconsider because he doesn‚Äôt want her to wake up one day 10 years from now and realize that she made a mistake staying with me, and that he is willing to wait until the day he dies to be with her because he will never stop loving her. He further adds he feels hurt that she seemingly enjoyed his attention but never had any intention of being with him.

As I noted above, finding this sent me into a rage, as I felt that my wife betrayed me by not telling me that Rick sent this. I am still a little hurt that she didn‚Äôt disclose it, but her perspective was that she had gone non-contact with him, he sent an email to try to get around being blocked on the phone, and that it was clearly unhinged so she just ignored it (which is true ‚Äì she never replied). She knew that I would be upset if I saw it, and that she and I are doing much better and she didn‚Äôt want to allow Rick to ruin things by being a jackass, especially when she has been doing right by me. I disagree with her logic and continue to believe that she should have immediately told me (and she understands that now and will do so if anything like this happens again), but I am not mad at her for it.

The peculiar thing is that discovering the email has massively improved my mental state and happiness. First, I now know with a high degree of confidence that nothing physical ever happened. My wife had already convinced me that this was the case, but this confirmed it. Rick would have at least tangentially mentioned it in his list of favorite memories if anything had occurred.

Second, the email confirmed that my wife had truly gone non-contact with him. A large portion of the email was about how being completely cut off from her was ruining him. Again, my wife had already convinced me that this was the case, but it is always nice to have external confirmation.

Third, it confirmed that while my wife acted inappropriately, she never really gave in to him ‚Äì the email was in large part a story of unrequited love. Rick was upset in the email that he showered her with praise and attention but never really got anything out of it.

And finally, the email is the ramblings of a sad little man. As much as I personally suffered post-discovery of the affair, Rick has suffered to a much higher degree. He‚Äôs ‚Ä¶. not doing well, and this email showed the depths of his despair. Perhaps it is bad to admit, but I‚Äôve been experiencing significant schadenfreude knowing that Rick has been suffering ‚Äì he deserves it.

I‚Äôm furious at Rick. We had reached a d√©tente a while back and I‚Äôve been civil with him the last few times I‚Äôve seen him. At one point I had straight up asked him to his face what his motives had been and what he had been trying to accomplish with respect to his relationship with my wife. He had the nerve to tell me that he had no real plan or goal and was just sad and depressed and looking for a friend and admitted he had made a few drunk mistakes and wished he could take them back. The scumbag lied to my face ‚Äì the email confirmed that he was trying to convince my wife to leave me, even after the affair had ended. I‚Äôm inevitably going to run into him again before too long, and I don‚Äôt know how I am going to react, but probably not well. I really want to punch him, but I know that is probably not a mature choice, even if he deserves to have the crap beaten out of him.

My wife had an interesting perspective, which was that the most soul crushing way to get my revenge would be to grab her and kiss her right in front of him the next time we run into him, as it would flaunt that I have what he desired more than anything but could never have. And the more I have thought about it, the more I know she is right. Petty? Sure, but I could use some vengeance right now.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter:** I love the idea of a kiss.

Rick is stalking your wife. Not good at all. She handled it well. She probably didn't tell you because she feared an escalation, physical violence etc.

The only AH in this is your ex friend

Your wife is a victim. Not a perpetrator.

You're stuck in the middle.

As it's her idea for the kids, go for it. She wouldn't have suggested it if she didn't want AH to receive a clear message from both of you. As a strong unit.

> **OOP:** Yeah the weirder this has gotten has really shown me that my wife was a victim in all of this too. She has some guilt, to be sure, but I have a ton of sympathy seeing how everything played out and how much of a bad actor he is. And she's even more sick of his shit than I am - she views him as an emotional terrorist.

**Commenter 2:** Have you outed your ex-friend to your shared friends group? If not, it would not be a bad idea. If he is trying to hook up with your wife, he may also be trying it with other wives/GF's in the group. Likely the others in a shared group would not want a cheater around who has been trying, or likely to try, luring away another friend's wife/GF.

> **OOP:** No. Our concern is that outing him blows up the friend group, and my wife and I will probably be blamed (at least partially) for not telling people sooner. I think there is a strong chance Rick divorces his wife and exits the group naturally, which solves the problem for us.

**Isn't Rick divorced already from his wife?**

> **OOP:** I think there is a decent chance either one pulls the plug. She has made comments to my wife in the past that she might want to exit, and Rick has made comments to both me and my wife that he probably will. But they do have a kid together and that always makes things complicated. I think if no kid they'd be long split.

**Trigger Warnings:** >!sexual assault, invasion of privacy, obsessive behavior!<

[Update #6](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/QfQrs8fwgV): **March 28, 2025**

As we hit the one-year mark on everything in my life collapsing, I‚Äôve decided to provide a (hopefully) final update on this long and strange saga. If this is all new to you, there‚Äôs a BORU that covers most of my original posts, and then my last update is also linked below. It‚Äôs pretty long, but the Tl;DR is that my wife had an emotional affair with my ex-best friend, who became a crazy stalker of first my wife, and then her sister, and it culminated in him writing a long unhinged email to my wife where he explained that they were soulmates who had been married in a prior life, and that he would always be there waiting for my wife, even decades from now. Creepy.

A few weeks ago, I had a heartfelt discussion with my wife where we recapped everything that happened over the last year, and I asked her a bunch of probing questions that got into the why and how the affair happened. I also gave her a one-time forgiveness window to get anything else off her chest, with the corresponding threat that if anything else material came out in the future, she‚Äôd be receiving divorce papers.

I learned a lot, and while it doesn‚Äôt excuse my wife‚Äôs misdeeds, I can empathize with her and her predicament. I now know that the emotional affair started earlier than she originally admitted, although it was a gradual shift from friendship to more, so it‚Äôs tough to pick a specific commencement date. It all started because Rick is fat, and my wife offered to help coach him on his weight loss journey. My wife successfully got down to her high school weight after our third kid, and she thought that if Rick implemented her diet, he could get down to a more reasonable weight himself. Initially, this meant she called him a couple of times a week to check in and see what he was eating, give tips, and ask if he had any questions. Apparently, they‚Äôd talk at the start of his lunch break, and she‚Äôd remind him to make good food choices.

I was supportive of her coaching, as Rick was my best friend at the time and his weight was a major source of marital strife (his wife thinks he let himself go and nags him constantly about his poor food choices). It also worked, as he lost weight with my wife's support. Over several months, they went from talking a few times a week to talking every weekday, and the topics expanded beyond Rick‚Äôs diet, with Rick‚Äôs marital issues becoming a major topic. My wife was now his therapist, in addition to his dietician. After a few months, my wife realized that Rick likely had an inappropriate attachment to her. She told me that he referred to her as ‚Äúgoddess‚Äù and hung onto every word she said. But he also hadn‚Äôt done anything overtly inappropriate (yet), and my wife assumed that he was a solid guy and wouldn‚Äôt take things further. She also admitted that she found the attention flattering, since he treated her like the smartest and most interesting person in the world.

Things veered into fully inappropriate on Christmas Day of ‚Äô23. My wife had been debating some outfits for New Year‚Äôs Eve, and she texted a couple options to both me and him (separately) and asked for thoughts. Around 1:00 a.m. that night, Rick responded with a text saying ‚Äúthis one‚Äù underneath one of the dresses, and he attached a short video of him masturbating (and ejaculating). I‚Äôve unfortunately seen the video.

My wife should have immediately told me. Instead, she tried to pretend like it never happened. She rationalized it on the basis of Rick being very drunk (he got into a fight with his wife on Christmas and went on a drunken bender that night), and she assumed that sober Rick would never have sent that text. She also knew that if she told me that it would blow up my friendship with Rick, and she was worried that it would taint the memory of Christmas for me. She also admitted that there was something a little flattering about knowing that she looked good enough in the outfit for someone to be masturbating to her in it.

To my wife‚Äôs credit, she cut off contact with Rick for several weeks. She missed their calls, however, and after we went on a cruise with Rick and his family for my birthday, and Rick acted normally during it, she resumed their weekday calls. She told me that she hoped things could go back to the way they were. Unfortunately, that wasn‚Äôt to be, and soon they were talking almost every day of the week (she‚Äôd talk to him on the weekends when I was off with the kids at their sporting events).

My wife‚Äôs sister actually warned her at this point that she felt the relationship was inappropriate, and my wife recognized that this was true but rationalized it as ‚Äúas long as it‚Äôs just talking and nothing physical happens, its not cheating‚Äù, especially since she had no physical or romantic attraction to Rick ‚Äì she just enjoyed the fawning attention. My wife also went through a mental health crisis during all this, since my wife is bipolar and her medication lost much of its efficacy. She told me at the time (and I wish I had acted on it sooner) that she was disassociating at times and feeling like her actions were not her own.

From there, what happened is covered in my other posts. There was one big update, however, and it is unfortunately a horrible one: Rick effectively sexually assaulted my wife. She had previously admitted that Rick kissed her when I went to the restroom. That is not quite the whole story. I remember the night, as it was several days before I discovered the affair. Rick had come over, and the three of us were drinking heavily and listening to music, and Rick was playing along to the songs on a guitar. Around 1:00 a.m., I decided to go to bed. My wife and Rick still wanted to hang, so I went up by myself. They were being too loud for me to sleep, however, so I decided to come back downstairs after 10 minutes or so. Walking down the stairs, I remember hearing what I thought sounded kind of like kissing sounds, but by the time I could see them everything seemed normal, so I chalked it up to my ears playing tricks. In our heart to heart, however, my wife admitted that they made out that night and that my ears didn‚Äôt deceive me. She doesn‚Äôt actually remember any of it ‚Äì she was black-out drunk that night and barely coherent. When we finally called it, I had to carry her up the stairs to our bedroom, where I helped her throw up before tucking her in bed. She only learned what happened the next day, when Rick apparently called and told her that he enjoyed their make-out session. She still feels intense shame for this, although I don‚Äôt fault her too much ‚Äì she was incredibly drunk and in no state to consent to anything, and what Rick did to her was legally sexual assault. For all I know, she may have thought she was kissing me (yes, she was that drunk). I wish she had told me all this sooner, as she was a victim that night, but she was too ashamed and embarrassed (particularly because it crossed her own internal line of ‚Äúas long as nothing physical happens it‚Äôs not cheating‚Äù) and so she instead made up the story of him kissing her while I went to the bathroom, which she admits was wrong.

Rick has thankfully fallen off the face of the earth, which is good, because I hate that fat fuck. I did run into him recently, and I (perhaps immaturely) told him that he was a pervert and a sexual predator. He stormed off, and I doubt I‚Äôll see much of him in the future. I also experience a great deal of schadenfreude in knowing that he‚Äôs gained a lot of weight ‚Äì he was probably 300 lbs when my wife started helping him, he got down to about 250 lbs with her help, and he is now up to probably 400 lbs. Good for him, I say. Meanwhile, my wife and I are doing well, and the trauma of the last year has surprisingly brought us closer together. She really is a fantastic person (notwithstanding everything that happened), she and has been a model wife and partner since I broke up the affair. So there is a happy ending, despite a ton of fucked up shit that has happened over the last 18 months.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** He was drunk, she was drunk, they both made out and yet she's a victim and he sexually assaulted her?. Umm....well whatever helps you sleep at night I guess.

> **OOP:** The difference was that he had been drinking but definitely still had his faculties. My wife was so drunk she couldn't walk. You're barely aware of your surroundings in that state. That feels very predatory, no?
>> 
>> **Commenter 1:** In that case then, you went upstairs to sleep and left your wife alone with a man in a state so drunk she couldn't walk?
>>> 
>>> **OOP:** That's fair. I would not have left my wife in that state with most men - I just trusted Rick and figured she was safe, given that she was in our own house and with someone I thought was a stand-up guy. I also don't think I realized just how drunk she was until I brought her upstairs - I had thought she was drunk, but not I can't walk drunk. But I definitely made a mistake that night - one I'll never make again.

**Commenter 2:** Wow man, you put up with so much more than any normal person would have. I hope your wife realizes how amazing you are bcz i sure see a lot of trickle truthing from your wife in every post.

> **OOP:** Oh she thankfully does. She's been an amazing spouse since this all happened - she realized that she almost blew up her life and is very lucky that I didn't leave her, and she's been trying to make it up to me. I effectively have unlimited brownie points at the moment.

I just couldn‚Äôt stand to live like this anymore. Usually, I ignore his constant barrage of insults but lately I started screaming over him the second he starts calling me names. Because that‚Äôs what he does to me when I‚Äôm trying to have a conversation with him. And in really heated situations where he‚Äôs touching me it helps make him back off because he knows we can be heard from outside if I‚Äôm screaming. Then he calls family or friends and says that I‚Äôm ‚Äúscreaming for no reason‚Äù and ‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt do anything‚Äù (5 minutes before that he called me a c*nt, trash, and told me to shut the f*ck up) But I can‚Äôt lie that I‚Äôm also scared of the future living alone for the first time. 

He pays half, if that, of what he‚Äôs supposed to pay for rent. And doesn‚Äôt help with Wi-Fi or electricity. He also doesn‚Äôt drive and I‚Äôm usually expected to take him to and from work if I‚Äôm not working. But says my job is trashy and he has a ‚Äúreal career‚Äù. He never cleans anything. He has never actually cleaned anything. Takes the trash out maybe. After it‚Äôs piled up for weeks. But won‚Äôt lift a finger elsewhere then blames it being dirty solely on me when he‚Äôs the one making huge messes and leaving them. I think I can manage to keep the place clean if he‚Äôs not around to leave messes everywhere. But the bills will be hard. When he does pay $300 towards our $1200 rent, it does help some. But it still means I was never able to save. He‚Äôs going to be taking the couch, tv, coffee table, really all of the major furniture. I have my bed and nightstand at my parents house but the dresser is too heavy to move. I have a tiny tv in the closet but I don‚Äôt have a stand for it, nor do I have a couch, or coffee table anymore. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll be possible to pay my bills and buy furniture, even if it‚Äôs $100-$200 used. Not to mention I‚Äôm having major dental issues but I can‚Äôt afford to see a dentist nor take the time off for the procedures I‚Äôd need. My life is a sh*t show. 

As he has leaving with his stuff, he was saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù and he was texting I love you also after he left. How can you say that when 10 minutes ago, you said you wish I would get sick and die?

**Emma Myers Digs In: The ‚ÄòWednesday‚Äô Star on Exploring the Overworld in ‚ÄòA Minecraft Movie,‚Äô Navigating Fandom Expectations and Returning as Enid**

Emma Myers‚Äô wanderlust extends beyond our world ‚Äî even beyond our reality.     

‚ÄúI am a fantasy lover ‚Äî it‚Äôs my favorite genre,‚Äù Myers says, noting how much she cherishes setting her phone aside to explore realms that don‚Äôt exist. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what I grew up reading; it‚Äôs what I grew up watching. I don‚Äôt know ‚Äî there‚Äôs just something so magical about it.‚Äù   

It‚Äôs late February, and we‚Äôre sipping matcha lattes on an unseasonably warm day in Marietta, Georgia, at a coffee shop the actress recommended. Nestled in a picturesque neighborhood, the caf√© looks like a scene lifted from a storybook, with a towering wooden bookcase lined with neatly arranged hardcovers and a patio surrounded by lush greenery. It‚Äôs a fitting retreat for Myers, and its enchanting charm mirrors the captivating presence she brings to her roles.

Her charisma is what stands out to those who have worked with Myers, who shot to stardom in 2022 with her breakout role as Enid Sinclair on the hit Netflix series ‚ÄúWednesday,‚Äù and went on to play an English teen detective on ‚ÄúA Good Girl‚Äôs Guide to Murder.‚Äù Now, she‚Äôs making her debut on the silver screen in ‚ÄúA Minecraft Movie,‚Äù the highly anticipated adaptation of the groundbreaking three-dimensional building game.

When Myers‚Äô collaborators reflect on their first impressions of her, several words come to mind: sweet, shy, humble and genuine, along with ‚Äúquiet strength‚Äù (the last observation courtesy of Tim Burton). And it‚Äôs no exaggeration.   

I show up 20 minutes before our 11 a.m. interview and sit on the patio, awaiting her arrival. When I message Myers‚Äô publicist about the actress‚Äôs ETA, she responds: ‚ÄúShe said she‚Äôs there.‚Äù It turns out Myers is inside; she arrived at least 10 minutes before me to ensure we‚Äôd have an ideal spot amid the sea of caffeinated customers with their laptops.     

She sits on the edge of a plush blue-velvet sofa near the entrance, dressed in a casual ensemble: a simple long-sleeved green top paired with light blue jeans, shearling ankle boots and a mini heart-shaped silver pendant. Her eyeglasses rest atop her chestnut bob, a striking contrast to her pastel-colored blonde hair on ‚ÄúWednesday.‚Äù

When I introduce myself, she springs off the cushion and exudes warmth, asking about my flight from New York and expressing genuine gratitude that we could meet near her home in Georgia. With her soft-spoken voice and aquamarine eyes, she radiates an aura of delicacy.     

I catch Myers before she embarks on her first-ever global press tour for Warner Bros. and Legendary‚Äôs ‚ÄúA Minecraft Movie,‚Äù out April 4. In her big-screen debut opposite Jack Black, Jason Momoa and Danielle Brooks, Myers ventures into the Overworld as Natalie, a savvy young adult who has just become the legal guardian of her little brother, Henry (Sebastian Hansen), after their mother‚Äôs death.     

‚ÄúShe is trying to be a sister, but also trying to be a parent to her brother at the same time, while working her first big-girl job,‚Äù Myers elaborates. ‚ÄúAnd she gets pulled into \[the Overworld\] with this cast of crazy characters. I wouldn‚Äôt say she is the voice of reason, but she is the most serious one.‚Äù     

Myers, 23, was an avid fan of the cubic video game growing up, drawn to the endless opportunities to tap into her creative side.      

‚ÄúYou can build what you want ‚Äî there‚Äôs no limitations,‚Äù Myers says. ‚ÄúI would spend my days making theme parks for sheep and would put them in mine carts and send them flying around. My friends and I would build escape rooms or fun little puzzle games for each other, and it was so interesting and so fun. There wasn‚Äôt a game like that before.‚Äù    

She would watch ‚ÄúMinecraft‚Äù commentaries on YouTube, especially enjoying the videos uploaded by gaming YouTuber Stampy Cat. ‚ÄúMy friends and I were obsessed with him. We had T-shirts with his logo on them,‚Äù Myers says. ‚ÄúHe held a contest one time ‚Äî and I don‚Äôt remember if we had to make up a song or build something ‚Äî but we submitted it, and I remember us being like, ‚ÄòOh my God, we‚Äôre gonna win. We‚Äôre gonna win this contest.‚Äô ‚Ä¶ We did not win.‚Äù     

There was no need for Myers to undergo a formal audition process for ‚ÄúA Minecraft Movie,‚Äù as director Jared Hess and the film‚Äôs producers admired her work on projects like ‚ÄúWednesday‚Äù and the fantasy-comedy film ‚ÄúFamily Switch,‚Äù in which she swaps bodies with Jennifer Garner.    

Instead, Myers received a call from her manager with an offer for a Momoa film shooting in New Zealand. ‚ÄúI was like, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs so awesome. What is it?‚Äô And she was like, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs called ‚Äî ‚ÄòThe Craft Mine‚Äô or something-‚ÄòMine.‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôve got to be kidding me. I played this game when I was a kid!‚Äô‚Äù    

A month after meeting with ‚ÄúA Minecraft Movie‚Äù producer Cale Boyter and sending a video to Hess, in which she raved about the opportunity, they asked her if she could fly down to New Zealand in two weeks. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs such a cool part about this job,‚Äù Myers says. ‚ÄúSometimes you have no idea what you‚Äôre doing, and then all of a sudden, you get called to do something that changes your life just like that.‚Äù    

She didn‚Äôt have any contact with her co-stars until they met in person in New Zealand, which Myers calls an ‚Äúinsane thing,‚Äù since actors usually have a chemistry read or even a simple Zoom meeting before heading into production together. ‚ÄúBut it just worked out really well that we all clicked and that the cast is so small.‚Äù     

‚ÄúA Minecraft Movie‚Äù merges meticulously crafted practical designs ‚Äî from blocky outdoor landscapes to cuboid watermelons ‚Äî with computer-generated elements. While the cast did perform against green screens, Myers says they observed mock-ups and reference images to visualize the Overworld and its iconic creatures, helping to bring the immersive world to life.    

‚ÄúSometimes it‚Äôs hard when you‚Äôre acting against a tennis ball and you don‚Äôt know what something looks like,‚Äù Myers says. ‚ÄúBut I played these games, so when they‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòThe Iron Golem is up there,‚Äô I knew exactly what it looked like. It‚Äôs not really hard for me to picture it. And because the props and all the practical stuff were so good, it didn‚Äôt even matter that we were on a soundstage the whole time. You hold a square apple, and it‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù     

‚ÄúShe just totally understood the world,‚Äù Hess says. ‚ÄúIt was funny, she and Jack Black were always playing ‚ÄòMinecraft.‚Äô They were super Method. She‚Äôd be on her Nintendo Switch and dive in deep.‚Äù     

The film involved a copious amount of stunt work performed by Myers, who took on roughly 90% of the action sequences herself.    

‚ÄúI‚Äôve done stunts and I‚Äôve done fight scenes before, but I‚Äôve never done them with props or weapons,‚Äù Myers says. ‚ÄúThis was the first time I got to use a sword and a shovel and hit somebody. And that is so different from falling down a flight of stairs or punching somebody. It‚Äôs so different because it‚Äôs so precise, and it was a challenge, but a good challenge. It was really satisfying to be able to do your own stuff and be like, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs me.‚Äô‚Äù    

A ‚ÄúMinecraft‚Äù game-to-film adaptation was first announced in 2014, the same year Microsoft acquired Mojang Studios ‚Äî the developer behind the multi-platform sandbox game ‚Äî for $2.5 billion. Since its official release in 2011, ‚ÄúMinecraft‚Äù has become the bestselling video game of all time, with more than 300 million copies sold.    

But bringing ‚ÄúMinecraft‚Äù to the big screen hasn‚Äôt been easy. After years of shifting directors ‚Äî including Shawn Levy, Rob McElhenney and Peter Sollett ‚Äî and multiple script rewrites, a finalized production plan came to fruition in 2022, with Hess taking the helm. Myers admits there‚Äôs a bit of pressure to deliver a film that resonates with ‚ÄúMinecraft‚Äù fans, especially after such a long and tumultuous development process.    

‚ÄúI feel like if it would satisfy me as a kid who played, then it‚Äôll satisfy others. And I‚Äôm very happy with it, and I hope others are too,‚Äù Myers says. ‚ÄúThere is definitely that pressure of ‚ÄòOh my God, we have to get it perfect ‚Äî we have to get it right.‚Äô But at the end of the day, we all had so much fun working on this movie.‚Äù    

Aside from the ‚ÄúMinecraft‚Äù video game, Myers has admired other fantastical realms since she was a child growing up in Orlando, Florida. Raised by two lawyers, she was homeschooled alongside her siblings ‚Äî one older and two younger sisters ‚Äî because, Myers says, their mother preferred a ‚Äúhands-on education‚Äù approach.    

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so grateful for her because she quit her job as a lawyer to homeschool us and then got back into work later,‚Äù Myers says. ‚ÄúI really think it helped me. I quite loved being homeschooled, because I had so much freedom.‚Äù     

She says that finding a sense of community was occasionally challenging, but through extracurricular activities like local theater and dance, she was able to form friendships. Plus, she had her sisters.     

At the age of 5, Myers began her pursuit of acting after accompanying her older sister to auditions for commercials and other projects in Orlando. ‚ÄúI just wanted to do whatever my older sister was doing at the time.‚Äù    

Although her sister chose to follow their parents‚Äô path and is now pursuing a law degree, Myers never felt drawn to that profession. ‚ÄúI am not very book-smart,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúI always felt like, if I didn‚Äôt do acting, I love animals and I would love to be a zookeeper or work on an animal sanctuary.‚Äù   

Her passion for fantasy stemmed from beloved franchises like ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Lord of the Rings.‚Äù She would watch behind-the-scenes video diaries of the ‚ÄúLord of the Rings‚Äù trilogy in which director Peter Jackson shared insights into the filmmaking process.   

‚ÄúI was so obsessed with those movies, and I remember watching \[the videos\] on YouTube and thinking, ‚ÄòI want to do that so badly. I want to be a part of that,‚Äô‚Äù Myers says.      

It‚Äôs no surprise to hear that while filming ‚ÄúA Minecraft Movie,‚Äù she spent her downtime exploring the breathtaking landscapes of New Zealand ‚Äî the same landscapes that brought the world of Jackson‚Äôs ‚ÄúLord of the Rings‚Äù films to life. ‚ÄúI spent all my free time trying to go on all the hikes they went on. It‚Äôs been on my bucket list for years,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI went to Hobbiton. I did the Mordor hike, which is the Tongariro Alpine Crossing. That was probably one of the hardest hikes I‚Äôve ever done. It was really, really cool, though, to see where they filmed things, or what inspired images in the films.‚Äù    

Myers had unwavering support in her acting endeavors from her mother, who recorded all her self-tape auditions and traveled to nearly every gig with her. ‚ÄúMy dad took a little bit of time to warm up to it,‚Äù she says with a laugh.     

But the constant rejection or lack of responses from casting directors, coupled with the unpredictable nature of booking work, eventually wore on Myers. When she was 12, she made the decision to take a hiatus from acting.    

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs such a hard age, especially because you‚Äôre going through puberty ‚Äî you‚Äôre growing, and you can change like that,‚Äù she explains, adding, ‚ÄúBut I really got to be a teenager; I got to hang out with my friends all the time. I‚Äôm so glad I took that break because it let me experience what I needed to experience.‚Äù    

Myers pivoted her focus to competitive dancing ‚Äî picture ‚ÄúDance Moms,‚Äù she says ‚Äî and performed a variety of styles, with contemporary and jazz being her favorites. She credits her dance background with helping her excel in the more physically demanding aspects of acting. ‚ÄúSo much is choreography based, and you have to learn things really fast,‚Äù she says of stunt work. ‚ÄúI think \[dance\] also helps you, as an actor, be in tune with your body and know your own body so well.‚Äù 

When she was 16, her family moved to Atlanta, often referred to as the Hollywood of the South. Inspired by the vast entertainment scene, where Marvel blockbusters such as ‚ÄúSpider-Man: Homecoming‚Äù and ‚ÄúAvengers: Infinity War,‚Äù as well as shows like ‚ÄúStranger Things‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Walking Dead,‚Äù were filmed, she decided to revisit acting.    

Myers landed several television guest roles and appeared in the 2021 Lifetime movie ‚ÄúGirl in the Basement,‚Äù but it wasn‚Äôt until her portrayal of Enid Sinclair on ‚ÄúWednesday‚Äù that she experienced her first real success. In the series, her bubbly, rainbow-clad werewolf character diverges sharply from her roommate, Jenna Ortega‚Äôs stoic and sinister Wednesday Addams, making it challenging for them to connect. However, for the two young stars, bonding was anything but complicated. 

‚ÄúI think Emma and I have a similar professional stance and understanding of our job, so anytime we shot together, we could trust things to go completely smoothly. She makes my job so much easier,‚Äù Ortega tells Variety. ‚ÄúSeason 1, we hit the ground running; Wednesday is pulled in every direction, and with Emma, shooting was just perfect. We also bonded over uncomfortable skin-tight cat costumes and taking naps on the floor of our tent during long days. We just understand each other. She became a sister of mine very quickly.‚Äù     

‚ÄúHer reactions to Wednesday ‚Äî her sense of comedy, her sense of drama ‚Äî the emotion she brings to the character, it‚Äôs great. And I think that‚Äôs a reason that they‚Äôve become such an iconic duo,‚Äù Al Gough, co-showrunner of ‚ÄúWednesday,‚Äù says of Myers‚Äô chemistry with Ortega. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like two great tennis players, right? They are so good together; they‚Äôre friends in real life, and you can feel their friendship. They continually make each other better.‚Äù    

During the first season of ‚ÄúWednesday,‚Äù Myers underwent stunt training every day she wasn‚Äôt shooting, including a ‚Äúwerewolf boot camp,‚Äù to prepare for her role. There, she practiced aerial flips, kip-ups and even crawling on all fours.    

‚ÄúEmma is always up for anything. In Season 1, she did this incredible stunt, like, 15 times of rolling out of a dumbwaiter. Looking at that as a parent, I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòThis is insane. We can‚Äôt let the actors do this,‚Äô‚Äù recalls ‚ÄúWednesday‚Äù co-showrunner Miles Millar. ‚ÄúBut she started as a dancer and has a physicality, and there‚Äôs a Lucille Ball element to her as well. I think the physical comedy is really special and unique to her.‚Äù    

As a relatively unknown actress during the ‚ÄúWednesday‚Äù Season 1 phenomenon, Myers was frequently asked whether she identified as an extrovert ‚Äî like Enid ‚Äî or as an introvert. She always answered the latter and, years later, still feels the same.

‚ÄúI think as an introvert, if you work in this job, you have to learn to ‚Äî not necessarily put up a front ‚Äî but to be an extrovert when you need to be. And I find that I‚Äôve become so much more comfortable with that,‚Äù she says.     

After wrapping production on ‚ÄúA Minecraft Movie‚Äù in New Zealand, Myers headed straight to Ireland to film ‚ÄúWednesday‚Äù Season 2. (‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even go to the ‚ÄòMinecraft‚Äô wrap party because I had to get on a flight the next morning. I was out of there,‚Äù she says.) It was her first time returning to a character ‚Äî an opportunity that excited Myers but also made her anxious.   

‚ÄúI was kind of scared to go back, because I remember watching scenes of myself from Season 1 and being like, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know if I can re-create this now. It‚Äôs been so long,‚Äô‚Äù she recalls. ‚ÄúBut when we got to the table read, it immediately came back, like nothing had changed. I think I‚Äôve lived with Enid for so long, it comes very naturally now.    

‚ÄúAlso, there‚Äôs no harm in changing things up, because \[Enid\] has changed over the summer. She‚Äôs grown, and she‚Äôs become more comfortable with herself.‚Äù     

Ortega echoes similar sentiments about Myers‚Äô Enid, noting that she‚Äôs ‚Äúa bit more of a badass this time around.‚Äù She adds, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs interesting how, while Wednesday will never admit it if she doesn‚Äôt have to, she really does have a friend.‚Äù     

Filming ‚ÄúWednesday‚Äù Season 2 marked Myers‚Äô first reunion with a director ‚Äî and not just any director, but Burton, who has helmed several episodes and serves as an executive producer on the series. However, Myers wasn‚Äôt intimidated to work with him again, thanks to their initial collaboration a few years prior.    

‚ÄúI think Season 1, everybody was quite nervous around him because we‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòAh, it‚Äôs Tim Burton. Don‚Äôt let him get upset with you ‚Äî just be good. He‚Äôs so iconic,‚Äô‚Äù Myers recalls. ‚ÄúBut over the course of Season 1, we were just like, ‚ÄòOh wait, he‚Äôs just the coolest guy ever. He‚Äôs so chill.‚Äô ‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs very open to things ‚Äî he loves rehearsing and going with the scenes based on how we rehearsed.‚Äù     

‚ÄúShe just surprises you all the time,‚Äù Burton says of Myers. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt really learn till this season that she could dance so well. She‚Äôs not overly demonstrative as a person, so she just kept surprising me, just with her level of humor and her ability to be chromatic and humorous. I like a mixture of people that can do comedy and be emotional at the same time ‚Äî and she‚Äôs got all of those elements.‚Äù     

The second season does not feature several actors from the first ‚Äî notably, Percy Hynes White, who faced sexual assault allegations in 2023. Hynes White portrayed Xavier Thorpe, the enigmatic Nevermore Academy student poised to become a more prominent love interest for Wednesday ‚Äî but he does not return.     

‚ÄúI feel like the script goes in a very specific direction that it‚Äôs not a big worry,‚Äù Myers says of the absent characters. ‚ÄúThis season especially is so character driven, and there‚Äôs so much happening. It just makes so much sense to have the characters we have and to have the story we have. I think fans will appreciate it.‚Äù     

It‚Äôs an impressive feat to land the No. 4 spot on the call sheet for your first regular role on a series like ‚ÄúWednesday‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs even rarer to subsequently lead your own.

Less than two years after the debut of ‚ÄúWednesday,‚Äù Myers branched out to solve a five-year-old cold case under the guise of a high school project in ‚ÄúA Good Girl‚Äôs Guide to Murder.‚Äù In the British mystery series, Myers stars as Pippa ‚ÄúPip‚Äù Fitz-Amobi, an astute and compassionate true-crime enthusiast determined to uncover the truth behind the murder of a popular schoolgirl.    

‚ÄúI think I relate to Pip the most, and I think that‚Äôs what‚Äôs really hard about her,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always hard to portray somebody who‚Äôs actually very close to how you are in real life ‚Äî unlike playing somebody who‚Äôs very different, because you can be so out there and so different from yourself that you don‚Äôt feel really insecure about it.‚Äù     

Myers had only two weeks of training with a dialect coach to master a British accent before filming ‚ÄúA Good Girl‚Äôs Guide to Murder‚Äù Season 1 ‚Äî a daunting challenge, as she didn‚Äôt want to join the ranks of American actors who faltered with it.    

‚ÄúThat was my biggest thing, is that it is such a stereotype for Americans doing British accents to be awful at it. I really didn‚Äôt want to do that, but I only had two weeks, so it is what it is,‚Äù Myers says. She made a point of asking the cast and crew to correct her intonations and inflections if needed. ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm not gonna get offended. If I say something wrong, please tell me,‚Äù she would say.  

Now, she feels much more confident, having had ample time to perfect her British accent through dialect training after the murder-mystery series was renewed for another season. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had a few sessions with my coach already, and what‚Äôs funny is that she‚Äôll give me exercises for nonnative English speakers who are learning English ‚Äî and learning British English. I was like, ‚ÄòHuh, that‚Äôs such an odd thing,‚Äô but it‚Äôs actually so tricky.‚Äù    

Three of Myers‚Äô most notable projects to date are adaptations: ‚ÄúA Good Girl‚Äôs Guide to Murder,‚Äù based on Holly Jackson‚Äôs bestselling YA mystery series that gained immense popularity within the BookTok community on TikTok; ‚ÄúWednesday,‚Äù which brings to life the macabre daughter from the classic ‚ÄúAddams Family‚Äù franchise; and now, ‚ÄúA Minecraft Movie.‚Äù  

Myers agrees there‚Äôs an increased, even unique, pressure that comes with navigating the expectations of established fandoms.    

‚ÄúEspecially with ‚ÄòGood Girls,‚Äô because it‚Äôs a book-to-TV adaptation. It‚Äôs very specific, whereas ‚ÄòWednesday‚Äô is an adaptation, but there‚Äôs more freedom in that because I‚Äôm a new character. ‚ÄòMinecraft,‚Äô I‚Äôm a new character,‚Äù Myers says. ‚Äú‚ÄòGood Girls‚Äô is from page to screen, and that came with a lot of pressure because people can read the same book and have wildly different interpretations of the character ‚Äî of the story. And I wanted to make sure that, if my interpretation of it was different than somebody else‚Äôs, it still felt accurate and real ‚Äî it still felt like it made sense to everybody. And I hope I did a good job of that.‚Äù     

But she doesn‚Äôt view these pressures in a negative light. ‚ÄúI do think about it when we‚Äôre prepping, for sure, because if you say, ‚ÄòUgh, don‚Äôt worry about it ‚Äî I‚Äôll do what I want,‚Äô then you‚Äôre not gonna please very many people. And the goal is to please as many people as possible with your work,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt worry about it in the sense of ‚ÄòOh my God, what if I don‚Äôt get it right? What if you hate me?‚Äô I try not to stress myself out. I just take that pressure and make it work.‚Äù    

This mindset goes beyond just handling pressure on set. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so many paths I can take and so many roles that I could do, where I can even stop acting and start doing stuff behind the camera,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so many doors that have opened up because of this, and I‚Äôm so grateful.‚Äù     

She expresses a keen interest in exploring genres such as romance, musicals ‚Äî her all-time favorite is ‚ÄúPhantom of the Opera‚Äù ‚Äî and sci-fi (‚ÄúI‚Äôm obsessed with ‚ÄòRed Rising‚Äô by Pierce Brown‚Äù). Naturally, fantasy comes up, and the opinions of fandoms don‚Äôt deter her from dreaming of joining new adaptations of ‚ÄúThe Chronicles of Narnia‚Äù and ‚ÄúPirates of the Caribbean.‚Äù    

In the meantime, she‚Äôs appreciative of the steady work she‚Äôs had. After a weekslong press cycle for ‚ÄúA Minecraft Movie,‚Äù she‚Äôll begin production on ‚ÄúA Good Girl‚Äôs Guide to Murder‚Äù Season 2 in April, where she‚Äôll slip back into her British accent to investigate another mystery as Pip. ‚ÄúWednesday‚Äù Season 2 is then slated for release later this year, and fans will once again see what antics Enid and Wednesday are up to at Nevermore.     

Beyond that, Myers remains mum. ‚ÄúI do have plans, but I‚Äôm not sure I can share,‚Äù she teases, drawing out the last word with a playful grin that instantly evokes Enid. Besides, like many people in their 20s who are finding their way, Myers prefers not to look too far ahead.   

‚ÄúThe undetermined future is a crazy thing for me, but it‚Äôs almost comforting not having anything planned out,‚Äù she says.    

Regardless of what lies ahead in her career, it‚Äôs not lost on Myers that she was ‚Äî and is ‚Äî an avid member of multiple fandoms, and how surreal it is now to be the subject of one.

‚ÄúI went to ‚ÄòStar Wars‚Äô conventions; I would go and see every Marvel movie on opening day. I was a fan of so much,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt is so wild to then receive that sort of love back that I had put into other things. And I‚Äôm so grateful for everybody who has supported me and the stuff that I‚Äôve done. You put that much time and effort into something growing up, and then you have people putting that much time and effort into what you do ‚Äî it‚Äôs so mind-boggling.‚Äù

Authorities say the 18-year-old‚Äôs choice of hummus ‚Äútriggered some alarms,‚Äù given the ‚Äúsuperior snack alternatives, including Pop-Tarts and microwave Velveeta.‚Äù Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Press Secretary Paloma Chacon called Hermosillo‚Äôs detention ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù given her ‚ÄúIslamic features.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe fight for freedom starts in the kitchen, and Miss Hermosillo clearly chose the other side. Her friends in Palestine named themselves after a food for Christ‚Äôs sake,‚Äù Chacon said before the press. One reporter asked if she was referring to the student‚Äôs brown skin, to which Chacon replied, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say that, you did. I don‚Äôt see color.‚Äù When another noted that many ethnic groups have brown skin, Chacon became visibly defensive. ‚ÄúI eat Mexican food all the time, I have never seen hummus in a tortilla.‚Äù

While there is no evidence of Hermosillo having any connection or interest in Israel‚Äôs genocide in Gaza, she remains held inside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) center. One detention officer is confident that the government made the right call. ‚ÄúUSC has Panda Express on campus, they‚Äôve got Coffee Bean. She could have eaten anything. You don‚Äôt order something weird unless you miss the taste of home.‚Äù

This officer, it should be noted, did not go to college. When asked why that was, he grumbled something about student loans.

I pulled up to the drive-thru just trying to get a cup of coffee, and instead, I got hit with the full force of weaponized enthusiasm.

*""HEY BESTIE! HOW'S YOUR BEAUTIFUL DAY GOING?!""*

Excuse me? We have never met. And it is 6:30 in the morning. You don‚Äôt know what kind of day I‚Äôm having because it hasn‚Äôt even started yet.

I stared blankly, hoping if I didn‚Äôt respond, they would just hand me my coffee and let me go. But no. The Dutch Bros worker was dangling halfway out the window like some kind of caffeinated cryptid, grinning like they‚Äôd just unlocked the secrets of the universe.

*""What‚Äôs the most exciting thing you‚Äôre doing today?! Any FUN PLANS?!""*

Bro. My only plan right now is to leave this drive-thru alive.

Hold up, let‚Äôs talk about the coffee itself really quick. Dutch Bros doesn‚Äôt sell coffee, they sell diabetes in a cup. Every drink sounds like something Willy Wonka invented after pulling an all-nighter. ""Caramelized sugar-rush turbo-blast with extra whip and a side of instant regret!"" No thank you!

Okay back to the story.

I tried to escape by ordering just a black coffee, thinking that would get me out of this high-energy hostage situation faster. Big mistake.

*""Omg just BLACK COFFEE? Hardcore! You must be bummed out, like, are you going through something?*

Yes. I‚Äôm going through not wanting to talk to you before sunrise.

Meanwhile, at 7-Eleven, the cashier doesn‚Äôt even make eye contact. I could walk in covered in blood and bees, and they wouldn‚Äôt say a word. They‚Äôd just ring me up, grunt, and go back to watching a telenovela on their phone. That‚Äôs the level of human interaction I need before my first cup of coffee.

And the coffee? 7-Eleven coffee is the drink of warriors. It‚Äôs been sitting there for an unknown amount of time, simmering into a molten, slightly burnt, legally questionable elixir of life. It tastes like decisions. It tastes like responsibility. Dutch Bros coffee tastes like a *frosted birthday cake having a panic attack.*

At Dutch Bros, I left feeling like I‚Äôd joined a cult by accident. At 7-Eleven, I left with a caffeine buzz and my sanity intact.

Winner: 7-Eleven. Every time.

This story takes place over the span of around 35 years beginning with a dream! A dream that I had when I was in the seventh grade at the time. 

Having a sleepover at a friend‚Äôs house from school at the time with fiend being Joshua Davis‚Äô with me remembering telling him at the time about the dream that next morning.

Just as we were heading to the local comic shop I remembered telling him about it. 

Seeing a blonde haired girl standing there holding a skateboard. 

A picture that would come to haunt me years later in a way that I would have never felt possible.

But Periodically at different times earlier in my life! I could remember them showing me some of them in separate dreams.

For as the years went by I would all but forget about having the dreams until one night when I was living on my own. 

When another dream I would have! But this dream would be much more darker! With a much more realistic feel to it! 

For in the dream I could see an older blonde haired woman! Standing there in the flames holding up what seemed to be a paper. With her pointing to the paper. Seeing her face as she Stood there in agony screaming in pain! Saying to me

‚ÄòDon‚Äôt Do It‚Äô

Pointing to the paper she was holding up in her hand. Just as a strange frightening eerie feeling would suddenly came over me! 

A feeling of dread then began coming over me! A feeling of that I had no idea of what or who was to come ! In

The Days To Come 

Just as the woman in the flames then suddenly vanished! 

But the strange thing was that the woman in the flames wasn‚Äôt any of the girls that I would write on!

I don‚Äôt know who she was!

That was when faces of different girls began to appear showing them one by one! showing only certain aspects of their faces! leaving other aspects darkened. 

As if they were faces from a picture not knowing at the time who they were I would really fully never know!

But just as the last face vanished! It showed a group of what seemed to be photos being showed to me with a date on it!

Photos that had something written on them! With the last photo showing a girl in the photo standing there dressed in all in White! 

With the time on the photo either ending in 27 or 29
I just kinda remember seeing the numbers 24, 25, 27 and 29
At the top of the photo! Where the time of day would appear 

But for ever since I could remember I had always had a fear over a movie. With the movie being 

‚Äò Carrie‚Äô 

That had came out in 1976. Never really knowing why until I went to see the one that came out in 2013 with 

Chloe Grace Moretz‚Äô

For on that day I would truly understand why I had always had a fear over this movie. 

That is when it all started! A week or two had gone by with the feeling never leaving me! A feeling that was inside of me that was urging me urging me to write something!

And write something I did! 

A binding contract! 

The first one! But what I did not know at the time was that many more would follow!

But the strange thing was! When I wrote the first one! It wasn‚Äôt a specific time like 11:11 or a specific star alignment! 

No! It was just random! At around two o‚Äôclock in the afternoon! In a local coffee shop of all places! 

But strangely since then the coffee shop has since changed hands several times after! But the more frightening thing was still to come! One of my friends from school John Seymour,‚Äô had took over the coffee shop.

Not too long after that he was ran over and killed in a motorcycle accident! 

The coffee shop was mojo‚Äôs it now goes by a different name 

But later that night I could remember being forced awake seeing a hand reaching for my face followed with the feeling of something being ripped through my face! Falling to the floor as I grasping for air! 

As the morning would come I found myself at work feeling emotionally drained from life from a lack of sleep. As a feeling of eeriness was all around me a feeling of like sweating but I wasn‚Äôt sweating! a feeling that is really unexplainable and that was when I first saw them! 

With the first one seeming as if he just suddenly appeared out of nowhere!

The very first noticeable thing about him was his eyes with what seemed to be a white light coming from his eyes for a split second walking a short distance away from me. But oddly enough I could remember I was given his name with his name being 

‚ÄúMccoy!‚Äù

And that is when I noticed the second one! Waking towards me! this one a female with a walk that did not seem human even though both  looked human from a distance. 

And that is when I looked into her eyes! 

Eyes that one could tell were not that of a human! From up close as the white around her blackened pupils was more like a solid pure pearl white! 

Much more than a human eye color could be making it that every photo that I would see after that.

I would only see the person eyes as if I was looking at her eyes! Grinning as she walked by me her looked said it all 

‚Äú You belong to us now‚Äù! 

Just as the male then walked over to me grabbing my hand just as he slid his finger up the palm of my hand with both of them then leaving just as quickly as they came. 

But through the years many more would come!

And for the next eleven years the dreams would come and go! Dreams showing me the girls that I would write a binding contract on. 

With the dreams also showing me things that they would be doing in a television show or movie! While at the same time opening a door revealing the next girl.

For example in one dream it showed Elizabeth Olsen driving a certain car make and the following day! 

With it showing the exact scene in the TV show. With the television show being WandaVision 

While in the dream showing her getting out of the car walking over to a door opening it up revealing the next girl. 

With another dream, a dream that just did not feel like a dream! A dream showing a possible up coming movie possibly starring the same actress.

It showed a scene of her Elizabeth Olsen standing there in a park like setting wearing clothing that of a park ranger. With her then taking off running followed by three men running after her! 

With the scenery then suddenly changing to showing train tracks going up the side of a mountain. With it then showing what seemed to be an old storage building, when it then showed the actor Benedict Wong

He was walking around in it as he then picked up a note book and a pencil as if he was about to write something down. As he then looked to me like I was to write down what I just saw.

But that was when I woke up but as I was walking to the bathroom I felt different very different! 

For I was waking in Elizabeth Olsen‚Äôs body! I could feel her body all around me as it then just faded away.

But this dream was from two to three years ago!

But just as in the second dream would show different faces!

One by one! 

That I would encounter each of the girls not all of them but some of them Just to show  me that they could until the final one. 

For one night while at work, being close to closing time as I approached the end of an aisle.
A girl pushing a shopping cart as then suddenly came around the corner. With the girl being a very famous actress! Miranda Cosgrove‚Äô

While encountering other very famous actresses and a very famous singer at that! At different times! With them 
Being Emma Watson‚Äô Elle Fanning‚Äô Maisie Williams‚Äô Kristen Stewart‚Äô Ariana Granda‚Äô Elizabeth Gillies‚Äô Avril Lavigne‚Äô Jennette Mccurdy‚Äô
And Christina Ricci‚Äô

And now back to the second dream! For the paper that the woman in the flames was holding up! what i thought could have been a binding contract! 

May have been something entirely different!

With me now believing to be short stories! Short stories that was sent in to a YouTuber! With the YouTuber being 

Robert Meyer Burnett‚Äô 

for a contest around four years ago. 

For one day while at work, a very famous actress Natalie Portman‚Äô would come in shopping with her family.

With her then asking if we had a product in stock in which we did not at the time. But as she and her family walked away I overheard her say that she liked one of my short stories! a short story that was sent to this YouTuber. 

The short story was titled

 ‚ÄòA place in Heaven‚Äô

While mentioning another short story that included another very famous actress!

Being ‚ÄòAlone‚Äô

Another instance on the short stories happened when two YouTubers one of them being Robert Meyer Burnett‚Äô were talking about upcoming releases from CinemaCon. 

But just as their stream had seemed to end or so they thought had ended. They then started talking between themselves with one of them seemingly not really being to sure of this. For all he heard all day‚Äô 

Was! What about ‚ÄòAbby‚Äô 

But as they talked amongst themselves lasting about a ten seconds about the project that the executives of a certain studio that was interested in it at the time. 

But for one! I am in no way talking bad about either of these YouTubers.

For if it wasn‚Äôt for that! The actress would have never even seen that short story.

But Remember! What this story is about! The short stories were just a small part of this! 

With the studio being Paramount 

But needed! For This was just to show me what they were capable of doing! 
To show me!

Even if my stories came in Dead last! They were other people with stories involved 

I mean they were contest stories to begin with!

But another very famous actress would walk by me! The actress being Anya Taylor Joy‚Äô A very talented actress at that

With me over hearing her say that she had been asked about doing ‚ÄòAbby‚Äô

That would be great if it happened! 

While at another time another very talented famous actress! With her being Zendaya‚Äô that I also over heard that she was also asked about ‚ÄòAbby‚Äô

And that would be great as well! Two very talented actress‚Äôs that have been possibly asked about doing ‚ÄòAbby‚Äô

But no matter if anything even comes of these stories, I will always remember hearing a much beloved actress liked my short story

‚ÄòA place in Heaven‚Äô

And now back to the second dream

Just as I then heard a loud crashing noise around me not being able to move!

( Feeling his arms wrapping around me! Feeling a tongue sliding up and down the side of my face! )

hearing a voice saying 

‚Äú I will rip the flesh from his body‚Äù! 

Just as a second voice then said 

‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt dead yet we can‚Äôt take him‚Äù 

the voices began to fade I heard one last thing with on of them saying. 

‚Äú He will become a girl!‚Äù

‚ÄúThen I rip her flesh from her body!‚Äù

35 years later! After the first dream, Just a little over a two years ago while I working around closing time. Standing there at the service desk!When I just happened to look up only to see the girl that was in the photo from the first the first dream. And standing there in front of me was none other than her Dakota Fanning‚Äô

But now since two years have since passed, while at work just I then looked over only to see another very famous actress. The actress being Elizabeth Olsen‚Äô

As she then walked by me but it wasn‚Äôt until later that I would see one of her very famous sisters! One of the Olsen Twins! standing there in front of me

For One by one! Till the final one! 

With me Never Knowing until the end! Until then I will never know!

But on one occurrence near the beginning of this!

I could remember one night ripping up a binding contract! One that was on a set of photos! 

When the next morning came! I went to bathroom setting there on the floor looking up at me. 

Was the piece of the photo that had the girl‚Äôs name on it.

For even if one does rip up a binding contract, if it still remains in your heart! It still remains! 

On a different note! Still belonging very much so with the story itself little over eight years ago while at work.

My pastor Johnny Osborne‚Äô at the time had came in shopping stoping next to me to buy just as he was about to say something to me.

A Laugh I heard! With not only me hearing it but I could see the look in his eyes as I looked to him as he suddenly looked in the direction of the laugh.

It wasn‚Äôt even but a couple of months later that I had heard that he just left! Not only the church! But his family as well.

Never to hear what really happened to him, but from that day on, but I knew in my heart what had happened that day.

For the Demon that laughed was basically letting me know that I was going to go through this on my own 

Along with the dreams came many warnings! One such warning came with a dream, after writing one! One of many! In the dream, I was the girl that I had written on! I was setting in a darkened place along with them in their true form! As they were before falling setting there with me.

When one of them then looked to me as he then placed  his hand on top of my head. saying to me

‚ÄúSo you want to be down here with us!‚Äù

For one night I remember being woken up just as I looked over only to see something scrolling through my phone! At one that was written on my phone. Just as the scrolling then suddenly stopped on her photo! As I then felt a hand smack me on my eye.

With the girl being 

Jennifer Lawrence 

But for now another dream I had and in the dream different things it showed me. Not of any celebrities but of things that I would see.

And the very next day I would see! For in the dream it showed me two different things that I would see on

YouTube that day.

One of them being a woman in a coat walking and the next was a dollar amount. With both happening in the same video the same woman in the coat and the exact dollar amount that I heard.

But just before the dream had ended I was handed a remote! Meaning that the control of what was to come was now in my control the fate of my soul was now in my hands. 

For since I was young I had always lived my life for Christ 

For nothing has been done that cannot be undone
There is still time for forgiveness to repent

But the day will come when a choice must be made! 

For here is an example of Angels being among us, I was stopped at a four way stop, where a man was standing there asking for donations.

When I then gave him a Dollar I could see the look on his face! He had the look of pure horror that had come over him.

For I could see that he was looking over at my phone!

For a human being could not have sensed that without knowing what they were. 

For when I was younger I remember a dream that I had not really remembering what exactly was in the dream 

I just remember the words 

Days To Come

But also in the dreams it was made very clear to me!

that no harm shall come to any of the girls or any other mentioned here.

For I am the only one that will be affected by this other than my direct family

But a while back a person came in wearing a grey hoodie and jeans with their hoodie covering their blonde hair. But strangely enough I felt who it was, for I could feel it as I Looked up and saw them walking towards me. 

I know who it was

But as in the dream one by one! 

And one by one they did

For everyone that was in the dream has come, for just as I turned an ale the final one walked by me was a very famous actress 

Wearing sunglasses and a hat! 

But the one question still remains! And may never be known!

But at any given time! Maybe during the filming of the movie ‚ÄòNoah‚Äô did anyone on the set happen to have a conversation to Emma Watson‚Äô Maybe about an immortal character being from the time of Noah‚Äô

Or maybe even when Dakota Fanning was younger maybe she read a script like 

‚ÄòA Place In Heaven‚Äô

One could say that bending reality is beyond belief. One can say that this story is beyond belief. Or is it! 

For if someone was to will something to happen. Could they!

 For bending reality is to will something to happen In a way that one would never even notice it.

Knowing and understanding that this was what I asked for. 

But in the end I would know! I would know that I lost everything! My Family, My Son, My Home, forcing me to move back home. But the worst part was not seeing him growing up.

I mean when i spent all of my time hunting for photos! Writing these! Which was best guess being around three to four thousand of them over the span of 12 years! You basically spend all of your time doing that

Some people just write one! With some going crazy or found dead soon after! But not all! 

Think of it using the terminology smoke and mirror! For if you don‚Äôt serve a purpose they have no use for you! They just have no use for you.

You have to have something that they can use

I lost my entire life wishing to be someone else while still living my life! The life that I live now but as her

wishing for a life that I already had

If this wasn‚Äôt true then I would not have used real names, but instead I sorta posted it as a story like a movie script. 

For even though it only affects me! they are just to many names involved here, to many very big names at that! 

I guess a story like this would be best just to stay as such!

Just a story 

But one last thing the one that I wrote specifically just for Reddit! Being the one with Chloe! Something happened that never happened before! Just as finished one part of it, I was just messing around with it by putting in another time at the top of it from one of the other ones.

When I went to put the photo of her wearing a hoodie on it.

The photo just disappeared! It just vanished! Then popped back up, Out of every one of the others that I have written, that has never happened before the time on it when it happened ended in 27 being 12:27

So in the end I would know! Without knowing

With the world 

Never knowing

1jr2jb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/reacher/comments/1jr2jb9/season_3_filming_locations_review/,Season 3 filming locations review,"A bunch of people helped my find places that seemed like they could be found, but I was having no luck with. Thanks! 

There are 45 found locations https://maps.app.goo.gl/nzJKTbeKjCHDRZpQ8 , all are near Toronto or St John in Newfoundland.  I've mentioned in the location notes when other people had found the spot, except when they didn't want to be known.

Beck's mansion was made to look like it was on the ocean, they CGI's water from the Newfoundland coast and the mansion https://escarpmenthouse.com/ . All of the shots near the oceans edge were in Newfoundland. 

A couple interesting instances were scenes were filmed close together, but were not closely related in the story; the gas station where Reacher stalls for time getting coffee, the quarry where Neagley and Beck meet, and the scrap yard where the ATF shootout occurs, are all nearby one another https://www.google.com/maps/@44.0257911,-79.1460574,4765a,35y,342.56h,15.1t

The old warehouse where Quinn is holding Teresa, when he injects her with drugs, is in Cambridge, just down the street from where Villanueva and Duffy are chatting on the phone with Reacher.  https://www.google.com/maps/place/43%C2%B025'38.7%22N+80%C2%B019'15.4%22W/@43.4219359,-80.3151848,1282a,35y,348.61h,31.58

The hotel where Reacher and Duffy first meet is in Niagara Falls, right be the river, ""The Edgecliff Inn"".  The next furthest location within Ontario was Millbrook, where Reacher hides out in the laundromat, which in real like is a barber shop. Reacher emerges from some bushes across the street, but in real like there is a road there, which means the bushes were staged, just for Reacher to walk out of. The funny thing about that is there are actual hedges around there that they seemingly could have used.  

The Bizarre Bazar warehouse is just a filming studio in Hamilton, Aeon Bayfront Studios, and not an actual warehouse of any sort. The film company is lobbying the city of Hamilton to permit a larger studio there. 

What was supposed to be a rest stop is actually a public swimming pool the shore of Lake Ontario.  

Neagley's office is in a tower that's attached to the Metro Toronto Convention Center. 

The police impound is a place called ""Hudson Movers Toronto"". Based on the angled walls see in the interior, it can be deduced that the interior garage scene was at this location also, but in the next building over, and not directly attached to the entry where Reacher knocks the cop out cold. 

The shootout in the warehouse in episode 5, https://www.google.com/maps/place/Greif+Toronto/@43.7624388,-79.1701617,513a,35y,342.98h,14.69t the exterior is a business called Halltech Inc. while the interior is at a factory called 
Greif Toronto, about 8 kilometers to the west. The cool thing is that they show Reacher approaching a ""back entrance"" to the same warehouse that Duffy and Villanueva are trapped in with the Beck's security, in reality they did film the ""back entrance"" of that same building, though they show Reacher speed up to the entrance in the Audi, but looking at the location, it's clear that he couldn't have actually driven up to the warehouse from the direction.

Theresa's mom's is supposed to be in Boston IIRC, but is located on Jones Avenue. I think it's cool how good of a job they do finding location stand ins within the area of Toronto. Sometimes it's not convincing, but in this case I bought it. People who live in Boston would probably say it looked more Brooklyn, though. 

One of the most impressive finds from someone who I think wants to be anonymous, is the heavily CGI's scene where Reacher holds Quinn at gun point over an icy river below, was filmed at the edge of this quarry https://www.google.com/maps/place/43%C2%B032'45.6%22N+79%C2%B059'18.1%22W/@43.5422954,-79.9815572,1469a,35y,313.32h,25.26t , and you can appreciate all the work that the CGI department put in to make it look like something completely different from a quarry, with a fake raging river, and other scenery in the distance. 

There are some outdoor scenes which I have no plan to attempt locating, just due to the sheer difficulty it would represent, such as the old white house where Reacher kills Duke, or the  back roads leading to Beck's mansion that are featured in multiple scenes, as well as the barn where Quinn kills Kole. Maybe someone associated with the production can help out with that, if they ever come across this post.",3,1743737846.0,reacher,0,1.0,False

1jr2dyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1jr2dyu/my_gf_39f_say_that_i_37m_am_mentally_abusing_her/,My gf [39F] say that I [37M] am mentally abusing her,"I react very badly to this, because I really don't want to mentally abuse anyone. The moment she told me, I went straight into myself to figure out what went wrong and how I could improve. English is not my main language, so I wasn't sure what mentally abuse really means. She said the reason she feels I am mentally abusing her, is because she cannot say anything without being met with negativity on the topic.

We have had some hard weeks lately. I have been sick a lot, and some deaths in my family as well as some problems in my house I had to fix. Hard time in general, funds are going down, so in general our mood havent been the best. I have been trying to figure out how I am mentally abusing her, but after reading a lot about it and being open minded, I have came to conclusion that ""mentally abuse"" is not the right word here. Instead, I am ""Irritable, Neglectful and Passive-aggressive"". Another word that fit my behavior is ""belittling"".

I have lived alone all my life, and I am a massive introvert. I don't get any energy from social gathering. She knows this, and we have been talking a lot about this. I struggle for example in the mornings, before breakfast and coffee, she tend to have massive house projects or topics going on, and its too much for me those minutes. Here is usually where I have had my negative mood towards her. Sometimes I tell her that I need half an hour to calm down if the day have been long, like eating dinner and rest with just watching a 30 min episode of something to shut my brain off. Constantly there is something she needs or wants, and I try to be patient but sometimes I am not and I make a face or some ""sigh"" because of it.

However, she does this too. Which is why I am so confused right now by being called mentally abusive. Because one time I was in good mood, and was walking around the livingroom doing some measurement for some furnitures, and she completely snapped at me for doing that when she didnt want to do any work. I told her she doesnt have to do anything, I just have some motivation now and doing some measurements, but I ended up getting so much shit for it. She even at one point said I forced her to start this work during her relax time, which I absolutely didn't do. 

Anyway, after reading a lot about mentally abuse while being very open minded about I have to do some changes, I noticed a few things. A lot of the definitions of mentally abuse, is stuff I feel she does to me. Gaslighting for example. Or this silent punishment, Dismissing Feelings, Passive-Aggressive Behavior and a lot of other stuff.

I told her I read the definition about mental abuse, and read it to her. After reading it, she clearly felt targetted, even though I didnt target her at all, I just said I don't feel calling me mentally abusive is the right word here, while reading the definition. After reading she asked me ""do you think I do this""? She said it in a bit tricky question way, like I heard she was clearly offended by the definition (which I didnt make up). I tried to not put fuel on the fire and said ""since you ask, there is one thing I read that I might recognize you have done a few times in the past, which is being silent instead of talking about things, or if stuff doesnt go your way you say ""fine you are on your own"" and then leaves (this can be some small stuff like color on a wall or something).

Well, she got very angry and offended, and said ""This is absolutely 0% true"". I am now starting to realize that this might be the gaslighting? I dont' really know that word, but I read about it.

Our relationship have lasted for many years, and as an introvert living away from other people, I dont have many in my life. We play games online when we arent together, and in general it works fine. But I also want to have self respect and do the right thing. If I am mentally abusing her, I really need to work on myself. But the reason I write this, is because it felt so bad confronting her about what I read and she just straight out refuses the facst. In fact, she blames me now, saying I only say it to push the responsible over on her. I keep saying thats not the case, and I will be working on myself a lot here, but she just refuse to take it.

This is one situation out of many, and there is always two sides of a case. I feel recently I dont stand up for myself as much as I should, because I am scared of losing her. I am a very objective person here, but I also have feelings. And the feelings right now, is that I don't know how much I should stand on what I believe is right, because if I keep telling her that I am not the one thats mentally abusing, but she is, the relationship might end. There is no way in hell she will work on that. So now I have to sit and work on my mentally abusing behavior, while deep inside I feel I am the one being mentally abused. What is your impression? I tried being as honest as I could.

Tldr: My girlfriend say I mentally abuse her because I am sometimes negative when I respond to her topics. After reading about the meaning of ""mentally abuse"", I realised she might be the one that does it to me, and it feels bad I have to work for not being mentally abusive if she is the one that should work on it.",1,1743737358.0,relationshipadvice,1,1.0,False
1jr2d7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/ect/comments/1jr2d7w/finished_2_weeks_ago/,Finished 2 weeks ago,"So I‚Äôve been in hospital since the 2nd of January, and finished ECT two weeks ago.

The main thing is my memory, and I have a notes app on my phone and a note book I‚Äôve been using but I‚Äôm finding that I am an unreliable narrator. 
My Dad brought my car to me a couple days ago so I could drive to the gym, and my Dr has said I can‚Äôt drive. I‚Äôve developed a significant tremor and stutter, and I have forgotten sooooo much, and can‚Äôt remember new things. 
Some examples: I learnt to crochet and watched Buffy the vampire slayer and made a bunch of things, and now I can‚Äôt crochet and don‚Äôt remember anything about Buffy. I can‚Äôt remember my Dr or social workers name, or any of my nurses, despite having had them all for a long freaking time. My social worker and Dr told me their names yesterday and I‚Äôve forgotten again. I had a friend of my mum come and pick me up and take me out for coffee and I don‚Äôt remember it at all, and didn‚Äôt know it had happened until mum asked me how it was. I feel like these things are freaking dangerous, and it wasn‚Äôt explained that this could be an option (that I can remember anyway rip).

Context: We met her on reddit actually and it was a magical moment for me. I just randomly dm'ed her and said that her date idea was cute and hoped she finds someone. I really wasn't expecting anything from that Convo but then the chatter turned to exchanging of pics and the rest is history. She was my first gf. First to visit our house both in the province and metro. First person to give me flowers and surprise me on my graduation. First person I checked in with. First person that made me feel loved. I think those memories with her contributed to me not forgetting her that quickly.

I thought having a job would make things better because I have something to focus on but it made it even worse as I find myself questioning the decisions that I've made in my career. Those times I just long for someone's presence and it kept reminding me of her. I thought I was mentally stable with these sorts of stuff. But I guess I wasn't.

Previous Attempts: I invited her just this Jan to meet up because I was staying at her province for a vacay. Also to see if I really did get over her. Long story short, I wasn't. Seeing her go out the coffee shop and meet with her bf really hit me. I was questioning myself if it was the right thing to do. 

Now I face a lot of problems in my work and I can't help but miss her presence in my life. What could have been if we didn't break up at all. 

How should I deal with this situation? Attempts to distract myself using work and exercise only seem to be temporary. ",3,1743737228.0,adviceph,1,1.0,False

We had seem to really click out of out big friend group (iykyk). We also lived on the same dorm floor. There was an incident of her borrowing a shirt from me, and I forgot to pick it up from her room despite us seeing each other every day. X thought it was okay to constantly wear the shirt because I did not pick it up from her room. She wore it one day, came to my door (WEARING THE SHIRT), then asked if it was okay if she was wearing it. I was so shocked and I dint say anything. Because the shirt was $90, I told her how I felt she was disrespecting my things by continuously wearing it after the one-time borrow. Immediatly when I told her how I felt, she was very dismissive. She said, ""okay M"" in a groaning manner. I explained that it wasn't the value of the item but the principle. Fast forward a week later, she dropped me off some coffee in front of my door to serve as an apology. I tried to talk to her again as we went out for dinner just to express how I felt because I felt as she was not listening. She said, ""Why did you have to ruin the mood M?"". She never apologized from that incident. 

A month later, I was going through what I know now as a depressive episode. I am not a person who is vulnerable. I confided in her (on a surface level) and told her that I am in therapy on campus. A day later, we saw a guy who she is talking to romantically with his best friend. We are all engaging in conversation and I thought I hear someone call my name. I was mistaken. She then used me as the butt of the joke by saying ""you know shes crazy"". I couldn't believe it. I genuinely didn't pick up her rudness there, because I was giving her the benefit of the doubt. Months later we sign a lease together with another acquaintance, lets call her ""Q"".

 During our sophomore year, I was in therapy again because of major stress/ anxiety. Because there was a free event happening on campus, I told X & Q that I will have to miss it. X kept pressuring me to say why and eventually I did. As soon as I said I was going to stress therapy, X immediately said  ""its not my fault you are mentally ill"". I told her to get out of my room. She came back and apologized and I told her I was more disappointed than mad. I never forgave her for that. 

Another instance of direspecting my things. I bought a blowdryer and it was about $70 value. After I used it once, she asked to use it. *Me not being able to say no and not learning my lesson from the first time, I willingly gave it to her.* She also blew a fuse with my blowdryer when I was at work. Because the fuse box was in my room, she asked if I could reset her restroom plug when I came back. She never explicitly told me that she blew a fuse with my blowdryer, but she saw me visibly annoyed/ mad when I came home to ask for my blowdryer. She used it many times before this happened, btw. The last time she asked to use it, I told her ""no"". She proceeded to ask me if I was mad at her because I said no. Not even 15 minutes later, she left and bought the SAME EXACT blowdryer after using mine for 8 months. I then realized she was taking advantage of me not being able to say no...

\*Note: There is many other events that have happened between, but for times sake they were summed up to little digs masked as jokes.\*

Now in our senior year, I want to say I let things slide easily. In all the previous issues I brought up, I never explicitly told her what would bother me. The reason being I know if I tried to, I would be met with her being dismissive, and me feeling like I have to beg for X to hear me. Throughout the fall semester, our friendship went as usual, but I noticed that the digs would be more frequent and passed off as jokes. X, Q, and I have gotten closer in our friendship, and you could see it. With that closeness came higher disrespect. One night we were talking as usual and X ""jokingly"" said I had no common sense. I told her that was disrespectful and she fell silent. She said something along the lines of, ""it was not that disrespectful/ it was a joke"". I was so surprised with myself because when she says the little digs, my brain doesn't process it until 10 minutes later. I excused myself and went to bed. Later in the semester, right after Thanksgiving break, Q & X were in the common area talking and having playful banter. X said, "" don't play with me, I'm not like M"". This literally meant, don't say such things to me because I wont let it slide. That is the first moment my brain said something isn't right/ picked up on what she was saying. 

Fast forward to a week before Christmas, X invited me to see Wicked with her. I am dead broke at the moment and told her every time she talked about going out. I told her that I would love to see Wicked and will ask for money from my older sister to go. We planned to go on Tuesday after 3PM, because that's when I got off work. We both agreed and X said she'll buy the tickets. On Sunday before we are having a late night convo. I don't know if it was because I was tired, but I blocked out the convo for 3 minutes and said yes to something I misheard. Now on Tuesday, I get off work and I call X to see if she still wanted to go because she did not update me nor send the tickets. She told me on the phone "" I thought you bought the tickets"" and I was confused. I asked what happened and she said lets talk once you get in he apt. I come inside and I go to her room and ask again what happened. X thought I was going to buy the tickets like we discussed on Sunday night. On that night she asked if I could buy the tickets when my sister sent the money and I'd mistakenly said yes. She got mad at me for messing up the plan. I wanted to talk more about it but she said "" I dont want to have this conversation"".  I tried to elaborate that I gave her the time I was available and the date, and she said, ""After 3 PM is not even a real time"". My sister couldn't send me money, but I got my uncle to. By the time we looked for showings for that night, it was all sold out. I ended up buying both our tickets for that Friday (she did pay me back for her ticket). She gaslight me into thinking it was all my fault and it led me to trying to fix a problem that I never made. 

Fast-forward to the first week of the new year, I made my NY resolution to be more of who I was before college (outspoken, confident, etc) because I had felt like I truly lost myself. During the Thanksgiving break, I applied for three study abroad programs. I didn't tell a soul, except my sister who was proofreading my essays. One by one as I got into the program,s I told X & Q. They seemed happy upon the initial news for the 1st and 2nd program. By the third acceptance, I shared the news, and X told me congratulations but also asked, ""Did I sound this annoying when I got into my study abroad program"" (she went last summer). I looked at her like she was crazy. In my head, I was thinking, why would she say that right now. Later that week, I told X that I was going to fill up the second half of my summer with a potential internship. The first thing X said was ""why did you choose this summer to lock in, when its our last one together?"". Again, I presented good news to my friend and was met with bitter words. *For context, I decided to extend my graduation year, while Q & X are graduating on time.* In that moment, the little digs and blatent disrespect to me was clicking. All signs were screaming to disrespect in the highest degree. I still somehow overlooked it and some way and still let it slide. I keep telling myself that maybe she didn't mean it, or maybe I am just overthinking the situation. 

We went out with another friend for Valentine's Day to local bars around campus. X insisted we stop at our friend's apt. to use the restroom. (This is after a few drinks). When in the restroom, X made a command to me saying, ""Hand me a napkin"" when she washed her hands. My DUMB ASS PASSED HER THE FUCKING NAPKIN. I couldn't believe it. I felt like her fucking lap dog. And what's worse is that I ALLOWED THAT BEHAVIOR. For her, it was like she expected and KNEW that I was gonna pass her the napkin with no hesitation. I felt as if my last bit of self-respect crumbled away in that moment. The way she talks about how she treats men is the same treatment I experienced her say. I was floored, to say the least, and it kind of ruined my night. 

 I took the months of February and March to myself to focus on school and communicated to X that it was simply just that. And it genuinely was, but with my time alone from her (and Q), all those past experiences finally clicked in my brain as disrespect. I finally realized that throughout our whole friendship, X was disrespectful to me as a person and my things. I kept going back and recalling events, and I realized I had gaslit myself in those moments by overthinking. I never expressed how those interactions made me feel to X. It honestly pained me that someone I held dearly, as my closest college friend, hasn't really been a friend at all, just a mean, disrespectful person. I would be lying if I said that I didn't have good times and vibes when I was with her, but the disrespect was too much for me to continue in this friendship.

  
From that moment, I decided to cut her off. Last Friday, I knocked at her doo,r and in an HR way, I told her that I didn't want to be friends anymore. I told her that I felt disrespected throughout the friendship and that I felt like there was a distance between us upon me realising her actions. X was surprisingly receptive and apologized for making me feel that way in the friendship. She said she respected me as a woman, friend, and roommate. She asked if I could explain the moments of disrespect and I responded with I didn't want to explain. The reason being, I didn't bring it up with you at the moment it took place, so I don't think its fair to recall events over the years. X was surprised when I said years and even repeated it in a surprised tone. I ended with that I wished her the best and that this was hard for me to do. 

Just to end off, I know I have much personal work to do like getting a backbone and communicating how I feel in the moment. As of two weeks ago, I realized that friends are not supposed to make each other feel small or have them dim their light for their ego. No one should feel misriable after interacting with a true friend. I am partially at fault as to why I ended this friendship, and honestly this was a huge wake up call. 

  
**P.S. to those who will or are saying that ""I shouldn't have cut her off"" or ""should have given her a chance to mend things"", once someone falls in the habit of disrespecting you, they won't stop. That's it.** ",1,1743737099.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

Things have improved recently, and I‚Äôve started therapy, but my issues have impacted my healthy relationship of three years.

I moved abroad last year. Before I arrived, I began talking to a girl (let‚Äôs call her Girl A) about general stuff like visas‚Äînothing serious, just a bit of banter. We were both heading to the same university. After we got there, I started hanging out with her friend group (Group A) while settling in. I didn‚Äôt share full details of this with my girlfriend, though I mentioned some of the people I was spending time with. Eventually, I distanced myself from Girl A. There was no physical contact between us, just some lengthy conversations at times.

I had mentioned to Group A that I had a girlfriend, but I didn‚Äôt go into specifics. Eventually, I stopped spending time with them regularly.

Later, at a party, I spoke with another girl (Girl B from Group B). We were chatting in a corner, and I had already told her that I was in a relationship. I was also heavily drunk at this moment. Later, I found out someone from Group A had claimed I was kissing Girl B at that party. That wasn‚Äôt true. Afterward, I spoke to Girl B about this situation, we agreed we need to distance a bit and told my girlfriend, who was understandably upset and asked me to stop talking to Girl B. I agreed.

However, I still hung out with Group B. I met up with Girl B one-on-one for food or coffee a few times (maybe three), and a couple of people from her group visited my apartment once and she did too. I didn‚Äôt mention this to my girlfriend. The conversations were general‚Äîlife, relationships‚Äîand I did talk a bit about my own. There was some banter, but nothing flirtatious. That said, in hindsight, there were some gray areas, like some joking that may have crossed lines. I eventually stopped because I felt boundaries were being overstepped‚Äîby her and also by me.

A few months ago, I confessed everything to my girlfriend(partly due to guilt of lying and partly due to remorse), though not all at once. I told her bit by bit about both Girl A and Girl B. She was hurt each time I revealed more (which I fully understand), and I know I broke her trust. I‚Äôve also opened up to her about our past relationship problems‚Äîhow I used to feel judged when talking about my depression and trauma, how I was scared to tell her the truth, and how I avoided discussing things that hurt me. I realize now how wrong I was‚Äînot only for how I behaved around these other girls but also for not being honest in our relationship.

That said, I‚Äôve committed myself fully to my partner. I‚Äôve started opening up more and setting healthy boundaries. I‚Äôve talked to her about my experiences with sexual assault, bullying, and depression. I also have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, though it‚Äôs improved‚Äîand she‚Äôs seen some of my panic attacks.

I‚Äôm not trying to use my trauma as an excuse. I completely own up to my mistake/crime or whatever maybe be appropriate. I am a scum for doing this but I am looking to improve. I am deeply regretful and working hard to grow and improve‚Äîfor myself and as a partner. I‚Äôm in therapy now because I know I have unresolved trauma and unhealthy patterns that I need to fix.

1jr28wb,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1jr28wb/feeling_unsupported_unfulfilled_and_wrung_dry/,"Feeling unsupported, unfulfilled, and wrung dry","My husband (35m) and I (27F) have been together for 3 years, married for 6 months. Our whole relationship he hasn't had the best luck with jobs. He's gone months at a time two years in a row unemployed for one reason or another, and hops between jobs like it's a game. Meanwhile I've been building my career, and last year opened my own business. I'm doing pretty well, but not amazing, financially.

At his core he's a good person. We laugh a lot together despite the current situation, he's patient with me, and he cares about his community in selfless and admirable ways. When he's had a stable job in the past that paid well he has shown that he can carry his own weight, treat me to things once in a while, and it can be good. But it hasn't been good for over half of our relationship.

As a result of his job insecurity the past two years I've been footing all of our utility bills, groceries, and (exceptionally rare) dates. He does cover slightly less than half of rent but that's it. In December he also asked if we could get a puppy after I'd been requesting we rescue a second adult dog since my dog is getting very old and seemed lonely. He insisted on a puppy, saying it would be fun and that he would help with everything. I don't like having a puppy but this was the only way he would consider a second dog so I conceded. A few days after rescuing her he totally checked out and decided he didn't want her. By that point I was already attached and didn't want to give her back, so I have been the one taking care of her since the beginning.

Come to find out she is riddled with health and behavioral issues as a result of coming from an undisclosed abusive situation, and I've spent thousands on training and vet bills for her. Now that she's healthy and better trained he miraculously loves her, but still doesn't try to learn how to care for a large, active puppy so he's actually undone some of the hard work I've put in with the trainers.

Between paying for everything for the house and both dogs, I've racked up so much credit card debt it makes me sick, as well as squandered all of my savings and over half of the money I set aside to pay my business taxes this year. I'm also the only one with a car so any vet appointments, big errands, etc I am also paying for gas AND driving. He has a bike that he rides everywhere but he can't transport the dogs with it, so he can't take them to daycare or the vet. He doesn't even know where their vet is or when the appointments are even though we share a calendar that includes addresses. He'll offer to send me money and it's always only $15 or $20 but then will ask me to venmo him if he picks up some small thing from the store because otherwise he can't afford his vape bar.

He is working now, but turned down returning to a job he was previously laid off from with full time hours and good pay for one in the same field that's only 30 hours a week at $16/hr. Then he complains that every time he gets paid it's all gone within two hours trying to catch up from being laid off from October (literally the day we got married) until mid-January. Also in that time he tried to open a coffee stand and spent over $1000 getting stuff only to not even go through with it, so it's all sitting in our basement collecting dust.

On top of everything, I can't get him to even look at me romantically, let alone have sex or even cuddle and kiss. He doesn't know how I like my coffee even though I've reminded him a hundred times. I feel totally unwanted and unseen, but then if I take us out to dinner he just says ""I love going out with you"" as I pay $100 without him so much as pretending to reach for his wallet. Not that I think paying for the date should mean he has to have sex with me, I just mean the only time he expresses enjoying being around me is when I'm paying for a fancy dinner. He never tells me I'm beautiful even when I constantly tell him he's handsome.

The only time we spend time together is if I arrange it. If it were up to him he'd just ride his bike alone all day. He offers to go on bike rides together but I am physically disabled and cannot safely ride a bike. Whenever I suggest we try a new craft or watch a movie or show he's never interested.

I've just begun to expect I'll be paying 100% for anything that comes up and I've stopped keeping track or expecting him to one day pay me back because every time I bring it up- even gently- the conversation ends with me somehow apologizing to him and comforting him because he gets ashamed, and shuts down.

I'm feeling really taken advantage of. I'm exhausted being the only one taking care of this puppy, I've had to give up my own goals and desires because I'm paying for everything without an ounce of help, and I'm sad! I literally bought my own engagement ring and he almost lost it after I gave it to him to surprise me with someday!!! I feel so unsexy and undesirable when I'm literally in my prime, while simultaneously being milked for all I've got. It all feels so unfair.

I try so hard to encourage him lovingly to strive for better things and to try anything that calls to him. I never shame him for his job or how much money he makes. When I bring things up I just express frustration from my point of view, I never want to belittle him or point fingers and blame him even if deep down I want to.

 I've encouraged him to try new creative hobbies, which have really made him happy, but he's not interested in challenging himself when it comes to a career. He gets so paralyzed by fear of failure that it's hard for him to see past what's immediately ahead. He's also expressed feeling jealous of my career and financial situation but then when I tell him it's all because I made a five year plan he tunes out. He has no future plans or goals to work towards and doesn't want to make them. I want to encourage him but I can't make him want more for himself... It feels like I'm beating a dead horse sometimes.

We're on a waitlist for marriage counselling but I'm worried things will never change. I've even  recently found myself fantasizing about divorce which I'd rather leave as a very very last resort.

He was my only living family. My big brother, my protector, my closest friend. After we lost our mom when I was twelve and our dad bailed, it was always just the two of us. He raised me, basically. Cooked me dinner, walked me to school, taught me how to shave. The guy never asked for credit, never played the martyr. He just‚Ä¶ showed up. Every day. Without him, I felt like a hollowed-out version of myself. Like I‚Äôd been cracked open and everything good had leaked out.

I tried therapy. Didn‚Äôt click. Tried antidepressants. They numbed me to the point I couldn‚Äôt even cry. Then, one night, I saw a flyer posted in the corner of the window at a coffee shop I used to go to with him. Black background, white serif font, simple:

*We can‚Äôt bring back the dead‚Ä¶ but we can help you feel close to them again.*  
*Grief Support Circle ‚Äì Thursdays at 9pm.*  
*Wear red.*

It was weird. Red? Why? But I was raw. Desperate. Curious.

The church basement where they met was maybe two neighborhoods over from where I live. Run-down, clearly forgotten by time. I hesitated at the top of the stairs for a full minute before going in.

The light came from candles. Dozens of them. No electricity. The room smelled like melted wax and old wood and something earthy, like dried leaves.

About twenty people sat in a circle on folding chairs. All of them were wearing red in some form‚Äîscarves, shawls, even a full red cloak on one woman with eyes like cloudy glass. I wore a red hoodie. No one batted an eye.

The circle leader introduced herself as Marla. She looked like a librarian or a kindergarten teacher‚Äîgraying hair tied back, calm voice, gentle eyes. She thanked me for being brave enough to come.

Then she asked if I wanted to share.

I didn‚Äôt plan to speak. But something about the room‚Äîthe silence, the stillness, the soft flickering light, the way everyone actually seemed to¬†*listen*‚Äîit broke something loose in me. I started talking about my brother. Our stupid inside jokes. How he used to let me stay up and watch horror movies with him when I was too young. How he smelled like peppermint and clean laundry. How he held my hand at our mom‚Äôs funeral and whispered to me that I still had him. That I always would

I hadn‚Äôt told anyone that before. Not even my partner. I cried harder than I‚Äôd cried since the day I lost him.

And after the tears dried, I felt‚Ä¶ lighter. Not healed. Not okay. But somehow, less alone.

The meeting ended with a chant. Everyone stood, held hands, and hummed‚Äînot a tune, exactly, but something low and vibrating. A single word repeated again and again: ‚ÄúVelushta.‚Äù No one explained what it meant.

When it was over, I thanked Marla. She just touched my shoulder and said that I was seen tonight.

It was strange. A little culty, sure. But it helped.

So I went back the next week.

The second meeting was smaller. Only ten of us this time. Still candlelit. Still wordless at first. Still that hum of calm like being in the eye of a storm.

A guy named Leo shared about his son who‚Äôd died in a car crash. He placed a small, tattered stuffed bear in the center of the circle. Marla nodded solemnly and said offerings help the departed find us.

That‚Äôs when I noticed them‚Äîitems scattered in the middle of the circle. Old toys. Wedding rings. Worn-out sneakers. A lock of hair tied with string. At first glance, it just looked like junk.

Then I realized‚Ä¶ every item belonged to someone dead.

That week, I brought a photo of my brother. Us at the beach when I was maybe five. I left it in the circle without saying anything. No one questioned it. Marla just nodded.

And that night, I dreamed of him.

Not the usual hazy memory replay I‚Äôd been having. It was vivid. He sat on the edge of my bed, smiling at me, eyes soft, hair messy. He said he was still here. I just needed to listen better.

I woke up sobbing. But also‚Ä¶ grateful.

I told myself that‚Äôs what group therapy is like, right? You open up, you process, you start to heal. The rituals, the red clothes, the chanting‚Äîit was all just framing. Symbolic. Nothing supernatural. Just grief dressed up with structure.

Right?

It was my fifth meeting when the cracks started to show.

We had a newcomer‚Äîa woman maybe in her forties, looking completely shattered. Makeup smeared, hands shaking, red scarf bunched around her neck like a noose. She sat down, whispered her name‚ÄîJessa‚Äîand said her daughter had died of sepsis. Only six years old.

She didn‚Äôt cry. Just stared at the floor like it might swallow her.

When the circle ended, Jessa started gasping. Shaking. Panic attack. Marla calmly approached her, knelt, and placed a small Herkimer diamond on her chest.

Instant silence. Jessa slumped in her chair. Eyes closed. Breathing deep. Everyone else seemed completely unfazed. Me? I wanted to bolt. But I didn‚Äôt. Because I was still sleeping better. Still dreaming of my brother. Still waking up to the sound of his voice whispering my name from deep inside my skull. And that didn‚Äôt scare me. It comforted me.

Until the sixth meeting.

I brought my brother‚Äôs hoodie with me that night.

I‚Äôd been saving it. It still smelled like him‚Äîfaintly‚Äîafter all this time. I kept it in a sealed plastic bag at the back of my closet like it was a holy relic. I wasn‚Äôt even sure why I brought it. Maybe I just wanted to see him more clearly in my dreams. Maybe I wanted him to¬†*talk*¬†to me again, like he had that first night.

I left it in the center of the circle like everyone else did. Marla gave me that same calm, approving nod. The chanting that night was louder. Longer. There was something different about it. The rhythm pulsed, like a heartbeat. Everyone‚Äôs voices were deeper. Not in pitch, but in weight, like they were singing from somewhere below ground.

Then it happened.

The air dropped ten degrees in a blink. I could see my own fogged breath rise into the candlelight. The flames flickered, hissed‚Ä¶ then died, one by one, as if something was walking through the center of the circle snuffing out each one individually.

Darkness swallowed the room. It was silent for a moment. No one moved. I heard someone quietly weeping.

Then‚Äîfootsteps. Slow. Wet. Uneven. Like bare feet slapping on a stone floor. I couldn‚Äôt see anything, but I could feel it. The thing that entered the circle wasn‚Äôt human. It felt like gravity bent slightly around it.

The smell came first. Like rotting meat mixed with burned rubber and bile. Then the voice.

It wasn‚Äôt¬†*spoken*. It was inside my head.

‚ÄúYou said always‚Ä¶‚Äù

And suddenly I was ten again, crouched behind the couch at our mom‚Äôs funeral, whispering to my brother that I‚Äôd never leave him. That he‚Äôd always have me.

That moment had been private. Sacred. No one else was there. No one could‚Äôve known. But the voice repeated it. My voice.¬†*From then*. Over and over, like a recording dragged across broken glass.

The candles sputtered back to life. And it was standing there. Tall. Wearing my brother‚Äôs hoodie. But the thing inside it wasn‚Äôt him.

Its limbs were too long. Its skin looked like wax pulled over bones. The hoodie hung wrong, stretched too tight across a chest that rose and fell in jerky, irregular bursts. Its mouth was open, too wide, like rubber stretched to tearing. Its eyes‚Äîor what should‚Äôve been eyes‚Äîwere tiny black pits that¬†*oozed*. Thick, greenish bile dripped from them onto the floor.

It stepped forward. I couldn‚Äôt move. I couldn‚Äôt scream. All I could do was¬†*stare*¬†as it tilted its head toward me.

‚ÄúAlways,‚Äù it whispered again in my voice.

And that snapped something loose in me.

I bolted.

The others stood as one. Their faces blank. Their mouths moving silently. Their arms reached for me‚Äîbut I was near the door. I shoved past them, hit the stairs, and didn‚Äôt stop running until I was in my car with the engine screaming and the gas pedal slammed to the floor.

I didn‚Äôt look back.

That was five nights ago. I haven‚Äôt left my apartment since. I keep every light on. I‚Äôve blocked the windows. I don‚Äôt sleep more than an hour at a time.

The first night, I told myself I imagined it. That it was a grief-induced hallucination. The second night, I found the hoodie folded neatly at the foot of my bed. It was still wet. It still reeked. The third night, I heard someone breathing just outside my front door. Soft, deliberate breaths. Like they were waiting for me to open it. The fourth night, my phone played a voice memo I didn‚Äôt record. It was me, crying, whispering, don‚Äôt leave me. Please don‚Äôt leave me. Except it wasn‚Äôt from any moment I remember.

And last night? Last night I woke up at 3:33 AM.

The lights were off. All of them. My phone was dead. My laptop was unplugged. Even the glow from the router was gone.¬†

But candles were lit. Dozens of them arranged in a circle. And in the middle of the room, right where my coffee table used to be, someone had written a word on the hardwood floor in a dark, wet smear:¬†

RETURN.

I don‚Äôt know if it was a message or a command.

But I know this:

Someone‚Äîor¬†*something*‚Äîwants me back.

Not sure where else to post this.

Basically at a standstill crossroad / quarter life crisis. I‚Äôm a 30 year old male working a dead end job as a cashier at a gas station, been here for 4 years. I make good money for what i do. I do nothing and make 19$ an hour. Straight cashing people out. Don‚Äôt even have our own coffee and no hot / cold food. Super easy. 

I make 2k a month. My bills and everything i pay come out to about 1300 a month. I live with my dad. 700$ left over is obviously not nearly enough to move out and get my own place.

Small background that led me to this point.
Got into drugs heavy right when i graduated high school. Parents never pushed me to go to college or anything. Kept dismissing it as I‚Äôll just get a job and work my way up. They didn‚Äôt care much. Hung out with my ‚Äògood friends‚Äô to them, but they didn‚Äôt know we were fucking up.

Led me to IV heroin/cocaine for a couple years. Got sober at 22 in 2016. Went to jail and took drug court and completed and had my charges reduced. I enrolled in college finally at 24? To satisfy graduating (had to get a job or college to graduate drug court. Was in halfway houses / supportive living at the time; didn‚Äôt want a job yet cuz then I‚Äôd have to pay out of pocket to stay in supportive living , and wouldn‚Äôt even make enough to get my own place) 

Graduated drug court in fall 2018. Didn‚Äôt plan to graduate college but did in covid 2021/2022. Got human services cuz i wanted to do drug counseling (as most recovering addicts do at first lol). Had a couple entry jobs that didn‚Äôt require a degree before i graduated . Quit them and started gas station around time i was graduating college. After getting off DSS, moved with my girlfriend and her parents. After we broke up i moved back to my dads. Had a baby with a different girl. Baby mom and i broke up months after son was born.

Been getting raises every year at gas station and felt like didn‚Äôt want to leave because the money is good for what i do. Started at 14$ in 2021 now im at 19$. Guess it‚Äôs all adjusted for inflation.

So yeah, not sure what i want to do now. My degree would literally pay what I‚Äôm already making so that‚Äôs the only reason why i haven‚Äôt returned back to the addiction / mental health field. 

I have no other interests but know i want to make significantly more money to change my lifestyle. I have no skills. I feel like im wasting my time and life right now working a dead end job. 

My new love is day trading , but im on the fence of going back to school for finance , or just biting the bullet and learning a trade . 

I‚Äôve never been a handy man, i don‚Äôt even know which trade to go for if i joined the union. I have zero experience with any trades and dont want to pick something I‚Äôd hate or regret or would be too hard. But i know i need to change my lifestyle.

One of the biggest quotes from recovery that stuck with me and i feel like applies to my situation right now is, if you want something you‚Äôve never got, you have to do things you‚Äôve never done. And i feel like that applies hard right now. I have to suck it up and do something I‚Äôve never done to get something I‚Äôve never had.

I‚Äôve crunched the numbers a million times. I‚Äôd basically need / want to make another 1-2k a month to be able to afford to move out. But where do i start to get that kind of money? Obviously keeping an open mind to any and all answers and open to discussion. If i did join a union, i know i want to do something that wont destroy my body in the long run (concrete / flooring, construction, carpentry).
I‚Äôm almost considering electrician? But i have no fucking clue. 

Basically mainly would like to get a place for me and my girlfriend (she has 2 kids ; 10 & 12) and my son when it‚Äôs my turn to have him. 

Thanks to all who read this. And if it doesn‚Äôt belong here, also open to people pointing me to the correct subreddit . Thank you!

1jr1zkh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1jr1zkh/family_member_told_me_a_wild_story_and_now_im/,Family member told me a wild story and now I'm looking for resources,"I do not meditate and only have a passing understanding of it. This understanding is enough to the point where I respect the practice. However, my knowledge on the topic is very shallow. Hopefully you guys can point me in the right direction if I'm off base. I'm a skeptical materialist type of person and I'm very much NOT into the woo stuff. After looking around this subreddit I got the impression you guys are pretty grounded (for lack of a better term) so I feel like you guys would not only know about this but would also know where I'm coming from. Also, I rarely ever make posts on reddit and I'm having issues with formatting, hopefully it's not too illegible!

My dad (55yo) and I had a pretty heavy conversation today. Most of which isn't going to be mentioned here. One of the many tangents he went on were these experiences he had when he was a young teenager (around 12 or 14). He divulged a lot of information about himself and his youth I never knew. He told me he used to ""meditate"" and he was thinking of getting back into it. Meditate is in quotations because he said he only thinks of it meditation in hindsight and didn't call it that when did it. However when he describes it, it doesn't sound like meditation to me but like I said I only have a surface level understanding of the topic.

He told me he used to sleep on the screened in porch of their house (I have no clue why). When it got cold, instead of simply laying down and going to sleep he would sit up in a rocker with the blankets with a cigarette in one hand (yeah smoking at 14) and a cup of coffee in the other (not even decaf, my dad's a madman and I have no idea how he functions) and he would focus on a spot. At this point in the story I'm thinking yeah, totally meditation right on! Then he elaborates and that's when it gets wacky.

He stopped himself and told me the thing he would focus on was an eye, but ""not an eye more like a circle but it was an eye"". he then told me he remembers freaking out when he saw it ""on that movie y'all watched when y'all were little"" (I found out later this movie was lord of the rings, he basically told me he would stare into the fucking eye of Sauron lol. Obviously he didn't call it that, the man does not read books.) He then told me he would focus on that until he would get a body feeling and then he could see the area around him as if it was daytime and he would turn around and see himself sitting in the rocking chair with his eyes open.

After this he moved on saying he used to do it all the time until he was around 16 or 17. Unfortunately, you can't interrupt this man when he's talking, and honestly the main topic of conversation was a little too serious which kept us from exploring the this wild shit he threw at me. I had so many questions to ask about this but the only one I could get out was if he's ever looked into meditation and his experiences. The main answer is no and he doesn't bring it up to people because we're in the south and the last thing he wants to hear is someone talking about ""Jesus and shit"". So I've now taken it upon myself to look into because he isn't and doesn't seem as curious about it as I would be if I was in his shoes.

Sorry for the wall of text..... So, are out of body experiences and/or hallucinations a common reported experience with meditation?

TL:DR Dad told me a wild story about his ""mediation"" and now I'm looking for resources that discuss various methods of meditation and/or extreme experiences of deep meditation. Maybe even examples of people that can reach a deep meditative state easily?

If I'm asking the wrong kind of questions or if I'm way off please let me know!

Side note: I had thought maybe he was having hypnagogia as I have stumbled into nice and vivid experiences with that (nothing like his) but he says he was wide awake so that ruined that hypothesis

Sophia had found the work tedious, though being able to stop time to catch up on work was nice. She has made use of several resources from the local time being Karm, along with several visits from Tempora. She's even spent time with her mother, though unintended, her mother was relentless.*

*Now, she sat at her desk. She looks out the window to see her younger self and Techney return from their trip to the ruins in the Pine Isles. Her time here is almost up. She gather's her notes and almost as if on cue, Tempora appeared.*

Tempora: You ready?

Sophia: Yeah, anything else I can get back to later.

Tempora: Very well then.

*They slipped through not only time, but to another universe, completely separate from the one they were just in.* 

Sophia: So, where to this time?

Tempora: To see an old friend or two.

Sophia: Is that so?

*The space was small compared to other beings' realms. No bigger than a house really, but Osmian didn't need much to do their work. They were diligent, putting much thought into every magical gift they gave. Their latest one though had taken since the beginning of time to make, getting it blessed by the divine creator themself. Their guests would be here soon, they just had to put the finishing touches on.* 

Tempora: Oz, you here?

Osmian: Hm? Oh, right on time, hehe. This your apprentice?

Sophia: Hello, well uhm... sorta, it's...

Osmian: No worries young one, I know who you are. I can see it in your eyes.

Sophia: What? But...

Osmian: I'm kidding, Tempora told me she'd be bringing you. It's also my duty to gift all magic, even to ascending gods.

Sophia: Wait... Tempora, you mean...

Tempora: Yes, you're ready. It'll be unbelievably long, but it is vital.

Sophia: ... will I be able to say goodbye?

Osmian: Tempi, stop being so cruel to yourself and just tell her. Yes, you're aloud breaks dear. Honestly Tempi, is so hard to be straight forward?

Tempora: I gotta have my fun somehow.

*Osmian grabs something off the table and hands it to Sophia.*

Osmian: Here, it's the last divine essence I'll ever make. Time can be a... fickle thing.

Sophia: Last? You mean you've made others?

Osmian: Oh yes. Yours, Rakis, Artan, and uh... one more...

Sophia: The ones that popped up and weren't directly made by the great creator. Did... did they ascend like me?

Osmian: More or less. They all were born and I gave them their power. Though... the one uh... 

Tempora: Oz, say no more. She'll learn one day.

Sophia: ... it was the Omega, right?

Tempora: Yes.

Osmian: ... I can't say much but... after you absorb that... you'll know them when you see them. They ascended long ago though... they were unaware, going off of their mortal emotions...

Tempora: It's a hard subject for us. Even those given sight like Oz here from the creator don't know anything past the end.

Sophia: But... can you, I mean... can't I go and see when-

Tempora: It's locked, I can't go past that point.

Explaination :- 

This login.php file handles user authentication using a simple form. It validates user credentials and starts a session upon successful login. If the login fails, an error message is displayed. The form is styled with a modern, glassy UI.
Session Management ‚Äì Uses PHP sessions to track logged-in users.
Dummy Authentication ‚Äì Hardcoded username/password for testing (testuser1/1234)(testuser2/1234).
Error Handling ‚Äì Displays an error message for incorrect credentials.
Modern UI ‚Äì Uses backdrop-filter for a frosted glass effect with a dark-themed background.
Secure Input Fields ‚Äì Uses required attributes to ensure all fields are filled before submission.
Breakdown of Components:
1.	Session Handling & Authentication:
o	Starts a PHP session (session_start()) if not already started.
o	Checks if the request method is POST (form submission).
o	Compares the entered credentials with hardcoded values (testuser / 1234).
o	If valid, stores the username in $_SESSION['username'] and redirects to products.php.
2.	Background Styling:
o	Dark-themed abstract digital grid background.
o	Semi-transparent overlay (body::before) for improved readability.
3.	Login Form Structure:
o	Wrapped in .login-container with blur effects for a stylish UI.
o	Input fields for username and password, each with custom styling.
o	A ""Login"" button with hover and scaling effects.

1) finished a video project. This allowed me to delete all the extra clips I knew for sure I would never use again.

2) found shelf supports that fit my bookcase so I could put another shelf in it. This allowed me to clear the surface of my coffee table (covered in books). Plus I don't have a loose shelf leaning against the wall anymore.

3) used up a bunch of black bananas in the freezer to make banana bread. I plan to use up the rest in a double batch soon. I want them gone!

4) am now sewing a table runner. It's almost done! This created more space in my bag of fabrics. 

I still have piles of paperwork and books all over my desk. I'm sort of dreading it, but I know I'll enjoy it once I get going. Getting started is the hardest part for me.

Book#1: they have a one night stand. The guy hasn't had sex in a while finishes early, then gets an important work call and leaves. (He is rich and has a big business with his sister.) she is left unsatisfied sitting on her coffee table. Long story short she's now pregnant, she tells the guy. he shows up at her apartment with a team of lawyers trying to get her to sign over her rights (he has issues cause his dad kept getting women pregnant, and the moms didn't stick around, dad paid them.) She calls her lawyer who shows up and laughs in their faces when they offer the pregnant women money. Long story short she comes from a really rich family, she just wants to support her self. In fact the guy and the girls families do not like each other. The guys sister hires the girl to work at their company. The girl is in like design or maketing. The product she gets to work on is a remote-controlled robot. The guy designed it for his young kid brother who is sick. 

That is everything I can remember. 

There is another book in the series about the sister. She is a strong businesswoman and goes to Vegas for I want to say a wedding. There she ends of marrying this businessman who she's trying to make a business deal with. She wakes up to the marriage license stuck to her ass. They both argue about who is going to take the marriage license, to then contact their lawyer to get an annulment. one of them takes a shower and the other steals it off the bathroom counter. I also remember the guy has a thing about locking doors, because when he was a kid, he didn't lock the door and his whole family was like murdered. I know they stay married and at some point, try a relationship. 

Another book in the series, takes the nanny from one of the previous books, and shes the main character. The family give her a vacation to Europe to see the northern lights (aurora borealis) which she has always wanted to see. On her flight she is forced to sit next to the guy who left her at the alter years ago. I belive hes Scottish. He ends up kinda following her on her trip trying to figure out what happened. Because they are both mad at the other and neither really understands why the other has a right to be mad. What happened was I think his family sabotaged his wedding to her, because she wasn't ""rich and important"".

Like the streets are all the same, the buildings (most of them) are the same, but something feels off like you walked into the wrong timeline.



I visited for the first time in years recently, and it's incredible how much has changed and yet still doesn't feel like it's progressed from the past. The crumbling gas station is now a trendy coffee shop, but the weirdly depressing mall continues to be half-empty. None of the new developments makes any sense, and half of the crap that made the place ""interesting"" is gone. But somehow, that one pothole of 2013 is still there.



And the people? Either they all departed, or they've become slightly warped versions of themselves‚Äîsuch as NPCs who've had their lines revoiced. Ran into an old friend I hadn't seen in ages, and we spent this awkward five-minute ""what have you been up to?"" exchange before there was nothing left to discuss. And meanwhile, the local Facebook group is engaged in a cold war regarding whether the new Dollar General constitutes ""growth"" or ""gentrification."".



I don't know, man. Maybe I altered more than the town itself did. Or maybe some towns just exist in this weird suspended state where time gets slower but also moves too fast.

Japan uses the same plug outlet as the US, and the part of Japan I am in is 60Hz like the US, however the voltage is lower (100V vs 120V)

Given it's a gift I don't want to turn it down (and it would also obviously be great to have a free blender) but I was to be sure it's fine to use in Japan.

The specs on her blender (I haven't opened the box of the new one,  in case I need to return it) don't give a voltage range (just specify 120V with no wiggle room) and the photos of the bottom of Japanese nutribullets specific 100V 50Hz/60Hz compatible. Nutibullet's website and PDFs for the model in question don't have technical information about the voltage range the appliance has been engineered for, and predictably just give a big warning not to use in a region with a different electrical standard under any circumstances.

Intuitively, stepping down in voltage should be safe in my mind as it should mean they are just operating at a lower power. However, I also know - from having experience with coffee grinders - that appliances with motors often have to be carefully calibrated, especially when dealing with resistive torques, so being under powered may be an issue if some parts of the electronics are expecting the motor to be delivering more power than it actually is.

Does anyone have any experience of taking a nutribullet blender from the USA to Japan, (or is someone a blender/electronics engineer) who can help advise?",1,1743735284.0,NutriBullet,0,1.0,False

I've tried gratitude journaling many times, but I usually drop off after a few days. I'm an English teacher with a health background and some modest coding skills, and I recently built something that might help people like me stick with a gratitude practice more constistently.

[GratiSphere](https://preview.redd.it/33rfbxbbhqse1.png?width=1014&format=png&auto=webp&s=77ce200e5a1c87bfb8be18b8ffdd3c7dc3df3d62)

It's called **GratiSphere** ‚Äî a gratitude tracker that turns your entries into a **dynamic word cloud**. The more you write, the more your cloud grows. Words you mention often ‚Äî like *family*, *friends*, or *coffee* ‚Äî appear larger, giving you a visual reminder of what really matters to you.

It also tracks your gratitude streaks, kind of like Wordle, and lets you share your progress if you want.

It‚Äôs completely free to use.  
You can register via email (with validation) or Google login.  
Or try it out first with this test account:

[https://wholenessforward.com](https://wholenessforward.com)  
Username: test  
Password: test

I'd love your feedback:

* Would you (or someone you know) use this? Why or why not?
* What do you think of the design and layout of the word cloud?
* Was the overall experience intuitive and easy to navigate?

This is part of a larger project called *Wholeness Forward*, but I‚Äôm considering turning GratiSphere into a standalone app if it resonates with people.

Thanks in advance for your thoughts ‚Äî I really appreciate you taking the time to read this and hope it can provide some meaningful value to you.",2,1743735174.0,gratitude,0,1.0,False

So one question is where can I find a good tattoo artist who is English friendly? I really want to get a small tattoo as like a souvenir for my first time travelling to Japan. I‚Äôm into really cartoony styles and was thinking on getting a Maneki Neko or Daruma Doll. 

Another is good clothing stores for a woman who size is around 14 AU. I‚Äôm really into cute alt fashion.

Any anime figurine stores that you would recommend? 

Oh also cafe or restaurant recommendations I really love food and coffee.

Android Auto 14.0 Hints at a Major Shift!,"The recent buzz around Android Auto 14.0 hints at a significant evolution in how we interact with our vehicles, especially with the potential arrival of Google Gemini. As someone who‚Äôs always on the lookout for ways to enhance the driving experience, the integration of advanced AI like Gemini could be a game changer. Imagine having a personal assistant that not only understands your preferences but also adapts to your driving habits in real-time!

With Gemini, the potential for seamless voice commands and smarter navigation is incredibly exciting. Think about it: no more fumbling with your phone or trying to decipher complicated menus while you‚Äôre on the road. Instead, you could just ask your car to find the fastest route or even suggest a great coffee shop based on your usual stops. This kind of intuitive technology could really transform our commutes into more enjoyable experiences.

Moreover, the safety implications are significant. Enhanced AI could help reduce distractions by allowing drivers to control functions through simple voice interactions. This means keeping your eyes on the road while still accessing all the features that modern cars offer.

As we wait for this update, it feels like we‚Äôre on the brink of a tech revolution in our vehicles. The thought of having a smart, responsive system like Gemini integrated into our cars is thrilling. It could redefine what we expect from our in-car experience and set a new standard for automotive technology. What are your thoughts?

All the evidence I have found so far is my laptop and a post it note in my handwriting; only it seems I wrote it in a panic or a state of delirium. Letters are cursive variants but upside down for some reason; nevertheless, from what I could tell, it said, ""The Whispers in the Stack, See. Know. Become.‚Äù If anyone can help me find out who or what did this to me.

**First Entry: The Night Shift**

I never expected much from a night security job‚Äîjust a paycheck to keep the lights on. The Eldridge Archive sits on the edge of town, a squat, weathered building stuffed with historical records no one bothers to read anymore. It‚Äôs the kind of place that feels like it‚Äôs waiting to be forgotten, its narrow halls and towering shelves bathed in the faint hum of flickering fluorescents. The air smells of moldy paper and something sharp, like old ink gone sour. I took the gig because my wife, Sarah, works days at the hospital, and we‚Äôve got a mortgage breathing down our necks. It‚Äôs dull work: walk the perimeter, check the locks, and make sure nothing‚Äôs out of place. Simple. My third night on the job, though, something shifted. I was in the east wing‚Äîthe oldest part of the archive, where the shadows cling a little too long and the air turns cold enough to prickle your skin. A sound stopped me mid-step: a whisper, so soft I thought it was a draft sneaking through the walls. I held my breath, listening. There it was again‚Äîa faint murmur, like someone reading just beyond the shelves. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I called, my voice swallowed by the silence. The only reply was the groan of the floorboards settling. I shook it off. Old buildings creak, right? But as I turned to move on, my flashlight caught something‚Äîa small, leather-bound book lying on the floor, half-tucked under a shelf. It hadn‚Äôt been there before; I‚Äôd swear to it. The cover was cracked with age, and inside, the title page read, Logbook, 1937. I flipped through it‚Äîstandard stuff about archive upkeep‚Äîuntil one line snagged my attention: ‚ÄúThe watcher in the margins grows restless.‚Äù It sounded like a prank, some bored clerk‚Äôs scribble. I pocketed it anyway, a weird itch of curiosity tugging at me. When I got home that morning, I slept fine. But that whisper‚Äîit stuck with me, a quiet echo I couldn‚Äôt shake.

**Second Entry: \~The Unraveling\~**

A week in, and the whispers weren‚Äôt just background noise anymore. They followed me through the stacks, faint but persistent, like a conversation I was never meant to hear. I started carrying a recorder, hoping to catch something concrete, but all I got was static laced with the building‚Äôs creaks. Sarah noticed the change first. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not sleeping,‚Äù she said one morning, sliding a coffee mug across the counter. Her eyes were tired and worried. ‚ÄúThis job‚Äôs getting to you.‚Äù She wasn‚Äôt wrong‚ÄîI felt like I was running on fumes‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt just exhaustion. The archive was wrong somehow. One night, I found a map on a reading table in the main hall. It wasn‚Äôt there an hour before. The paper was brittle, the ink faded, but it showed a place called Eldritch Hollow‚Äîa town I‚Äôd never heard of, its streets coiling into impossible knots. I folded it up, shelved it, and moved on. When I checked later, it was gone. Then there was the diary: a thin, warped volume I pulled from a box dated October 31, 2025‚Äîthree years from now. The handwriting was jagged, ranting about a ‚Äúgreat awakening‚Äù and ‚Äúeyes that see through time.‚Äù My pulse hammered as I read it. The next night, I went back to check it again. The pages were blank. Home wasn‚Äôt much better. Sarah and I started fighting‚Äîabout bills, about how I‚Äôd stare through her like she wasn‚Äôt there. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not yourself,‚Äù she snapped one evening, her voice cracking. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt even know you anymore.‚Äù I wanted to tell her about the whispers, the documents, but the words stuck in my throat. She‚Äôd think I was losing it. Maybe I was. Then the dreams started. Vast, unblinking eyes hovering in an endless void, watching me. They peeled me apart, layer by layer, until I woke gasping, drenched in sweat. The whispers lingered, louder now, threading through my skull.

**Final Entry: \~\~The Descent\~\~**

I couldn‚Äôt keep going like this. The whispers had teeth now, sharp little words I could almost grasp‚Äî‚ÄúSee. Know. Become.‚Äù They didn‚Äôt stop at the archive anymore; they trailed me home, buzzing in my ears even in daylight. Sleep was a lost cause‚ÄîI‚Äôd close my eyes and see those endless eyes staring back. My hands wouldn‚Äôt stop shaking, and food turned to ash in my mouth. Sarah left a note one morning: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm staying with my sister. I can‚Äôt do this anymore.‚Äù The house felt emptier without her, but I couldn‚Äôt muster the energy to care. I had to end it. On my last shift, I went straight for the restricted section‚Äîa locked wing I‚Äôd never bothered with before. The key trembled in my hand as I opened the door. Inside, the air was heavy, pressing down like wet cloth, and the shelves were packed with strange, leathery books that seemed to hum under my touch. The whispers exploded, a chorus of overlapping voices clawing at my brain. At the end of the aisle stood a pedestal, an open book on it. The pages writhed with symbols that twisted and pulsed, glowing a sickly green. I couldn‚Äôt look away. Something moved behind me‚Äîa blur, like ink bleeding across paper. I spun around, but the aisle was empty, the shadows bending in ways that defied reason. My chest tightened, breath coming in ragged bursts. I ran, the whispers shrieking after me, my boots pounding the floor until I stumbled out the front doors and into my car. I didn‚Äôt stop driving until dawn. I quit that morning, sending an email from a coffee shop because I couldn‚Äôt face going back. I told myself it was over. But it‚Äôs not. Sitting here in my living room, the lights off and the silence thick, I still hear them‚Äîthe whispers. They‚Äôre soft, barely there, but they dig into me. Sometimes, in the dark, I catch a flicker in the corner of my eye‚Äîa smear of shadow that doesn‚Äôt belong. I tell myself it‚Äôs nothing, that I‚Äôm just tired. But I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs real anymore. Maybe I never did.

Intrepid Adventurers to join Oreloc‚Äôs newest adventuring guild! Are you a skilled warrior, mage, or rogue? Do you thirst for gold and glory? Then we want you! Tryouts this Saturday. NO BARDS.*

¬†

I nailed that add, and it only took two hours to write. It‚Äôs funny how the words just flow out of you when you know you‚Äôre doing something right. My parents thought this was a stupid idea. Why would anyone want to join my guild when they could drive into Castleton and sign up with one of the major guilds and make some serious questing money? They didn‚Äôt get it. Everyone knew that the big boys in the city started off small, just like I was doing. Give it a couple of years, I said, and I‚Äôll be set up in a nice cushy office, surrounded by treasure. Maybe I‚Äôd even get my name in the paper. I had big dreams, but first I needed a team.

I got my sister, Polk, to draw a picture of a half-orc (me, obviously), ripping the head off a goblin and spewing his guts all over the ground. I had to give her five gold pieces, and even then, needed to go back and add some extra blood‚Äîshe never does enough‚Äîbut when it was done, I had the perfect flyer. I used my dad‚Äôs Arcane Personal Scriptor to print off thirty copies and hung them all over town. Oreloc‚Äôs a suburb of Castleton and there are plenty of people around‚Äîorcs, fairies, gnomes, even a few dwarves‚Äîso I knew I‚Äôd get a good turnout. The elves live up in the Heights, where the mansions are, and I didn‚Äôt expect any of them to show up, but I didn‚Äôt need them anyway. An elf on the team would only make things more annoying.

Saturday morning came, and I was a wreck. I‚Äôd claimed the basement rumpus room as my tryout space and pushed all the furniture against the wall. The carpet was nailed down so there wasn‚Äôt much I could do about that, but I‚Äôd be sure no one got any blood anywhere. By nine o‚Äôclock, I was ready. Since the tryout didn‚Äôt start for another hour, my mom called me upstairs and forced me to have breakfast. I told her was too excited to eat but you know moms.

‚ÄúHave some eggs and toast, Grik. All of your little friends will have eaten breakfast. You don‚Äôt want to be starving when everyone else is full, do you?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not my friends, mom. They‚Äôre going to be my employees. I‚Äôm starting a business, here.‚Äù

‚ÄúEmployees, sorry. Do you want six eggs or seven?‚Äù

‚ÄúSeven please.‚Äù

She cracked them into the skillet and threw a loaf of bread in the toaster. My mom was human, but she understood the orc diet better than most people I knew. Even though I‚Äôd never seen her eat more than three plates of food at a time, she always made sure we, my dad, sister and I, had fifth helpings of everything. She was good that way.

My dad came in, dressed for yard work. During the week, he was an accountant in Castleton. He worked in the gold reserve at the palace. I didn‚Äôt know exactly what he did, something with conversion rates, but it required him to wear a tie and keep his tusks shiny. Today, he was dressed down in shorts and boat shoes. We had a nice house with the manicured lawn and two cars in the garage, and my mom always said how lucky we were that my dad had such a good job. That might have been true, but it was also so boring. Whenever he talked about his job, I would start to fall asleep.

I wanted adventure, danger, glory! I‚Äôd been asking for a battle ax for as long as I could remember, but my parents said that I had to wait until I was eighteen. That was two years away, a lifetime for an adventurer like me. In the meantime, I had turned an old baseball bat into a club. I‚Äôd even carved some runic symbols into it to make it more powerful. I didn‚Äôt know if they did anything, but I‚Äôd hit plenty of stuff and the bat was still in one piece, so something was working.

Mom slid a trey of eggs and half a loaf of bread in front of me and I gobbled them down as fast as I could. My sister rolled her eyes at me, but I didn‚Äôt care. Today was the start of *Adventurers, Inc.* The first step to being a real hero.

I finished, belched, and threw my plate into the sink.

‚ÄúCan I go get ready now?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes dear,‚Äù mom said. ‚ÄúYou can go play with your friends, now.‚Äù

‚ÄúMom! I told you they‚Äôre employees, not friends.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think you‚Äôre getting a little in over your head,‚Äù my dad said. He was reading the morning paper and sipping coffee. Mom slid a trey in front of him‚Äîfifteen eggs and two loaves of bread‚Äîand he set the paper down before shoveling the food into his mouth. When he finished, he burped loud enough to rattle the silver wear and patted his stomach. ‚ÄúGreat breakfast, Barb, thank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome my love. And I have to agree with your dad, Grik. Starting a business is a big deal, especially at your age. Don‚Äôt you want to be out riding your bike or playing baseball or doing something normal?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got your whole life to work, pal,‚Äù dad said. ‚ÄúIt sneaks up on you faster than you think. Trust me, I know.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd adventuring is such a hard life. Inconsistent, no insurance. And forget about retirement. I know you don‚Äôt want to be an accountant like your father but‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll never sit behind a desk,‚Äù I said, picking up my bat, which I had named Balinda after a gladiator I‚Äôd seen on the crystal ball one night after my parents had gone to sleep. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an adventurer. Its who I am. Dad crunches numbers. I crunch skulls.‚Äù

Polk exploded in giggles at that, spraying egg all over the table and then started choaking, which was exactly what she deserved. It was also my cue to leave.

‚ÄúPeople should start showing up any minute. Can you tell them to start a line in the hallway and I‚Äôll see them one at a time in the basement.

‚ÄúBut sweetheart‚Ä¶‚Äù mom said as she slammed her tiny human hand into Polk‚Äôs back. ‚ÄúI really think...‚Äù

‚ÄúMom, just be cool, alright. It‚Äôs going to work out.‚Äù I disappeared into the basement, my imagination filled with images of who I was going to see. A grizzled warlock who‚Äôd made an evil pact for unlimited power? A monk, silent but deadly, who could level the house with one empty hand? Maybe a paladin clad in silver armor, his holy sword slung over his back and the crest of his god seared onto his breastplate. Or a rogue, although no real rogue would use the front door. They‚Äôd just show up in the basement with me, hopefully with a knife to my throat. The possibilities were endless, and I stifled a squeal of excitement as I sat behind my examiner‚Äôs card table, note pad ready and Balinda leaning comfortingly against my leg.

\*\*\*

Two hours later, I stomped back upstairs, some of my excitement trickling away. No one had shown up, yet. I didn‚Äôt understand it. I put the date and time on the flyer, I know I did. Did I forget the address? No, I quadruple checked to make sure all the details were right before I ran the copies off on Dad‚Äôs APS-940. I knew I‚Äôd put up enough flyers. Mainstreet was plastered with them. I‚Äôd even put a few south of the tracks, thinking maybe I‚Äôd get a dwarf or two looking for extra work. But nothing. Something wasn‚Äôt right.

‚ÄúMom!‚Äù I shouted. Balinda was in my hand, and I tapped her against the countertop as I waited. Mom was upstairs folding laundry. Outside, dad was on his knees weeding the garden. His massive arms were almost ripping the sleeves of his blue polo shirt. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôd ever have arms like that. I was only a half-orc, and the half of me that was human was still a little scrawny. I needed to eat more eggs or something, but I could worry about that later. I had more pressing things on my mind.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong sweetheart?‚Äù Mom said, coming into the kitchen.

‚ÄúHas anyone shown up?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one has come by looking for my guild tryouts? Maybe someone you didn‚Äôt recognize and turned away? Anyone?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one‚Äôs come, hon. And I know what all of your friends look like. I‚Äôd never ask them to leave.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not my‚Ä¶never mind. Somethings going on. Why isn‚Äôt anyone here?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre a level 1 loser, that‚Äôs why!‚Äù My sister was at the top of the stairs, with her hands on her hips. She had leg warmers on and a green scrunchy wrapped into her hair. ‚ÄúNoone wants to be in your stupid loser‚Äôs guild.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up, pig face.‚Äù

‚ÄúTroll.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough you two.‚Äù Mom was a good two feet shorter than me and Polk, but she could shut us up when she needed to. Polk skipped down the stairs, suddenly the perfect daughter.

‚ÄúMommy, I‚Äôm going to the mall with Nayak and a few of the girls. Is that alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course it is. Have fun. Say high to everyone for me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will. Love you.‚Äù She stuck her tongue out at me as she skipped to the door, mouthing *bye looser* before slamming it behind her.

There was no way Polk was right. My flyer was gold. If I had seen it on the street, I‚Äôd have picked up Balinda and run straight over. Something was keeping all of the adventurers away, I just didn‚Äôt know what. Was every hero in Oreloc already guilded up? No, that didn‚Äôt make sense. There were plenty of independent contractors out there. Maybe there weren‚Äôt enough guts coming out of the dismembered goblin‚Ä¶

There was a knock at the door, and I jumped, wheeling Balinda around.

‚ÄúWill you put that thing away before you break something?‚Äù Mom said. Outside, dad peeked his head around the corner and raised his massive eyebrows. That was a good sign. Dad was an accountant so there wasn‚Äôt much that interested him.

‚ÄúAn adventurer,‚Äù I said. I had to suppress another squeal of excitement. Orcs didn‚Äôt squeal, at least not in public. Mom had started for the door, and I raced down the hall to stop her. ‚ÄúMom! Don‚Äôt let them in yet. Wait until I‚Äôm downstairs and then when you open the door say something like *oh, another one. You must be here for the tryout*. Sell it. Make it sound like we‚Äôve been swamped all morning. Okay? Okay, mom?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatever you say, Grik.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat. Remember. Sell it. And mom! Just be cool.‚Äù

With that, I ran back down to the basement and slid into place behind my card table. A second later, I heard the front door open and mom say ‚ÄúYou must be here for audition. Yes, many adventurers. More than you‚Äôd expect. In fact, we had to turn some away earlier. You are lucky. Very lucky. Well, come in. Can you wipe your feet for me? Thanks so much.‚Äù

She wasn‚Äôt selling it.

The basement door opened, and heavy footsteps started down the stairs. I held my breath as I waited to meet my first battle-scared hero of the day.

1jr1i3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1jr1i3n/quitting_the_second_time_was_way_harder_than_the/,Quitting the second time was way harder than the first.,"I quit nearly 5 years ago and I don‚Äôt remember it being that hard, it was just a tough week or two and then I started enjoying the benefits of reduced anxiety and even paced energy quite early on. 

Fast forward to quitting now, 4 weeks in (after being back on for 3 months) and it‚Äôs such a struggle. I feel so tired all the time and crappy mood most of the time.

The reason it‚Äôs been so hard only hit me today.

When I first quit I was in lockdown and couldn‚Äôt work from home. So I could rest, go for walks, do work around the house or garden, exercise and most importantly rest as much as I needed and not be chained to a desk. Now I‚Äôm back in an office staring at a screen all day and that‚Äôs been the biggest challenge for me. Weekends are easy, mornings, evenings, no problem. The 9-5? Brutal

We humans aren‚Äôt designed for this, no matter how meaningful it is or fun you find your job. Having to sit and focus on your screen and sit through meetings is not just hard, it feels like we‚Äôre going against human nature and coffee helps us to tolerate it. 

On the positive side my anxiety is down, I‚Äôm way more comfortable just chilling out, I read properly again (I literally couldn‚Äôt go for more than a few pages without being distracted), and I‚Äôm enjoying living a little slower, simpler and being more present. My resting heart rate rate is down 10%, I can fall asleep at high speed and I‚Äôm seeing more rem and deep sleep over shorter periods of sleep time and less mid-night wake ups.

TDLR is quitting would have been much easier for me if I was on holidays, between jobs or off work for any other reason. Also quitting has really emphasised just how painfully uncomfortable working in an office actually is. ",2,1743734540.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm 37, recently diagnosed with perimenopause after years of symptoms. I also have PCOS, a history of vitamin D deficiency, mild alpha thalassemia, and a high risk of osteoporosis. After seeing about 10 doctors and specialists, I finally landed with a menopause-focused doctor who connected the dots and suggested the following.

My morning routine looks like this:

Skincare:

Wash face
Niacinamide serum
Retinol anti-wrinkle moisturizer
Sunscreen
Oral care:

Brush
Floss
Waterpik
Alcohol-free mouthwash
Supplements/diet:

Collagen powder in coffee
Creatine in water
Protein/fiber smoothie between breakfast and lunch
Fish oil, multivitamin, Vitamin D + K, B12

Fitness:
I do resistance training, strength training, and light cardio regularly.

I eat as healthy as I can, but the supplements help make up for deficiencies and energy dips. I used to think this was all too much‚Äîuntil I started feeling better. Now I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs still over the top.

Intrepid Adventurers to join Oreloc‚Äôs newest adventuring guild! Are you a skilled warrior, mage, or rogue? Do you thirst for gold and glory? Then we want you! Tryouts this Saturday. NO BARDS.*

¬†

I nailed that add, and it only took two hours to write. It‚Äôs funny how the words just flow out of you when you know you‚Äôre doing something right. My parents thought this was a stupid idea. Why would anyone want to join my guild when they could drive into Castleton and sign up with one of the major guilds and make some serious questing money? They didn‚Äôt get it. Everyone knew that the big boys in the city started off small, just like I was doing. Give it a couple of years, I said, and I‚Äôll be set up in a nice cushy office, surrounded by treasure. Maybe I‚Äôd even get my name in the paper. I had big dreams, but first I needed a team.

I got my sister, Polk, to draw a picture of a half-orc (me, obviously), ripping the head off a goblin and spewing his guts all over the ground. I had to give her five gold pieces, and even then, needed to go back and add some extra blood‚Äîshe never does enough‚Äîbut when it was done, I had the perfect flyer. I used my dad‚Äôs Arcane Personal Scriptor to print off thirty copies and hung them all over town. Oreloc‚Äôs a suburb of Castleton and there are plenty of people around‚Äîorcs, fairies, gnomes, even a few dwarves‚Äîso I knew I‚Äôd get a good turnout. The elves live up in the Heights, where the mansions are, and I didn‚Äôt expect any of them to show up, but I didn‚Äôt need them anyway. An elf on the team would only make things more annoying.

Saturday morning came, and I was a wreck. I‚Äôd claimed the basement rumpus room as my tryout space and pushed all the furniture against the wall. The carpet was nailed down so there wasn‚Äôt much I could do about that, but I‚Äôd be sure no one got any blood anywhere. By nine o‚Äôclock, I was ready. Since the tryout didn‚Äôt start for another hour, my mom called me upstairs and forced me to have breakfast. I told her was too excited to eat but you know moms.

‚ÄúHave some eggs and toast, Grik. All of your little friends will have eaten breakfast. You don‚Äôt want to be starving when everyone else is full, do you?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not my friends, mom. They‚Äôre going to be my employees. I‚Äôm starting a business, here.‚Äù

‚ÄúEmployees, sorry. Do you want six eggs or seven?‚Äù

‚ÄúSeven please.‚Äù

She cracked them into the skillet and threw a loaf of bread in the toaster. My mom was human, but she understood the orc diet better than most people I knew. Even though I‚Äôd never seen her eat more than three plates of food at a time, she always made sure we, my dad, sister and I, had fifth helpings of everything. She was good that way.

My dad came in, dressed for yard work. During the week, he was an accountant in Castleton. He worked in the gold reserve at the palace. I didn‚Äôt know exactly what he did, something with conversion rates, but it required him to wear a tie and keep his tusks shiny. Today, he was dressed down in shorts and boat shoes. We had a nice house with the manicured lawn and two cars in the garage, and my mom always said how lucky we were that my dad had such a good job. That might have been true, but it was also so boring. Whenever he talked about his job, I would start to fall asleep.

‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre a level 1 loser, that‚Äôs why!‚Äù My sister was at the top of the stairs, with her hands on her hips. She had leg warmers on and a green scrunchy wrapped into her hair. ‚ÄúNoone wants to be in your stupid loser‚Äôs guild.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up, pig face.‚Äù

‚ÄúTroll.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough you two.‚Äù Mom was a good two feet shorter than me and Polk, but she could shut us up when she needed to. Polk skipped down the stairs, suddenly the perfect daughter.

‚ÄúMommy, I‚Äôm going to the mall with Nayak and a few of the girls. Is that alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course it is. Have fun. Say high to everyone for me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will. Love you.‚Äù She stuck her tongue out at me as she skipped to the door, mouthing *bye looser* before slamming it behind her.

There was no way Polk was right. My flyer was gold. If I had seen it on the street, I‚Äôd have picked up Balinda and run straight over. Something was keeping all of the adventurers away, I just didn‚Äôt know what. Was every hero in Oreloc already guilded up? No, that didn‚Äôt make sense. There were plenty of independent contractors out there. Maybe there weren‚Äôt enough guts coming out of the dismembered goblin‚Ä¶

There was a knock at the door, and I jumped, wheeling Balinda around.

‚ÄúWill you put that thing away before you break something?‚Äù Mom said. Outside, dad peeked his head around the corner and raised his massive eyebrows. That was a good sign. Dad was an accountant so there wasn‚Äôt much that interested him.

‚ÄúAn adventurer,‚Äù I said. I had to suppress another squeal of excitement. Orcs didn‚Äôt squeal, at least not in public. Mom had started for the door, and I raced down the hall to stop her. ‚ÄúMom! Don‚Äôt let them in yet. Wait until I‚Äôm downstairs and then when you open the door say something like *oh, another one. You must be here for the tryout*. Sell it. Make it sound like we‚Äôve been swamped all morning. Okay? Okay, mom?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatever you say, Grik.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat. Remember. Sell it. And mom! Just be cool.‚Äù

With that, I ran back down to the basement and slid into place behind my card table. A second later, I heard the front door open and mom say ‚ÄúYou must be here for audition. Yes, many adventurers. More than you‚Äôd expect. In fact, we had to turn some away earlier. You are lucky. Very lucky. Well, come in. Can you wipe your feet for me? Thanks so much.‚Äù

She wasn‚Äôt selling it.

The basement door opened, and heavy footsteps started down the stairs. I held my breath as I waited to meet my first battle-scared hero of the day.

Liver  / Adrenal / Colon / Circulatory,"I'm beyond frustrated.  I've been feeling like I'm having less energy, forgetting things I shouldn't and it's actually becoming noticeable and effecting relationships, and I get excited when I actually have a normal poop.  I'm a 40 yo female 180#s.  Most likely perimenopause.  Most of my life I've been in fight or flight.  From 21 to 38 I was a binge drinker. Turns out I wad coping for undiagnosed adhd, social anxiety and ptsd.  Live in drinking state where it's deeply ingrained in the culture. It's sad but I thought it was normal. I quit drinking about three years ago because I'd have one drink and get facial flushing and turn hot.  Have chest pains. Now that happens to me when I get stressed, have Starburst or candy, eat after long fast, or use my heated leather seats.  Feel like my body is not regulating temp.  I feel like when I eat my liver is struggling, my digestion is slow, I used to get constipated, now I just feel pressure like things are sitting in my colon fermenting.  But, seriously just started to get pressure near my anus these last few weeks and I'm freaking out. It's almost like I don't have the digestive enzymes to break it down. I struggle to eat consistently and when I do eat I feel rushed.  Eat the diet of a beef farmer and Midwestern US.  Recently started shifting to almost all whole foods.  These are my symptoms... I am beyond frustrated at this point.

Your Symptoms (Updated):

20s. Diagnosed with hyperhydrosis and easily bruising.  Played soccer in college and at one time had over 20 bruises.  Trainer told me to see specialist.  Specialist and his fancy fucking bow tie laughed at me and said I was fine.  Binge drank through college. Learned I was sensitive to sulfur.  Makes me feel like I was drugged. Married, two live vaginal births.

30s.  Hands hurt terrible and we're swollen, on fire.  Rheumatologist said it was Reactive arthritis due to untreated strep.  Lasted about three years.  Always felt better after antibiotics.  Still binge drinking.  Took nsaids.  Sometimes while drinking. Stupid I know.  Also prescripted Adderall.

40s shouldn't feel like this....

Fatigue and exhaustion‚Äîrarely completing a full day without energy tanking at some point.

Pinching piercing pain on the left side of your belly button before bowel movements when your core is engaged.

Pressure near the anus and constipation with slow digestion.

Terrible memory‚Äîforgetting names of people and places you've known for years.

Trouble focusing, possibly related to the exhaustion and cognitive fog.

Fluid retention in your feet (compression socks help).

Heel pain (relieved by daily hot baths).

Night sweats, facial flushing, and insomnia (feeling ‚Äúwired but tired‚Äù).

Fish Odor Syndrome *not diagnosed but i stink something terrible when i have mt dew coffee dt coke or or other caffeineted drinks or am stressed.  Dont drink sodas anymore.  It's like my body just doesn't metabolize them well. 
 when(Trimethylaminuria) and digestive inefficiencies.

Thinning eyebrows and hair shedding.

Joint pain sometimes in hands.

Diagnosed Hashimoto's (autoimmune thyroid disease).

Noticeable inflammation.

And I've noticed when I feel like i actually get energy back is after a round of antibiotics for an illness.

What bothers me most is the memory, pain in my anus and inconsistent poops, heel pain, exhaustion, feeling wired but tired when stressed (and will absolutely not sleep <3 hours when im in this state), and the facial flushing randomly.  No it's not hormones. 

I feel like I'm getting zero answers and taken so many tests.  If you know anything about these things, had similar experience, please help me and give me guidance.  I have kids I want to see grow up and be old.  I don't wantbit to be one of these things where it gets overlooked and maybe I'm just not advocating enough or loud enough.",1,1743733909.0,TheLiverDoc,0,1.0,False

1jr18ix,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalroad/comments/1jr18ix/is_my_random_idea_working/,Is my random idea working?,"I started a new story that's completely off the wall and not something I normally write. It's fun as hell but not what I usually see on Royal Road so I'm wondering if it works for the site or not.

Quick summary - Grik is a half-orc teenager who starts a guild out of his parent's suburban basement. He and his rag tag band of misfits start off with small quests around town, just to get their name out there, before they eventually move on to glory and riches.

*Wanted! Intrepid Adventurers to join Oreloc‚Äôs newest adventuring guild! Are you a skilled warrior, mage, or rogue? Do you thirst for gold and glory? Then we want you! Tryouts this Saturday. NO BARDS.*

¬†

I nailed that add, and it only took two hours to write. It‚Äôs funny how the words just flow out of you when you know you‚Äôre doing something right. My parents thought this was a stupid idea. Why would anyone want to join my guild when they could drive into Castleton and sign up with one of the major guilds and make some serious questing money? They didn‚Äôt get it. Everyone knew that the big boys in the city started off small, just like I was doing. Give it a couple of years, I said, and I‚Äôll be set up in a nice cushy office, surrounded by treasure. Maybe I‚Äôd even get my name in the paper. I had big dreams, but first I needed a team.

I got my sister, Polk, to draw a picture of a half-orc (me, obviously), ripping the head off a goblin and spewing his guts all over the ground. I had to give her five gold pieces, and even then, needed to go back and add some extra blood‚Äîshe never does enough‚Äîbut when it was done, I had the perfect flyer. I used my dad‚Äôs Arcane Personal Scriptor to print off thirty copies and hung them all over town. Oreloc‚Äôs a suburb of Castleton and there are plenty of people around‚Äîorcs, fairies, gnomes, even a few dwarves‚Äîso I knew I‚Äôd get a good turnout. The elves live up in the Heights, where the mansions are, and I didn‚Äôt expect any of them to show up, but I didn‚Äôt need them anyway. An elf on the team would only make things more annoying.

Saturday morning came, and I was a wreck. I‚Äôd claimed the basement rumpus room as my tryout space and pushed all the furniture against the wall. The carpet was nailed down so there wasn‚Äôt much I could do about that, but I‚Äôd be sure no one got any blood anywhere. By nine o‚Äôclock, I was ready. Since the tryout didn‚Äôt start for another hour, my mom called me upstairs and forced me to have breakfast. I told her was too excited to eat but you know moms.

‚ÄúHave some eggs and toast, Grik. All of your little friends will have eaten breakfast. You don‚Äôt want to be starving when everyone else is full, do you?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not my friends, mom. They‚Äôre going to be my employees. I‚Äôm starting a business, here.‚Äù

‚ÄúEmployees, sorry. Do you want six eggs or seven?‚Äù

‚ÄúSeven please.‚Äù

She cracked them into the skillet and threw a loaf of bread in the toaster. My mom was human, but she understood the orc diet better than most people I knew. Even though I‚Äôd never seen her eat more than three plates of food at a time, she always made sure we, my dad, sister and I, had fifth helpings of everything. She was good that way.

My dad came in, dressed for yard work. During the week, he was an accountant in Castleton. He worked in the gold reserve at the palace. I didn‚Äôt know exactly what he did, something with conversion rates, but it required him to wear a tie and keep his tusks shiny. Today, he was dressed down in shorts and boat shoes. We had a nice house with the manicured lawn and two cars in the garage, and my mom always said how lucky we were that my dad had such a good job. That might have been true, but it was also so boring. Whenever he talked about his job, I would start to fall asleep.

I wanted adventure, danger, glory! I‚Äôd been asking for a battle ax for as long as I could remember, but my parents said that I had to wait until I was eighteen. That was two years away, a lifetime for an adventurer like me. In the meantime, I had turned an old baseball bat into a club. I‚Äôd even carved some runic symbols into it to make it more powerful. I didn‚Äôt know if they did anything, but I‚Äôd hit plenty of stuff and the bat was still in one piece, so something was working.

Mom slid a trey of eggs and half a loaf of bread in front of me and I gobbled them down as fast as I could. My sister rolled her eyes at me, but I didn‚Äôt care. Today was the start of *Adventurers, Inc.* The first step to being a real hero.

I finished, belched, and threw my plate into the sink.

‚ÄúCan I go get ready now?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes dear,‚Äù mom said. ‚ÄúYou can go play with your friends, now.‚Äù

‚ÄúMom! I told you they‚Äôre employees, not friends.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think you‚Äôre getting a little in over your head,‚Äù my dad said. He was reading the morning paper and sipping coffee. Mom slid a trey in front of him‚Äîfifteen eggs and two loaves of bread‚Äîand he set the paper down before shoveling the food into his mouth. When he finished, he burped loud enough to rattle the silver wear and patted his stomach. ‚ÄúGreat breakfast, Barb, thank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome my love. And I have to agree with your dad, Grik. Starting a business is a big deal, especially at your age. Don‚Äôt you want to be out riding your bike or playing baseball or doing something normal?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got your whole life to work, pal,‚Äù dad said. ‚ÄúIt sneaks up on you faster than you think. Trust me, I know.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd adventuring is such a hard life. Inconsistent, no insurance. And forget about retirement. I know you don‚Äôt want to be an accountant like your father but‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll never sit behind a desk,‚Äù I said, picking up my bat, which I had named Balinda after a gladiator I‚Äôd seen on the crystal ball one night after my parents had gone to sleep. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an adventurer. Its who I am. Dad crunches numbers. I crunch skulls.‚Äù

Polk exploded in giggles at that, spraying egg all over the table and then started choaking, which was exactly what she deserved. It was also my cue to leave.

‚ÄúPeople should start showing up any minute. Can you tell them to start a line in the hallway and I‚Äôll see them one at a time in the basement.

‚ÄúBut sweetheart‚Ä¶‚Äù mom said as she slammed her tiny human hand into Polk‚Äôs back. ‚ÄúI really think...‚Äù

‚ÄúMom, just be cool, alright. It‚Äôs going to work out.‚Äù I disappeared into the basement, my imagination filled with images of who I was going to see. A grizzled warlock who‚Äôd made an evil pact for unlimited power? A monk, silent but deadly, who could level the house with one empty hand? Maybe a paladin clad in silver armor, his holy sword slung over his back and the crest of his god seared onto his breastplate. Or a rogue, although no real rogue would use the front door. They‚Äôd just show up in the basement with me, hopefully with a knife to my throat. The possibilities were endless, and I stifled a squeal of excitement as I sat behind my examiner‚Äôs card table, note pad ready and Balinda leaning comfortingly against my leg.

\*\*\*

Two hours later, I stomped back upstairs, some of my excitement trickling away. No one had shown up, yet. I didn‚Äôt understand it. I put the date and time on the flyer, I know I did. Did I forget the address? No, I quadruple checked to make sure all the details were right before I ran the copies off on Dad‚Äôs APS-940. I knew I‚Äôd put up enough flyers. Mainstreet was plastered with them. I‚Äôd even put a few south of the tracks, thinking maybe I‚Äôd get a dwarf or two looking for extra work. But nothing. Something wasn‚Äôt right.

‚ÄúMom!‚Äù I shouted. Balinda was in my hand, and I tapped her against the countertop as I waited. Mom was upstairs folding laundry. Outside, dad was on his knees weeding the garden. His massive arms were almost ripping the sleeves of his blue polo shirt. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôd ever have arms like that. I was only a half-orc, and the half of me that was human was still a little scrawny. I needed to eat more eggs or something, but I could worry about that later. I had more pressing things on my mind.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong sweetheart?‚Äù Mom said, coming into the kitchen.

‚ÄúHas anyone shown up?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one has come by looking for my guild tryouts? Maybe someone you didn‚Äôt recognize and turned away? Anyone?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one‚Äôs come, hon. And I know what all of your friends look like. I‚Äôd never ask them to leave.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not my‚Ä¶never mind. Somethings going on. Why isn‚Äôt anyone here?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre a level 1 loser, that‚Äôs why!‚Äù My sister was at the top of the stairs, with her hands on her hips. She had leg warmers on and a green scrunchy wrapped into her hair. ‚ÄúNoone wants to be in your stupid loser‚Äôs guild.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up, pig face.‚Äù

‚ÄúTroll.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough you two.‚Äù Mom was a good two feet shorter than me and Polk, but she could shut us up when she needed to. Polk skipped down the stairs, suddenly the perfect daughter.

# What Is ""Linking Your Thinking - Nick Milo"" All About?

Alright, let‚Äôs break it down‚Äî**""Linking Your Thinking - Nick Milo""** is not your average online course. It‚Äôs a **6-week deep-dive live workshop** designed to help you build a Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system that actually works *for you*. This isn‚Äôt just about storing notes or organizing your bookmarks‚Äîit‚Äôs about making connections between your ideas, discovering insights, and finally putting your scattered thoughts into a system you can *trust*.

# Who Is It For?

If you're someone who‚Äôs always juggling ideas, notes, inspirations, and bookmarks across different apps (hello, 99 open tabs!), this is *definitely* for you. Writers, researchers, content creators, students, entrepreneurs‚Äîheck, even curious hobbyists‚Äîwill find major value here. Whether you're using Obsidian, Notion, or even plain text files, **""Linking Your Thinking - Nick Milo""** is all about helping *you* craft a PKM system that fits like a glove.

# Why Does It Matter?

Because your brain is full of gold‚Äîyou just need a way to mine it efficiently. Most digital tools just help you collect more clutter, but Nick‚Äôs system teaches you to connect ideas, not just store them. Think less ""information dump"" and more ""knowledge garden."" In a world drowning in data, being able to *link your thinking* is honestly a superpower.

# When and How Does It Work?

The workshop runs over six weeks, and everything is **drip-fed**‚Äîmeaning you won‚Äôt be overwhelmed. Each week, you get a new unit with video lessons and practical exercises (about an hour per week), plus there are **12 live sessions** for real-time learning and interaction. Don‚Äôt worry if you can‚Äôt make a session‚Äîrecordings are provided!

And yep, it‚Äôs not just passive learning. There‚Äôs a **24/7 online community**, peer mentoring, and even fun extras like Rendezvous Week and Topic Clubs. It‚Äôs like a cozy brain gym for note nerds.

# Where Do You Access It?

This is a long story but I want to make it short.

I met this guy last year in April in the library and we opened up a lot, very fast. He eventually introduced me to a lot of his friends and family and we talked more (started going to his church). He's one of those very argumentative guys who has strong beliefs and rarely negotiates (loves to debate types and laugh at you for not agreeing with him). I didn't see this side of him until things settled down.

I gave him a lot of advice regarding girls and career stuff etc. I came to him for advice like once regarding a job interview I had even though he doesn't have experience with interviews (he works at a movie theatre and I work in a high rise office. im not putting him down when I say this for your information but he hints at wishing he could do my type of job). The other day, the topic of politics came up and he mentioned how he is a republican and asked what I support and I said democrat. He said he guessed its probably because my father was a democrat and I said yes, partially but not entirely because of my father. He laughed and said how much (in terms of influence) ? I said I wouldn't quantify it and then he said ok ""I'm gonna assume a lot"" and started to tell me about how everything ive agreed with is basically what republicans support. it sounded like he was trying to convince me, subtly - even started telling me to go read more on DJT and what he stands for and to not listen to media's that destroy his reputation.

The next day, over text, I addressed the part where he assumed im solely a democrat because of my father and said ""Hey Charles, I didn‚Äôt appreciate how you tried boxing me in yesterday when you said you believe the reason I‚Äôm liberal is solely due to my father after I told you I didn‚Äôt want to go into politics. An apology will suffice"". This sparked conflict and asked me to meet him in person which I did. But he sent this before we met that evening when we went back and forth :

""Ok. See you next time. Consider this friendship over. But I‚Äôm looking forward to taking about what you didn‚Äôt like about what I said and, if warranted, an apology will be made. Things will be cordial and amicable moving forward, but this friendship is over my dear bro. You are my brother in Christ, but a friendship is out of the question. I‚Äôll hit u up for next time. I‚Äôm looking forward to it.""

I ended up going to meet. I bought us both coffee at Starbucks and sat on a couch with him. In person, he insulted my character, raised his voice and said I only asked him to apologize because I have low self esteem and low confidence and how I want to bring him down to my level by forcing an apology and submit, how he doesn't trust me, how I love to argue, how controlling I am etc. I told him he's wrong about me and im not doing that and even mentioned the things ive done for him that were in his best interest like uplift him (not to come off as bragging but to dismantle his argument and show him my perspective).

After he left. I sent him this :

I don‚Äôt feel bad about myself Charles nor do I have low self esteem. I'm ok the way I am, Charles even much better than others

This apology thing bothered you that much, to the point where you began insulting me and throwing all kinds of bad words in my direction.¬†

People do things in their life, sometimes bad sometimes good, even you joke about it when it happens.¬†

But you took it seriously today (even the texting) and threw unnecessary bad words against my character.¬†Non stop.

I‚Äôm not interested in ever being friends after this. I don‚Äôt deserve this type of treatment and disrespect. Ciao for now"".

Its been almost 9 weeks of no contact and i've stopped going to that specific church (I get texts from people at church saying they miss me and asking if everything is alright but I just say ive been busy with work and school stuff to avoid drama). When he sees me in passing he just nods my head or actually gives me a pound with his fist and says ""hey what's up Adam"". AITA ?",1,1743733094.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

1jr0zl8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SPNAnalysis/comments/1jr0zl8/nightmare_1_death_by_lack_of_headrests/,Nightmare (1): Death by lack of headrests.,"***Supernatural,*** **Season 1**  
**Episode 14, ‚ÄúNightmare‚Äù**  
**Written by Sera Gamble and Raelle Tucker**  
**Directed by Philip Sgriccia**

This is the first of many *Supernatural* episodes that were directed by the talented Phil Sgriccia. His cinematic style made for many visually memorable episodes, and this is no exception. It contains a number of dramatic, not to mention shocking, images - but we'll get to those . . . Paired with the writing team who already brought us ""Dead in the Water"" and ""Faith"", we can expect this to be another emotionally intense, character driven episode.  
  
It begins with the supernatural murder of one Jim Miller. Locked in his car and inside his garage by some unseen force, he's unable to escape when exhaust smoke starts pouring through the dashboard vents and he consequently dies of asphyxiation and CO2 poisoning.

https://preview.redd.it/k8hpwsrk0qse1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee4930c48418296d1168f66101da335ce45a8258

I've heard if you're ever in this position, and you have headrests on your seats, you can pull them off and use them to smash the windows. So I guess our victim of the week died of a lack of headrests.  
  
For those who watched the aired episode (or the DVD), and are very familiar with Bob Seger's songs, there may have been an early clue to the identity of the perpertrator in the track that was playing as Jim drove up to the house and into his garage; the first verse of Seger's ""2+2=?"" begins ""yes, it's true I am a young man/but I'm old enough to kill.""

After a clutter of random images from the garage, including a number plate, the scene shifts to Sam in bed and we realize it's another one of his psychic dreams. As he sits up we see that he's sweating.

https://preview.redd.it/8n07zi7z0qse1.jpg?width=515&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=002c220291336cc247d1c3747fe77cf6993884e9

The nightmares are beginning to take a physical toll on him. That's going to become an important point later.  
  
I love how the scene ends, with Sam hustling Dean to get moving, and we get this lovely transition from a lamp on the desk to the Impala's headlamps as the brothers hit the road:

https://preview.redd.it/tyfzmwy41qse1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee91ed10e4a250c5f67b04cd90a40c9762c82dbc

https://preview.redd.it/1dq3wwy41qse1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65806d76dd1598d8005cccf700858244c868f557

It does a great job of moving the action along smoothly and helps to create the sense of dramatic urgency.

Sam and Dean arrive at Jim Miller's house to find him already dead, purportedly from suicide. Both brothers are clearly disturbed by Sam's prophetic dreams.

https://preview.redd.it/wwhpxtzq1qse1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2036a4866c02128669e35d940c47fe420f4518bc

""I'm not looking at you like anything,"" Dean insists. ""Though, I gotta say, you look like crap.""

The episode script emphasizes that Sam looks pale and sweaty in this scene, still suffering from the effects of his vision. ([http://www.supernaturalwiki.com/1.14\_Nightmare#Sides.2C\_Scripts\_.26\_Transcripts](http://www.supernaturalwiki.com/1.14_Nightmare#Sides.2C_Scripts_.26_Transcripts)) It doesn't really come across on screen however - Sam looks physically fine here - which is unfortunate because a visual emphasis on Sam's vision-ravaged appearance would have helped to make Dean's comment make sense. More importantly, the scriptwriters clearly hoped to indicate a subtle optical clue and parallel to Max as we see him later.

This episode is infamous for another memorable scene:

https://preview.redd.it/brv2fs713qse1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=886ed36b932f37b64b4176d196174b4c945f33d7

For some reason, fans seem to get very excited whenever the brothers appear in priest attire. Mind you, when they think of this scene, I think many remember the season one gag reel more vividly:  


https://preview.redd.it/sxzidr713qse1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f2126e73b5ef7a90f2e06f3ea606495294ad5683

It seems the *Supernatural* fandom acquired a reputation for being a somewhat kinky bunch. I have no idea where that came from . . .

https://preview.redd.it/53ddo76q3qse1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34442a7c5f4cd383a6140c4e80c2a4ee698ca857

If any of you assumed Dean was staring inappropriately at Mrs Miller's chest in this frame, that might be a reasonable guess, but you'd be wrong: he's actually eyeing the casserole dish she's holding.

https://preview.redd.it/2hw94r7w4qse1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c14e2fdf7dacdcef4f69ccb0f13d97793518f226

Popular fanon has it that the reason Dean stuffs his face at every available opportunity is because he frequently went hungry to feed Sam in their childhood but, in fact, the show writers never intended any such dark backstory. The truth is, the running gag began when Jensen did a comic bit as an adlib just because he thought it was funny. The show runners agreed, so they ran with it. It's just a lighthearted gag folks, and I think it's pretty funny. üòÜ

https://preview.redd.it/i97l4ay08qse1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fd77365ec2e1690bd2b95f4ee5a111cee1521aa

Here we see Sam carefully balancing a cup of coffee to avoid spilling its contents. When he's first given the cup, he quickly snatches one hand away and flicks his fingers, indicating that the coffee was hot enough to singe his fingertips. I love that Jared always conscientiously adds these little details to try to convince us there's actually something in those cups! üòÜ



https://preview.redd.it/795874m46qse1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bf75215aa2374a80ed52cc8af921d40828226e61

In Sam's first interview with Max Miller, we see the boy looks pale and his skin has a sweaty sheen to it. At this stage, it's easily attributable to the trauma of losing his father, especially because he reveals he found the body. Later, however, we'll realize that using his powers takes a physical toll on him, just as Sam's visions do on him.  
  
Another detail that's dropped in this conversation is that Max is living at home because he's struggling to save for college. Presumably he lacked the intellectual ability to score a full ride, but his desire to go to college at least is something with which Sam can identify.

https://preview.redd.it/x08rd72l6qse1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b3c0ad2a59fee874c64de37233451e8d06b59b5

Meanwhile, Dean is checking the house for cold spots. I believe this was the one and only time we saw the infrared thermal scanner. I liked it because it's another authentic tool used by real life paranormal investigators to detect cold spots etc. But perhaps the show runners thought it was too high-tech for our blue-collar brothers. It's certainly a big step up from the homemade EMF meter Dean jigged up from an old Walkman earlier in the season!

1jr0zc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jr0zc6/i_dont_know_what_to_do_about_this_situation/,I don‚Äôt know what to do about this situation,"So, my girlfriend and I, both 20-year-olds, are in a long-distance relationship. She has a stutter and attends a support group. There, she met a guy named James in her AP class who also has a stutter and is 28 years old. He asked her if she wanted to get coffee after class at Starbucks. She asked me if she could go, and asked me if I was okay with it? I felt like he was asking her out, so I didn‚Äôt want her to go. She agreed!

Later, I realized I was holding her back, and felt like she wanted to go. So, I told her it was her choice. She added that her aunt and friend also thought it could just be a thing like friends. She said she didn‚Äôt have any time during the week and would see what to do about it.

Today, she texts me that she‚Äôs getting coffee with James and asks if I want to FaceTime later. I said okay! After getting coffee, neither said anything about it on text or FaceTime. I didn‚Äôt feel like asking, so I don‚Äôt know what to do or feel!",1,1743732900.0,Advice,5,1.0,False
