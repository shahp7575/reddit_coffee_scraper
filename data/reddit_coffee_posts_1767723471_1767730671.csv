Hi everyone, thanks for checking in.

I'm moving into this new space soon, please see the floorplan and images above.

It is the best choice I could afford on my current wage and the amount of time I had to search, a small space for myself as I live in a fairly expensive city at the minute. My major concerns are storage space, as the bed doesn't have any storage options at all (Devan with no drawers). I don't have a tonne of things to bring with me, but I do have a computer desk with computer, and a lot of books ranging from regular softbacks to TTRPG books.

I have never had a place purely to myself before that I know I could really kit out like this (within reason for renting), and I am not sure at all how to start or even what I can do to help my space situation or decoration. I do struggle with my mental health, and I want to try and make the place cosy if possible, but not having too much clutter around the place.

I will take any advice or other bits people have, I've asked for the coffee table to be removed as that takes up a lot of space since its only me in the property anyway.

Don't act brave, admit it, it scares you doesn't it?  Truth is, everybody is scared of dying… and if they say they aren't, they're lying.

I know death, I've seen it more than a few times in my line of work– because well, I’m a cop. I also see plenty of people who put on a brave face– false courage masking real fear. I know that mask. Hell, I’ve worn it practically every day of my life. But now things are different; I can't wear that mask anymore. When I met it, death didn't just scare me; it spoke to me, it shook my  hand, even offered me tea –but by my own choices I know that my true nightmares lie just beyond that final horizon.

My career has had its rough patches.. There's been days, more than you can count on two hands at least, where I've gone home shaking– tears running down my face because of what I saw… or what I did. I transferred from a big city to a small town after that last one.

That isn't important anyway, what's important is the start of my fears…my fear of death and another lifelong fear. The fear of fire. 
The first time I met death was the morning of my 9th birthday. A smell wafted through the house, sweet and sticky like the sugary glaze coating a fresh batch of honey buns. Mom was making that delicious birthday cake I had begged every night for as I faded in and out of sleep.

I dreamt that dad was sprinting through a thick forest of blurred shades of green and brown. Suddenly, a grenade exploded next to him, but he dodged at the last moment, ducking behind a tree as I stared. Thick billowing black sizzled from the ground and a strong gunpowder scent filled my nostrils. I found myself coughing hard, my throat stinging.

Suddenly my eyes flew open. Something was wrong. It was strange at first as I tried to shake the fog of sleep away from my weary eyes and mind. The illusion of my running dad was gone, but the burning in my throat lingered. An odd smell permeated the air. It was still sweet and sticky like before…  still hot and clinging like icing– but now there was something else. It was acrid and sharp and it left me coughing as I took another deep breath. Finally, as the drowsiness of my dreams left me, I saw the state of the hazed room. Everything became clear at that moment.

Fire.

I remember racing down the stairs– running faster than I ever figured my legs could carry me, I bolted down past the hot air that made my skin burn and my lungs ache, finally reaching the bottom floor.

The smoke there was thick, but I could see its source piercing through the smog. The flames were like a hungry beast with a hundred red and yellow fiery tendrils. It poured from the stove, creeping up the flowery wallpaper as if the painted plant fibers were truly giving it more fuel.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

“Help!! Somebody help!! It's stuck!” A muffled voice pleaded.
 
My head swam as the heat stung my eyes and lapped at my skin. The basement door finally caved a bit, the wood splintering as the three loud bangs from before turned into a steady pounding of metal on wood. I wanted to move... I needed to move, but I didn't.

The end of the hammer burst through the door and a hail of wooden shards rained onto the floor below. Again the shouting resumed, much clearer now as he pressed his mouth to the newly formed hole.

“Blake?!.. Nancy!? Help! Something fell in front of the door!” He screamed and then I understood.

Forgive me… I can't go into detail about the next part. Hell, therapy can only do so much and the tears always come stronger than the alcohol can stop them. He kept screaming for help– calling again and again until the roaring of the flames drowned him out.

In the end, mom got me out, yanked me outside into the driest summer of my life. It was already too late when the firefighters arrived.  I heard the same sirens days later as the police car led the funeral procession to the military graveyard.
Since that day, I've been terrified of death and that acrid horrible smell of smoke. I'm terrified of dying like my father– screaming as the flames burn away my body and spirit.

With my fears, like I mentioned, you'll probably think it strange I chose the career that I did. Being a police officer gave me something, a sense of control.. It felt like I was finally making up for being too scared to move that day so long ago.

That leads us to recent events. These past weeks have scared me more deeply than that tragic birthday and I'm sure now that my fear of dying in flames is no longer irrational…

The day started like every other, a stale cup of coffee lukewarm in my red mug, the grounds coarse and clinging to the side as I took a long swig. The black fluid oozed down my throat like tar, but I was thankful for the caffeine as it nursed the hangover from the previous night.

A scruffy younger looking officer came in, his black hair disheveled by the wind outside. I saw his smirk and the bounce in his step before I even turned to face him. It was John, my partner, and the closest thing I have had to a friend in a long time.

“What's on the itinerary tonight, Blake? Wait! Don't tell me… let me guess..” John paused, scratching at the stubble on his chin, “We gotta go on a patrol, then we sit on the side of the street shooting the shit for a while?”

“Yup, sounds like our day everyday this past week…”

“One difference this shift though,” I added.

“And what's that?” John asked.

“Coffee tastes even worse today.”

“I can deal with that.” He chuckled as he poured some of the swill into his mug. 
_
Six hours later, we're sitting in front of Poor Paulie's Pub with the spinning red and blues on. Night had fallen over the town and the patter of rain knocked against our windshield. As we got out of the car I felt warm wet spots dripping down across my uniform; the uncomfortable warmth reminding me of dripping gore, like the sky was wounded. The shadows of the waning daylight seemed to mimic bony hands clasping around the entrance as we reached the faded wooden door. The painted red and yellow letters inscribed on the wood were all but legible, but the frequent visitors of this bar didn't find this place by name, they found it by misery.

John reached the door first and placed a firm hand on the knob as he slowly creaked it open.

“Magnolia P.D! Make yourself known!” He screamed into the small opening, piercing the veil of silence beyond the pub door just like I had taught him. His gaze met mine and I noticed a palpable discomfort washing over him.

This time, I eased forward, gripping the door frame like I was digging my fingers into an anchor, hoping it would keep me from slipping away.

“We don't want any trouble, ok? We're here to help you! Just tell us your name!”

No reply– the bar was eerily quiet besides the occasional clinking of glass. I took a deep breath and pushed the wooden door open, my hand resting on my service weapon. I was ready for anything, but there was no use in immediately escalating the situation. John followed suit and gave me a nod as he went by, taking the lead. The door creaked painfully as we headed inside the dim building. My eyes landed first on our suspect who had made himself comfortable behind the counter. Evidently he had been drinking quite a bit considering the three empty liquor bottles overturned on the counter, their contents leaking across the wood like corpses.

“Woah buddy. I hope those were already nearly empty or you're in for a rough night.” John said, trying to test the waters.

As if reading in between the lines of John's humor, he answered by doing something I would have never expected. He pulled another bottle of vodka off the shelf. He pulled the cork out with an audible pop. And then…he began pouring it all over his head.

“Sir! What are—” I started, but I was immediately interrupted.

“Burn! I'm going to burn! But I'm not burning on her terms!” He screamed, his back to us as he reached for another bottle.

The severity of the situation dawned on us and we exchanged panicked looks.

“Ok, buddy… Let's talk about this. You're not gonna burn.“ I reassured, inching forward with John close behind. If he kept his back to us, reasoning with nothing more than a nod, we could both sneak up and incapacitate him.

A small whimper instead filled the air and we held our breath as the hulking man in front of us slumped forward. Hope lingered on the horizon as he suddenly wept, but we couldn’t have been more wrong. He spun around and looked at us, a lighter clutched tightly in his hand.

“Put it down! Don't do it!” John screamed as we drew our guns reflexively.

Lo and behold it appeared to work. Staring at us both, he froze, his finger on the plastic lighter with the same weight of a hammer on a revolver, but he did nothing. Looking now at his face, I could see nothing more than a tired man. Dark heavy bags lingered under his red stained eyes. He looked sick, like a leper drowning in booze.

“I can’t believe it…You… I know you,” he paused, “You're the motherfucker behind this!”

“YOU are the one that's damned me!” He hissed; his finger and the lighter extended in a sharp point directly at me.

I opened my mouth to say something, to offer any assortment of words that I might remember from our deescalation training, but before I could… it just happened so fast. There was no time to react, even as everything slowed down to a crawl in my perception. One moment he was yelling and John was about to holler back and then and only then did the man behind the counter raise his other hand. A revolver gleamed in the dim bar light and before anybody could utter a sound– he fired.

The round he chambered fired hot, real hot. Must have been an old bullet, warped and pitted like a bad apple because the gun didn't just bark; it roared. A hail of sparks blasted from the barrel and the alcohol caught like dry kindling. It was instant. Flames covering him. 
John dodged to the right as soon as he heard the shot, leaping behind a low wall between the bar and some old tattered booths with peeling vinyl.

I couldn't do anything. My God, how those flames climbed– it was just like…

“Blake!! Get the Hell down!” John screamed, but the sounds seemed underwater. The bullet wisped past me like a sonic dart and dug into the brick wall, but even then I was motionless. 

Smoke rose up and the scent hit my nostrils– acrid and sour– like a bat being slammed into my gut. All I could see was the fire climbing the ceiling and crawling across the floor like before. All I could hear were the screams of a man burning. Was it him or my dad’s voice echoing in my ears?

“Help!! Somebody help!” He screamed.. Or  they screamed? One or both, Dad or stranger, but never neither.

Another roar echoed from the iron dragon and the scent of burnt gunpowder once again filled the room. This time the bullet hit its mark. 
Cold and black. Cold and black awaited me. 
_
And then… cookies? Chocolate chip. I could smell them before I could even see. They smelled sweet and the scent of chocolate was stronger than I'd ever smelt before and yet it still wasn't overpowering– in fact it melted into another scent– an abstract one. Familiarity.

I opened my eyes and like a phantom materializing I suddenly felt solid once again, as if being born into a new existence. Sunlight filtered in through two glassless windows that offered me a view of miles of lavish countryside. Purple horned lavender and grape vineyards sprawled into a dazzling clouded sunrise. Humming to the right of the windows was a figure shrouded in a veil of glittering white fabric. Her face was hidden and yet, I didn't feel the slightest hint of fear while I was in her presence.

“You haven't asked yet, so I'm figuring you've guessed by now, haven't you hun?”

Her voice was slow and firm, deliberate in each of its syllables, but still undeniably sweet in its cadence. Its tone rose and fell like a warm melody and I noticed an aged wisdom like quality wine. It's like each word had a weight to it, but the weight swaddled your shoulders like a comforting blanket rather than crushing you. At that moment if I had any doubts before, they were gone. I was dead. She spun around and I got the first glimpse of her face.

Her eyes were grey clouds, like gentle thunderstorms brewing on a distant horizon. Her wrinkled brown skin followed the curvature of a gentle sloping face. I followed the long white and gray locks that cascaded past her deep ebony lips which were gently curved into a welcoming smile.

Without ever seeing her move, she was suddenly nearby, her movements like smoke across water. She now sat calmly in the wooden chair across from me, bringing a glass of steaming tea up to her lips. In the briefest of glances I found myself lost in those crystal ball-like eyes. Despite the shock of absorbing so much– even then I felt at peace sitting in her presence, like I just saw a movie of my life and simply understood.

With a wrinkled hand, she gently slid the plate of cookies forward and offered a toothy grin that showcased a small gap between her teeth. Sitting to my right was my own glass of hot tea, one I hadn't even noticed until that very moment.

“Here take a cookie sweetie, we have a whole lot to discuss…” She stated between sips of her hot tea, “Much more than most that come here for their last visit.”

I opened my mouth to say something, but no assortment of words could truly convey the weight of the hundreds of thoughts plaguing my mind. Instead, a shaking hand reached down and grabbed one of her cookies like a child accepting a reward.

Her gentle expression faltered for a moment, her brows furrowing over those two pools of grey and white. She wasn't upset, but rather, in deep concentration, as if remembering an unpleasant memory. I stayed silent, nibbling the cookie as I watched.

My gaze shifted to my right. The plain, orange tinted wall began to shimmer, the paint peeling until we both peered into a clearing, a small dirt area among vast Autumn trees. From my right peripheral I suddenly saw movement, the undeniable reason why I was being shown this vivid memory. His chest rose and fell in an odd rhythm, asynchronous and labored. Two crimson waterfalls trailed down his stomach, soaking through his stained cotton shirt like a sponge before dripping down his side into hungry puddles. A long shaft of wood protruded from each of the two holes oozing blood, and I could see white and black feathers adorning the ends. 

“He's dying.. Who is he?” I asked.

“Not just who, Blake. When?” She replied.

I noticed now, looking closer at his blood stained shirt, that his attire was ancient looking, like the history section of an early American museum. Everything was made of cotton, and his pants were worn to the point of only being held up by two suspenders fashioned out of frayed rope.

“He's a Howell just like you, Blake. He's a relative– just one that’s a great number of greats away from being remembered.” She added.

“I don't get it,” I questioned, but my tone felt weak in my throat, “Why do I need to see this?”

She took a long gulp of her tea, swallowing a mouthful despite the steam still indicating its scalding temperature. It felt like she needed that sort of heat, like she needed to burn something back down in her, to keep it at bay. If that was the case however, she didn't show it, kindness still fell from her like flower petals. 
“Watch, my sweet.. Watch.”

I turned back to the scene and watched with a silent sense of trepidation. My family member, though unknown to me, was dying slowly, bleeding out from two fatal arrow wounds and I could do nothing but watch him fade. Slowly, his ragged breaths drew even but they were short and weak, like the coals in a fire right before they went out. His body stilled and a rattle of air forced itself from his body, the last wisp of flame as he died alone, wounded in the forest. Had I had more time to process, I might have grieved from the experience…

Without warning, he took a long sharp breath, his stomach and body rising into the air as if lifted by an unseen force, and then he fell back to the ground. The waterfalls of blood now flowed barely as trickles, and his wounds were no longer in the same places. A gaping stomach wound and pierced lung become an injured shoulder and a skewered flank– painful wounds, but survivable.

“T-that's amazing! You saved him… Could you give me the same gift?“ I immediately began, relief washing over me as I realized the second chance she presented.

“Gift…” She scoffed and turned her head away from the scene. For the first time I felt a new feeling brewing and steaming off of her like the tea that sat unchangingly hot.

“It's not a gift…” She said as she took a deep breath that seemed nearly painful, “...And I only did what I was forced to do– forced by a deal passed long before me. Your relative that died here was only my first Howell boy. The real origin goes back long ago, many Reapers before my turn.”

“I don't understand.. “ I started, but I wasn't even sure where to start. More questions swirled around my head like gnats, landing in my thoughts for only a moment before the next intruded.

She noticed the shift in my facial features before even I did. Her glossy looking eyes were seemingly sharper than the most predatory hawk. Her muscles tensed under the white veil, giving the impression of strength beyond her apparent years, but also a toned beauty reflecting in the same way.

“Before I explain more… “ She looked away, almost dejected, “I'm sorry for this, but you must understand the gravity of these consequences, my sweet. It has to be personal.”

She pushed the plate of cookies forward and locked eyes with me. A small frown spread across her brown lips, the shape rebelling against the laugh lines that acknowledged her true temperament. A warm hand clasped around mine, squeezing it reassuringly. 
“I'll keep it short, ok?”

In the blink of an eye the world around us began to change, the haze from before not only reforming the wall as if creating a projection, but rather the entire world around us. In mere moments, our table sat in a dense jungle, an intrusion of civilization in the wilderness. I immediately felt the hot lick of heat and humidity running up my back. These trees were different than before, denser and much greener– like seeing foreign plants from a different world. Just then, I saw a familiar sight, a man sprawled out on the ground bleeding. 
“Spectre Actual, this is Red Fox One. We have been overrun! It was a damn trap! Unknown number M.I.A Seven K.I.A. I repeat, seven men down.” The man screamed into his radio, blood oozing from his thigh. He gritted his teeth as he spoke.

“Mark my position—Grid 11-Delta-Charlie-7-2. Danger close. I say again—danger real close. Request immediate airstrike…” He hesitated for a moment, his voice quivering “—napalm.”

“Repeat Sir? That's your evac position, are you requesting we bomb your location?” The voice replied on the other side of the radio.

“Affirmative. I'm the only one left and the LZ is about to get really fucking hot in about 3 minutes... Tell 'em to send it right on top of me.”
“Affirmative. Godspeed, Sir” The radio operator replied for the last time.

The last thing I hear is a deafening sound surrounding me– like a jet engine blowing during an earthquake. My eardrums throbbed along with my pulse and I swore I could hear something else in the inferno. I closed my eyes and screamed; I screamed because…I can hear him scream.

When I opened my eyes again, I was back at the kitchen table, cookie in hand. Birds chirped happy songs outside, blissfully unaware. 
“That's where your dad died… and met me.""

Death said softly, a sadness crossing slowly over her face like the moon would in an eclipse. 
“Brave man… one of the bravest Howells I've seen and even he didn't have the courage to break that stupid deal,” she said, staring off into the distance. “He said he was too scared of burning–”

She choked on those last words and leaned back in her chair. I didn't need her to explain why that last part stung so badly.

“Often, the things you fear greatest have a way of coming back to you..” She added.

We sat for a moment or two, silence growing between us as we both stewed in thought– the visages of the dead men haunting both our minds. A weight settled in the air, disrupted only by the noises of nature continuing to filter in from the paradise outside. How I wish I could have just walked out there for a while among the vineyards.

“I'll speak plainly with you now dear, I want no fanfare around this deal. “ She hissed the last word like it tasted sour on her tongue before continuing, “You're a smart one, you've guessed by now that I expect you to be the one to break this thing.”

I gave a small nod as she leaned across the table, taking my hands into her own. Despite the dark skin stretched over her bones, I still felt them against my palms– hard and brittle, as if the skin was a facade to the real reaper hidden underneath.

“Then let me explain it plain and simple. When a Howell boy like you dies, they get a second chance as you've seen… but there is a price.”

“Death cannot leave empty handed, you see, even I am bound by certain rules. If a cycle isn’t already developed like in the case of your dad, I must take the father of the nearest child, leaving them a partial orphan.” She said in a joyless tone, “If anyone should know the sting of that loss my dear, it would be you.”

I opened my mouth to ask a question, but she waved her hand in a way that instantly made me go silent. My mouth felt dry and the allure of the deal now tasted acrid in my throat. 

“That's not all… Robbing a child of their father is only the superficial wound, the real cut festers deeper. The sickness spreads like all sicknesses do, through other people. You see, the Howell soul becomes bound to the child they left fatherless, haunting them daily with the void left behind. The dead Howell gets to resume their life only as long as the child is alive, connected like a parasite.”

The air seemed even heavier than before. I no longer heard the birds chirping outside with their cheerful tunes. Their calls were silent, as if they were listening with my same bated breath. I glanced quickly over to the window for a moment's peace, but low-rolling black storm clouds had begun marching in from a distant north.

“Then when the child grows and dies, they learn the truth. Just as you are now. ” She hesitated on her words quite often, as if she wanted me to dwell on every thought, like I needed to absorb everything.

“After learning the truth. They get the same decision you are getting but now against the Howell family instead– that’s what I meant by a cycle being in place. They can either stew in their fear… and hatred.” She said sharply, articulating her words like icy daggers. “Or let go of fear– forgive…letting the deal crumble, never to return.”

I sat there for a moment just trying to process before finally speaking, my voice cracking the silence like a lightly frozen river. A deep groaning thunder shook from the storm clouds that were approaching unnaturally fast.
“So that guy in the bar, the one who shot me, he's the one that killed my dad? He died, met you here, and got the same deal my father got? How did he recognize me then? Why was he carrying on about burning?""

“I showed him things I shouldn’t have…” She said with a quiet firmness, “I hoped that a different approach may change things... He was never supposed to run into you, that was an awful coincidence… but that doesn’t matter now. ”

Another roar of thunder growled outside with enough strength to shake the entire cottage. Lady Death’s eyes darted to the window before returning to me and she began to speak with a sudden haste.

“It was always a life for a life, Blake. Your dad just as readily robbed that man in the bar of his father many years ago. That day, he started the current cycle that has led right back to you.”
Death's attention was snatched away from our conversation with the sudden appearance of a visitor. A black crow flew in and perched on the windowsill of the glassless window. It was dark, almost void black in its appearance and I noticed its eyes peering into the scene like glowing sapphires. She turned back to me and continued, ignoring its presence.

“You will get more life… But it's uncertain and doomed from its first breath. The cycle just continues. Die as you're supposed to Blake– with grace,” Her eyes darted back to the crow once more and its beak fell down, releasing a low caw.

“This is important.” She said, pointing her finger at me, “Know that it's better to forgive, to realize we're all human as even I once was. Make the right choice, be the first to turn down the deal.”
The crow cawed again, a deep bellowing sort of caw that sounded more akin to a growl. I noticed now that Lady Death seemed to grow more than just frantic; she was panicked. With an almost robotic twitch of its neck, it locked its sapphire eye with her and pierced the silence of the room with a guttural bellow.

“Give me more time, demon!” She hissed, leaping up from her seat. The chair clattered to the floor with a loud thud as she took a firm rebellious stance.

I was taken aback. Lady Death had shown multiple emotions throughout our meeting: kindness, concern, dismay, and even anger, but all were muted in their intensity. Now, as the anger rippled off of her like waves of an angry tide, I could feel her aura pushing me into my seat with an unseen force. I doubted that I could even move an inch if I tried, but the crow on the other hand, sat unmoving on the windowsill, its beak sharp and pointed in the unnatural darkness that surrounded it. Before she could say anything else, the crow took flight, its black wings stretching out in a sickly display of grotesque protruding bone and tattered feathers. It arched left and hung right as it darted into the kitchen in its haphazard flight… and to my horror, that flight was right at me.

“NO!” Lady death shrieked as a sudden blinding light flashed from her hands, but she was too late, and the crow was too fast. It dug its talons into my skin and I felt red hot pain searing in my shoulders before a cold washed through my skin.

I opened my eyes once more and found that my surroundings had changed. In this world beyond death, I was nothing more than a leaf in a stream, being carried to place after place against a current I couldn’t hope to resist. Everything around me was dark and veiled by thick shadows that moved and swayed like grass in the wind and a bitter cold permeated my bones.

“She isn’t telling the whole truth, Blake.” A voice from deep in the void called, its tone deep and guttural. It sounded like it was sick, but the disease did little to affect its booming cadence. 
“Observe.”

Like spotlights on a massive stage, I watched as light flooded the expansive room ahead of me. Immediately I recognized the scene of Lady Death’s cottage. She was facing me, talking to someone at the same table I had sat at, but all I could glimpse was the back of his head. I tried to focus from afar, but it wasn’t much use as the shadowy distance between us created a sort of fog against my vision.

“Closer– Go to them.” The hidden voice bellowed, the bass making the world shake under my feet as he spoke, “Listen and Learn.” 
I didn’t dare disobey. I headed forward, navigating the cold empty darkness of the barren space until I reached the spotlit facade of Death’s cottage. As I grew closer, I found that my pace had slowed down to a crawl. I knew the man. I knew his voice as anger bubbled up in his throat. It was the man from the bar. Bill, that was his name. She had explained this part, the “cycle”– so what was her deception? I turned my head toward the nothingness of the void, looking for my dark captor.

“Burn him. I want him to burn just like my dad did.”

Suddenly the overbearing weight of the black shadowed room seemed lighter than anything else as my heart grew heavy. I spun back around to the table and caught the face of the man from the bar, his eyes alight with a hatred I had seen a few times throughout my career as a police officer. That look meant someone was going to suffer.

“Are you sure? You don’t really want to do that? You choose how he dies, why not just make it quick..?” Lady Death muttered in that same disarming, scolding tone she used on me.

“No.” He spat, “I want him to burn.”

“Then it will be done.”

Memories of my childhood home flashed into my mind and I wasn’t sure if my mind was just exceptionally cruel, or if the demon had a hand in this, but all I could remember was that damn basement door with the beam leaned up against it. Metal banged against the wood, knocking hard enough to cause splinters to rain down onto the linoleum below. I want him to burn. The words echoed in my mind and I heard screams penetrate my ears– my dad’s screams– just beyond the door. Hotter and hotter the flames burned. Burn him. I want him to burn. The screams crescendoed in my ears. The desperate thrashing against the door grew heavier, more frantic, and I swear I could hear him begging. Then it will be done.

I shut my eyes so tight I felt the pressure pulling at every part of me. The rage and hatred swirled with all my regret and loss until it made a painful and volatile concoction within me. And then… the words just fell out of me, pooling out like a river that just burst through its dam.

“I want him to burn too… I want him to suffer like my dad did,” I screamed.

When I opened my eyes, I was no longer in the dark room, I was back at the table with Lady Death. She sighed weakly and looked away defeated, but it was too late, the words had already been said.

“Then it will be done.”
_
The first thing I noticed was the slow rhythmic beeping and warm fabric pressed against my body, swaddling me all the way up to my chin. I knew where I was, Bakersfield hospital. The room slowly revealed itself to me like an unveiled painting as familiarity wrapped me like the hospital blankets. I rolled over to my phone sitting on the nearby nightstand and saw a large Moth Orchid flower sitting beside it, its pink petals fluttering softly above the white ‘Get Well Soon’ card nestled among its leaves. The bottom was signed by John.

I clicked the button on the side of the phone and the screen came to life, illuminating both me and the quiet little hospital room I found myself in. June 17th. It had been almost 35 days since what happened back in that bar. That realization hit me hard and I jolted upright in my bed, pulling the cables to the heart monitor taut before yanking them straight out of the electrodes. A shrieking beep filled the room as the monitor screamed that I was flatlining. I struggled with my gown and eventually tore it off, flinging it to the floor. A large wad of gauze and staunch white medical tape stretched over my torso like I was an Egyptian mummy. It was true then. I really died and met Death. Right?

“No… no no no.” I muttered softly as I pulled my weak corpse of a body from the hospital bed. 

Sitting on a dresser in the corner of the room was an empty, paper coffee mug. Beside it, draped haphazardly across the arm of a wooden chair, I saw a newspaper that was in the middle of being read. John must have stopped by, and he must have left in a hurry. I picked up the paper and began tearing through the pages until to my surprise, my answer was plastered all over the front page. 
‘Local Hero Cop Survives Dangerous Shooting.’ I read the headline and put my finger on the page, dragging it down with a trembling digit. ‘The suspect reportedly set himself on fire and succumbed to his injuries at the scene.’

“Oh, God…”

A pit immediately began in my stomach, swallowing more and more of me from within. Guilt came first, harsh and sickly like a poison; then regret followed right after. I wish I could say those were the feelings that lingered the longest. I wish I could say that those feelings etched onto my soul, but no, they faded and morphed in my heart until I noticed something else. The heart monitor– it was still beeping its long and high pitched shrills. I would have thought that somebody would have come and checked by now.

As I was about to turn to the door, something caught my eye on the next page of the newspaper. I came across another article circled with deep crimson ink. My blood ran cold. ‘Possible Connection, I read. Son of Deceased Shooting Perpetrator Found At Apartment in Critical Condition. Outlook is Grim According to Medical Professionals.’
Throwing the newspaper back on the chair with a shiver, I crept across the room until I reached the massive wooden door, navigating the dimly lit floor with an outstretched hand. The air felt cold, ice cold, and if I had more light to see, I could have sworn I would have seen my breath leading ahead of me. Finally, I gripped the door’s metallic handle and pulled. Nothing. It didn’t budge.

“What the hell?!” I yelled, before banging my fist against the door, “Nurse?!”

My breath hitched in my throat and my healed heart began pounding inside my chest. They had no reason to lock the door,  not for me. I knocked harder this time, my knuckles aching from the impact. Nothing still… nothing until something knocked back. The knocks were achingly slow and each seemed to echo more than normal.

Knock. Knooock. Knoooock.

I took a step back from the door but not because it was about to open, no. I felt something else deep in my gut, an immense aura like I had once felt in that shadowy world of the crow. It was impossible, I was back in the real world, so it had to be nerves. A long cool bead of sweat ran down my forehead, slipping past my temple.

“H-Hello? John?” I said after a few moments, mustering courage to aid my skepticism.
The door answered back unceremoniously with two more slow knocks.

Another bead of sweat ran down my head and I found myself completely frozen in place. It seemed as if the hospital floor itself had dug into my feet in an endeavour to keep me there. Images of Death’s cottage flashed into mind and I longed for a place that once again felt warm and welcoming. How I’d love to see a friendly face again.

The fantasy left my mind like wisps of smoke through my fingers. I coughed hard, my throat suddenly stinging like I had gulped liquor. A familiar scent wafted through the air. I knew what it was… That scent was a part of me, like bones making up the parts of a body. The air wasn’t ice cold any longer, I just hadn’t noticed. The sweat running down my back wasn’t just from fear. When I finally spun around, it was there just like I knew it would be– like it was fated to be. In another hospital, Bill’s son had died.

The glowing red and yellow fingers of the fire curled up the wall in a ballet of all consuming destruction. It was hot and pure and boundless, lingering far beyond the confines of this hospital room. Its reflection once more flickered off my eyes and I felt like a kid again, watching with that same helplessness.
Behind me the door knocked again loudly, no longer slow and lingering like before, but hard and deliberate. Panicked just like my father. I didn’t answer. Of course I didn’t, I never would. The flames crept forward, guided not by its nature, but by a greater power than itself. The heat sucked the air from the room, taking my breath with it as the flames arched, poised like a tiger about to leap. I watched, eyeing it like a rabbit eyes a wolf as it’s pressed into a corner. The occasional knocks had become more and more rapid, thudding just beyond my perception. My death wouldn’t be slow.
“Blake…. Blake…!” A voice screamed over the roaring flames and the ceaseless banging against the hospital room door. It was my dad, but this time he wasn’t trying to get out. He was trying to get in.

Caught in a trance, I took a step forward to the inferno. No more running. Tears and sweat mingled in a salty dance as they poured off of me onto the floor below. A flaming hand eased from the inferno, beckoning me toward it with a wave of its devilish clawed fingers. I started to reach back. It was pointless… fate was here and I would have to answer to Lady Death.

An immense force impacted against my back and I went sprawling forward to the ground. I would have screamed had I had the opportunity, but the last remnants of breath was knocked out of my lungs and I laid on the floor in a daze. The floor felt cool against my cheek, like a comforting hand as I slowly turned my blurred vision to the culprit of the sudden attack. Short black hair, strong unrelenting body, a small bounce in his steps. It was John. I opened my mouth but only breathy gasps escaped my smoke filled lungs.
My peripherals filled with fog and small black dots, but I fought to stay conscious. John struggled against the flames. His shirt burned and his arms scorched in the flames, melting almost like candle wax, but he stayed silent. He fought. I tried to do more, to wrestle against the fading, but it was all in vain. The last thing I saw was John roaring and yanking a fiery arm toward the once closed door.

“Thank God! You're awake!” Poor Paulie screamed joyfully, snatching my hand from the bedside chairs. Tears had welled up in the corner of his eyes.

“I thought you was a goner! I'm closing that damn bar.. Err– well what's left of it!” Poor Paulie continued on as a nurse nudged past him. It was apparent he wouldn't be letting either of us get a word in edgewise. I was too preoccupied to listen anyway.

“John? Where's John at?” I said finally, cutting through Poor Paulie's banter.

“Johnny boy? I haven't seen em in a day or two actually. Why?” he replied.

Something had plagued me as I flipped through the newspaper, something that I hadn't noticed at first. The corner of the back few pages were blackened– burnt almost like it was held to a flame, and then the char just stopped. It never knew how close it was to being consumed. 
“Just.. Please tell him to call me when you see him.” I replied, searching for an adequate answer and coming up short.
_
I'm home now, cleaned up and sitting at my table like usual, though it's decorated by a few more whisky bottles than it used to be. After another week inside the hospital they let me go. 
“It was miraculous,” they said, “the bullet missed your heart by less than an inch. You're one lucky man!”

I'm sure now that it wasn't luck that stopped that bullet from entering my heart, it was that devil's deal, and by all rights I should have burned in that room by that very same agreement. Fate and its cruel irony had meant to drag me down to Hell for what I did… and yet I'm still here. I wonder what Lady Death is thinking, if she's going to send for me anytime soon. I'm not out of the fire, just enjoying the time John bought me.

I haven't seen John since whatever happened in the hospital. He hasn't shown up to work and his home is empty. The little bit of material possessions he had are still sitting untouched, collecting dust. It's like he simply just vanished without a trace.

I grabbed the card that still sat next to the moth orchid on my table. The flower had withered slightly, its bud drooping low as if bowing in respect. I flipped the bright card in my hands, the big colorful words “Get Well Soon” stare back at me with a positivity I struggle to reciprocate. I open it up once more and stare at the words.

You'll have to buy me a cup of coffee that's actually worth a damn for this. Happy late Birthday, John Meyer.

As I turned the card over in my hands, something slipped out of a small paper compartment in the back, probably meant for a gift card. It was strange, an ethereal glowing piece of alabaster fabric that was warm to the touch. A shred of Death’s cloak.

I smile, slowly reading the note again. Indeed I will John, indeed I will. When I find you. ",1,1767730497.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1q5tlmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/NootropicsDepot/comments/1q5tlmi/stack_advice_endurance_athlete_testosterone/,"Stack Advice: Endurance Athlete, Testosterone, Immunity, Sleep, Mental Tasks","I’d love some feedback, advice, and/or critiques on my current stack. My primary focus is endurance/long-distance running: I run 4–5 times a week, 25–40 miles per week, regularly running marathons and ultramarathons. Secondary physical focus is strength training (2x/week to support my running). I also work a demanding office job. I don’t typically struggle with “turning it on” on long focus days, but I would be interested in something to enhance that (besides my usual caffeine).

My main goals are:

* Endurance/running support 
* Lowering blood pressure (family history)
* General immunity support (I used to get sick a lot)
* Sleep support (occasional issues, plus always looking to maximize this for running and, well, everything else)
* Gut health

I’ve historically felt like a nonresponder to a lot of supplements, with TauroMag being a big exception. I love TauroMag - acute sense of relaxation, improved subjective sleep and metrics. Definitely a ""forever"" supp for me. My overall goal is to find a “core” stack that works really well for my body chemistry (like TauroMag) while keeping costs generally low. Right now, my stack is too many pills for my preference, plain and simple, and a little pricey.

Also, I’m already a naturally confident and occasionally aggressive person, so I’m not interested in anything that’s likely to crank that up further. I’m very keen on healthy testosterone support, though, given all the running and knowing that's a catabolic activity. I’m 33, 180 lbs.

Here's my current stack. 

**Daily in the morning:**

* Vit D/MK7
* MicroZinc
* Carlyle Hibiscus Flower (noticeable BP lowering. I wish ND stocked this; I’d buy it in a heartbeat)
* Epicor
* Psyllium husk
* Caffeine (coffee) + L-theanine
* Viva Naturals Fish Oil (I like the high EPA for inflammation/triglycerides support, tho I’m likely going to pivot to ND fish oil, ND NKO krill oil, or Kori krill oil. I haven’t decided yet, but I’m leaning toward trying krill oil.)
* Infini-B (just added, trialing it out)
* CoQsol-CF (just added, trialing it out)

**Daily at night:**

* Mag glycinate
* TauroMag
* Apigenin (just added, trialing it out)

**As needed:**

* Immune Defense. I use this when traveling, I’m around those who are sick, or I feel something coming on. This seems to work like magic. I swear by this supp and have a hunch I should potentially take it daily/near daily and cut out MicroZinc/Epicor and replace with this.
* NAC before drinking
* KSM-66 if stressed (very rarely used, don't love it; will prob not replace when I run out)
* Sleep Support. Full dose seems to wreck my sleep. Talking with u/Pretty-Chill, I've been trialing it out as a mid-day/early evening anxiolytic with some success! So, still figuring this one out, but tentatively, it seems to work well when stressed/need to relax after a long work day.

**Currently testing (unsure):**

* Tongkat Ali 2% (felt acute effects early that tapered off; honeymoon period?)
* Full-Spectrum Cistanche (not sure I feel much, though I do think I feel more hunger)
* Horny Goat Weed 50%: Intention is to balance out the tongkat and increase libido. One relevant (potentially TMI!) data point: I tried HGW as a one-time thing before sex with my partner and had the longest erection I’ve had in quite some time. I’d obviously like to keep that benefit, but I’m concerned about long-term HGW usage on its own (i.e., if it needs to be paired with something like tongkat). 50% daily is also too costly for me, and it's hard to identify if the HGW was the primary driver of libido/erection quality.

**Tried and didn't feel effects:**

* Infinigreens: I actually very much enjoyed this, but I didn’t have substantially different effects than just psyllium husk, so I’m discontinuing due to cost.
* Tart cherry: Intention was to promote workout recovery and maybe improve sleep. Just not noticing anything.
* Lemon balm: Oddly, I don’t notice anything with this, despite reacting so strongly to Sleep Support.
* Quercefit: Maybe it enhanced my immune system? I'm not sure. Didn't feel anything acute, and I seem to be equally immune to illness from epicor + Vit D with occasional Immune Defense use. I think.
* Nigella sativa: Same as Quercefit.

**Interested in trying:**

* Citicoline or Alpha-GPC: Before long runs based on a running pre-workout I trust - [EndurElite Perform Elite](https://nutrabio.com/collections/endurelite-prep/products/perform-elite) \- and on long work days; slight concern because I've read about clotting concerns with choline and I have a mild clotting disorder, nothing crazy but still need to be aware.
* Tribugen/Cistamax/Eurycomax: I’d love to do them all, but financially that’s not sustainable right now. Would really appreciate advice on which might fit best for my goals/background (lots of running; want to avoid being more aggressive).
* Cordyceps (10:1 or full fruiting body): I’m skeptical about endurance benefits tbh (if it’s that magical, why aren’t elites taking it?) but curious.
* Infinilyte: I’m curious about this for obvious sweaty reasons, but I’m also skeptical this can’t be achieved via Lite Salt (which I already use and contains sodium, potassium, and iodine) plus an affordable trace minerals supp like Life Extension Only Trace Minerals. But maybe I’m overlooking something?

Thanks in advance for reading and any thoughts! I’ve been scouring this sub for anecdotes and experiences, but I haven’t seen many long-distance runners here and am curious for opinions based on the context above. I also may not be seeing interactions that others might. Let me know if I can format this any better for readability.",1,1767730443.0,NootropicsDepot,0,1.0,False

Because of that, I want to start hosting monthly daytime hangouts for people who prefer socializing earlier in the day.

Creeds Coffee Bar actually reached out to me to keep hosting these, so we’re doing another one.

Right now, tickets are free, and there are plenty available, but I do want to mention that the last one filled up quickly.

Event Details

Location: Creeds Coffee Bar, 450 Dupont St, Toronto

Date: Saturday, November 29

Time: 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM

Free Limited Tickets : https://www.eventbrite.com/e/daytime-social-by-social-creatues-tickets-1979896507752?aff=oddtdtcreator

Creeds is a great Toronto coffee spot with lots of space, good coffee, and a relaxed daytime vibe. It’s bright, comfortable, and easy to get to, which makes it perfect for a low key social meetup.

This is a casual daytime hang focused on meeting people without pressure. We do light icebreakers and simple games to make conversations easy. Most people come solo, and it usually stops feeling awkward pretty quickly.

Just a reminder that this is not a dating event.

If you prefer daytime plans, enjoy coffee, or want to meet new people in a relaxed way, this is probably for you.

Tickets are free right now but will go up and I need get a headcount for the venue.

1q5ti5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/1q5ti5w/autistic_at_17m_raped_by_my_sisters_friend_19f/,"Autistic, at 17(m), raped by my sister’s friend 19(f)","I’m a guy and I’m high functioning/masking autistic, and I have a really hard time reading social situations and knowing what’s “normal” vs not. I’ve been carrying this for years.
When I was 17 (M), my older sister’s best friend 19(F) was basically living at our house. My dad even called her “another daughter.” She was always over, came on family outings, and slept in my sister’s room. Over time my sister was spending more nights at her friend’s place, while her friend stayed at ours.
I thought of her as my sisters friend. Kinda like another sibling. We would go shopping, to movies, swimming, beach days.... I didn’t drink, but I smoked a lot of weed. She drank and partied a lot. Sometimes on weekends we’d hang out and talk about anything and everything. Other weekends she’d go out with my sister to party, and I’d be home high, watching TV or playing games. We never kissed or held hands or called it dating. I honestly thought we were just people who did activities together.
I often fall asleep on the couch in the living room. When she came home drunk, she would come in through the sliding glass door, slap me awake, tell me to go to my room, and then go upstairs to sleep in my sister’s room. This happened a lot. I didn’t like being slapped, but I just accepted it as “her thing” and moved on.
Important context: I was raised Baptist and was waiting until marriage to have sex. I don’t know when she started to like me that way. Because I’m autistic and bad at reading signals, I honestly couldn’t tell.
One night she and my sister went out drinking. I fell asleep on the couch like usual. She came in through the sliding door and slapped me like always. I was half asleep, really out of it. This time, instead of just telling me to go to my room, she reached up the leg of my shorts, took out my limp penis, and started sucking it. I drifted in and out of sleep while she did that. Eventually I got hard.
She was wearing a dress. She moved her panties aside and put just the tip of me inside her. I was still mostly out of it. She slapped me again and again until I was fully awake. When I finally really woke up, I realized I was hard and the tip of my penis was inside her. She smiled at me, put all of me in her and started riding me.
I had a really split reaction. Part of me wanted it to stop, because I’d planned to wait for marriage and I didn’t understand what was happening or how we got there. At the same time, the physical feeling of the wetness and tightness around the tip felt good. When I tried to push myself up, she took my hands and put them on her chest and kept going. She started moaning loudly and then put her tongue in my mouth. I did have a female friend that wanted to practice kissing, that was concentual. 
I never said “yes.” I never asked for this. I was half asleep, high, and this was my sister’s best friend who everyone treated like family. I also struggle with social cues and responding in the moment, so I kind of froze and went along with it, even though a big part of me didn’t want it.
After a while I ended up finishing inside her. She kept riding me until her legs started to shake and then she fell on top of me. She kissed me, then went down, licked me clean and kissed the tip, put me back in my shorts like it was nothing, told me to go sleep in my room, and went upstairs to my sister’s room. I just did what I was told, went to my room and went back to sleep.
The next morning I woke up and went to the kitchen. My dad used to always call me “his boy,” but that morning he poured me a coffee, made me breakfast, and called me “a grown man.” I’m pretty sure he heard what happened the night before. Nobody knew it was rape. I did. I just kept it to myself and felt weirdly indifferent about.",1,1767730235.0,rape,1,1.0,False

In this guide, we’ll explore various techniques and tips to help you create a morning meditation routine that works for you.

# Key Takeaways

https://preview.redd.it/6w3y4bsx7sbg1.png?width=200&format=png&auto=webp&s=6974d995acf9aae59780aa754a52f6b86985748b

* Morning meditation can clear your mind and reduce anxiety.
* Setting intentions during meditation can help you stay focused throughout the day.
* Creating a peaceful environment enhances your meditation experience.
* Movement-based meditation can energize your body and mind.
* Consistency is key to reaping the full benefits of morning meditation.

# Embracing Morning Meditation: A Path to Clarity

Morning meditation? It might sound like something only monks do, but trust me, it's way more accessible than you think. It's about carving out a little slice of peace before the day grabs you by the collar. Think of it as hitting the 'reset' button before your day even begins. It's not about emptying your mind (good luck with that!), but more about gently guiding your thoughts and finding a sense of calm amidst the chaos. Let's explore how this simple practice can seriously change your day.

# Understanding the Benefits of Morning Meditation

Okay, so what's the big deal? Why should you bother waking up a few minutes earlier? The benefits are excellent. For starters, it's a fantastic stress reliever. Instead of starting your day already feeling overwhelmed, you can approach it with a sense of calm and control. Meditation can also boost your focus and concentration, making you more productive throughout the day. Plus, it's a great way to cultivate *mindfulness*, helping you to be more present and appreciative of the little things. It's like giving your brain a little spa day before it has to deal with emails, meetings, and all the other craziness of modern life.

# How Morning Meditation Enhances Your Day

Imagine starting your day feeling centered and grounded, instead of rushing around like a headless chicken. That's the power of morning meditation. It sets the tone for the entire day, influencing your mood, energy levels, and overall well-being. When you meditate in the morning, you're training your brain to respond to stress more balancedly. This can lead to better decision-making, improved relationships, and a greater sense of overall happiness. It's like laying a strong foundation for a successful, fulfilling day.

# Creating a Mindful Morning Environment

Setting the stage for your morning meditation is key. You don't need a fancy meditation room or expensive equipment. Just a quiet, comfortable space where you can relax and focus. Maybe it's a corner of your bedroom, a cozy chair in the living room, or even a spot in your garden. The important thing is to minimize distractions and foster an atmosphere of calm and tranquility. Consider these:

* Dim the lights or use natural light.
* Play soft, calming music or nature sounds.
* Use aromatherapy with essential oils like lavender or chamomile.

# Simple Techniques for Effective Morning Meditation

It's easy to feel overwhelmed when starting a meditation practice, but don't worry! There are simple, practical techniques you can use to make the most of your morning meditation. The key is to find what works best for you and to be patient with yourself as you learn. Remember, it's a journey, not a race.

# Breath Awareness: The Foundation of Meditation

Breath awareness is a cornerstone of many meditation practices. **It's a simple yet powerful way to anchor yourself in the present moment.** You can start by finding a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down. Gently close your eyes and bring your attention to your breath. Notice the sensation of the air entering and leaving your body. You might feel it in your nostrils, your chest, or your abdomen. As you focus on your breath, thoughts will inevitably arise. That's okay! Acknowledge them without judgment and gently redirect your attention back to your breath. Focus on [proper meditation techniques](https://www.mindful.org/how-to-meditate/) to improve your practice.

# Guided Meditations for Beginners

*Guided meditations* can be a fantastic way to ease into meditation, especially if you're new to the practice. These meditations typically involve a narrator who guides you through visualizations, affirmations, or breathing exercises. They can help you stay focused and provide a structure for your meditation session. There are countless guided meditations available online, through apps, or even in person. Experiment with different styles and voices to find one that resonates with you.

# Incorporating Movement into Your Practice

https://preview.redd.it/3dp0s4xk9sbg1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=df03470d8f908cb202eceba1aed8566da76aec35

Meditation doesn't always have to be still. Incorporating gentle movement into your practice can be a great way to release tension and connect with your body. Consider trying *mindfulness practices for beginners*, such as yoga, tai chi, or a simple walk in nature. As you move, pay attention to the sensations in your body. Notice how your feet feel on the ground, how your muscles feel as they stretch, and how your breath flows with your movement. This can help you cultivate a more profound sense of body awareness and presence. Here are some ideas:

* Gentle stretching
* Walking meditation
* Yoga or Tai Chi

Remember, the goal is not to achieve perfect stillness, but to cultivate awareness and presence in whatever you do. Try [guided meditation for a positive start](https://www.mindful.org/how-to-meditate/) to your day.

# Crafting Your Personalized Morning Meditation Routine

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XePLk6PM9E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XePLk6PM9E)



It's time to make meditation *your* thing. Forget generic advice; let's tailor a routine that fits your life like a glove. It's all about finding what works for you, so don't be afraid to experiment.

# Choosing the Right Time for Meditation

Okay, so when *should* you meditate? There's no magic hour, despite what gurus might say. Think about your schedule. Are you a morning person? Great, aim for right after you wake up, before the chaos begins. More of a night owl? A short session before bed is better. The key is consistency. Pick a time you can realistically stick to, even if it's just for five minutes. Don't overthink it. If you can only squeeze it in during your [morning routine checklist](https://journeythroughmeditation.com/blog/2025/3/16/quick-amp-effective-morning-meditation-hacks), that's perfectly fine.

# Setting Intentions for Your Day

**Setting intentions is like giving your day a compass.** It's not about making a to-do list; it's about deciding how you want to *be*. Do you want to be more patient? More focused? More grateful? Take a moment during your meditation to visualize yourself embodying that quality. Feel it in your body. This simple act can powerfully shape your actions throughout the day. It's a game changer, trust me.

# Finding Your Ideal Meditation Space

Your meditation space doesn't need to be fancy. It doesn't need to be a zen garden. It just needs to be a place where you feel relatively calm and undisturbed. It could be a corner of your bedroom, a comfy chair, or even a spot in your backyard. The important thing is to minimize distractions. Turn off your phone, tell your family you need a few minutes of peace, and create an environment that supports your practice.

# Overcoming Common Challenges in Morning Meditation

https://preview.redd.it/5jq7nt7bcsbg1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=8dfd930ddebe36e0247552a47d17aba9c0a75253

# Dealing with Distractions and Interruptions

Okay, let's be real. Life is noisy. Your phone buzzes, the dog barks, your brain decides 6 AM is the perfect time to replay that awkward conversation from 2010. It happens! **The key isn't to eliminate distractions entirely (impossible!), but to change how you react to them.** When a distraction pops up, acknowledge it without judgment. Think of it like a cloud passing in the sky. Notice it, and then gently guide your attention back to your breath or your [meditation focus](https://megreynolds.com/blog/overcoming-common-challenges-in-meditation-practice/). Don't beat yourself up about it; keep practicing. Try noise-canceling headphones or a white-noise app if external sounds are a big issue. And let your family know you need a few minutes of quiet time – communication is key!

# Staying Consistent with Your Practice

Ugh, consistency. We all struggle with it. One day you're a meditation master, the next you're hitting snooze three times and rushing out the door. The trick is to make it as easy as possible to stick with it. Start small. Really small. Like, two minutes small. It's way easier to commit to two minutes than 30. Then, link your meditation to something you already do every morning, like brushing your teeth or making coffee. This creates a *habit* loop. Also, prepare your space the night before. Set out your cushion, dim the lights, whatever makes it easier to sit down and meditate. And remember, missing a day (or even a week) isn't a failure. Just start again.

* Start small (2-5 minutes).
* Link it to an existing habit.
* Prepare your space the night before.

# Managing Expectations and Progress

Meditation isn't a magic bullet. You're not going to achieve enlightenment overnight (sorry!). It's a practice, and like any practice, it takes time and effort to see results. Don't expect to feel instantly calm and blissful every time you meditate. Some days will be easier than others. Some days you might feel more anxious or restless than before you started. That's okay! It's all part of the process.

# Exploring Different Styles of Morning Meditation

Okay, so you're getting into the swing of things with morning meditation, that's awesome! Now, let's talk about spicing things up a bit. There's a whole world of different meditation styles out there, and finding one that really clicks with you can make all the difference. It's like finding the perfect coffee blend. Once you find it, your mornings are just *better*. Let's explore some options:

# Mindfulness Meditation for Everyday Life

Mindfulness meditation is all about being present. It's super practical because you can apply it to pretty much anything you do. **You're training your brain to focus on the** ***now*****, rather than getting caught up in worries about the future or regrets about the past.** When you're brushing your teeth, focus on the sensation of the bristles. When you're walking, notice how your feet feel on the ground. It sounds simple, but it's incredibly powerful. You can use [mindfulness exercises](https://positivepsychology.com/mindfulness-exercises-techniques-activities/) throughout the day to stay grounded.

# Loving-Kindness Meditation for Positivity

This one's a real heart-opener. Loving-kindness meditation involves sending positive vibes out into the world, starting with yourself. You repeat phrases like, ""May I be happy, may I be healthy, may I be safe, may I be at ease."" Then, you extend those wishes to people you care about, then to neutral people, then to difficult people, and finally to all beings. It might sound a little cheesy, but it's incredible how it can shift your perspective and cultivate a sense of connection and compassion. It's like giving your heart a warm hug first thing in the morning.

# Movement-Based Meditations for Energy

If sitting still isn't your thing, movement-based meditations might be perfect for you. Think yoga, tai chi, or even just a mindful walk. The idea is to combine physical activity with mental focus. You're paying attention to your breath and your body's sensations as you move. This can be a great way to wake up your body and mind at the same time, especially if you're feeling sluggish. It's like hitting the reset button before your day even begins.

# Integrating Morning Meditation into Your Daily Life

It's one thing to understand the benefits of morning meditation, and another actually to make it a consistent part of your day. Let's explore how to seamlessly weave this practice into the fabric of your life, ensuring it becomes a sustainable and enjoyable habit.

# Creating a Supportive Community

Meditation doesn't have to be a solitary activity. In fact, connecting with others can significantly boost your commitment and enjoyment. Consider these options:

* **Join a local meditation group:** Search online or check community centers for groups in your area. Meeting in person can provide a sense of accountability and shared experience.
* **Find an online community:** Numerous online forums and groups are dedicated to meditation. These can offer support, advice, and shared experiences, no matter where you are.
* **Buddy up with a friend:** Partner with someone also interested in meditation. You can check in with each other, share tips, and keep each other motivated. This is a great way to [start your day with meditation](https://flourishcounselingmd.com/mindfulness-practices-in-daily-routine/).

# Tracking Your Progress and Growth

It's easy to lose sight of how far you've come. Tracking your progress can provide motivation and help you identify areas for improvement. Here's how:

* **Keep a meditation journal:** After each session, jot down how you felt, any challenges you encountered, and any insights you gained. Reviewing your journal regularly can reveal patterns and highlight your growth.
* **Use a meditation app:** Many apps offer features to track your meditation time, frequency, and even your mood. This data can provide a visual representation of your progress.
* **Reflect regularly:** Take some time each week or month to reflect on your meditation journey. Ask yourself how it's impacting your life, what you're learning, and what you want to focus on moving forward.

# Celebrating Your Meditation Journey

It's important to acknowledge and celebrate your commitment to meditation. This reinforces the practice's positive aspects and keeps you motivated. Here are some ideas:

* **Reward yourself:** After reaching a milestone (e.g., meditating consistently for a month), treat yourself to something you enjoy. This could be anything from a relaxing bath to a new book.
* **Acknowledge your progress:** Take time to appreciate how far you've come. Notice the positive changes in your mood, focus, and overall well-being. **Recognizing these benefits will reinforce your commitment to the practice.**
* **Share your experiences:** Talk to friends or family about your meditation journey. Sharing your insights and successes can be a rewarding experience and may even inspire others to try it.

# The Transformative Power of Morning Meditation

# Real-Life Success Stories

You know, it's easy to read about meditation and think, ""Yeah, that sounds nice,"" but the real magic happens when you hear from people just like you who've actually felt the *benefits of morning mindfulness*. I've heard stories from friends who were constantly stressed, juggling work and family, and feeling totally burned out. They started with just five minutes of meditation each morning and, over time, noticed a huge difference. One friend even said it was like hitting a reset button every day, allowing her to approach challenges with a clearer head and a calmer heart. It's not a quick fix, but it's a powerful tool for long-term well-being.

# How Meditation Influences Mood and Energy

Ever wonder why some days you wake up feeling ready to conquer the world, while other days you can barely drag yourself out of bed? A lot of it has to do with your mental state. Morning meditation can be a game changer here. **It helps regulate your nervous system, reducing feelings of anxiety and stress.** By taking even a few minutes to center yourself, you're telling your body that it's safe and calm, which can lead to a more positive mood and sustained energy throughout the day. It's like giving yourself a little boost before the day even begins.

# Building Resilience Through Daily Practice

Life throws curveballs; that's just a fact. But how you react to those challenges makes all the difference. Daily meditation isn't about avoiding problems; it's about building resilience so you can handle them with grace and strength. Think of it as mental training. The more you practice, the better you become at staying grounded and centered, even when things get tough. It's like having an anchor in the storm, helping you weather any situation with a sense of calm and clarity.

1q5t9r2,https://i.redd.it/wi3xwqg2csbg1.png,Are some cats just bottomless pits or am I feeding my cats wrong?,"For background: I grew up with cats and we always free fed them. At my home now, we started with 2 adult cats that like to free feed. They did not get into our food, were well behaved, and held steady healthy weights.

Last year we adopted two brothers around 6 months old. At first, we free fed them also. They ballooned. One of them is 17lbs.. The vet said she didn't want them to lose ""too much weight"" because they are just bigger cats. Since we watched them grow, idk what weight they *should* be naturally. They are tabby cats and I highly doubt the boys could be mixed with a special breed like Maine Coon, which the vet did say one of their faces looked a little Main Coon. I'm sure the local stray gene pool is not getting mixed with expensive breads..

We've been weighing their food (Farmina N&D dry food) based on the bag's recommended amounts and very, very slowly lowering the amount. After many months, they've lost a little weight and we've stopped lowering the amount, but they have suddenly started to get into EVERYTHING. Our food. Stored treats. Stored bags of dry food.

I'm wondering if they really *are* that hungry and if we've been underfeeding them, or if it's more likely that their change in behavior is from our behaviors. During the recent holidays, they probably were concerned when we were gone most of the day and condensed their 4 meal times into 2 or 3. Sometimes people fall asleep on the couch with their leftover food on the coffee table.. The cats have become scavengers for our leftovers. And now that we've implemented loose meal times, *all* of the cats think every time we stand up, it's time to eat. One of the OG cats only eats wet food (expensive), so we let the other cats lick the gravy and finish the bits when she's done. Logically it makes sense to share the nutrients and not let anything go to waste, but it's only made their scavenger behavior worse. To be fair, it's probably confusing for them to see the other cats get fed more times, but that is only so they don't starve themselves under-eating. Now the boys just started *constantly* getting into the aforementioned stored food. **Everyone's behavior is all fucked up now.** Even my skinny cat with a low appetite is begging 24/7.. just to nibble, walk away, then come back 10 minutes later yelling because the bowl is picked up.


Help me, I've lost control. 😅

1q5t8nq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAGerman/comments/1q5t8nq/i_can_transfer_to_germany_or_austria_trying_to/,"I can transfer to Germany or Austria, trying to narrow it down...","SO SORRY for the giant wall of info, I know from combing through these subs that a lot of time the answer to these types of questions are very situation-dependent, so I wanted to offer up what I think may be relevant 😬.

I am a first generation German American with duel citizenship. I've been living in Portugal for the past 3 years but my company also has offices in Germany and Austria, and I recently found out that I can easily transfer to either one. I have visited both countries, feel very ""at home"" culturally in both, still speak German at an A2 level despite not having taken German classes since high school (but I'm currently taking private lessons twice a week, watching German TV, listening to German podcasts, etc, to increase my fluency).  I'm doing some scouting trips to both countries staring next month,  but would love some perspectives on living on Germany as a citizen vs in Austria as an EU Citizen/Resident, as well as if my research so far seems accurate?

About me: Mid 40s, childfree, boyfriend is a Portuguese citizen. I'm politically very progressive,  have fantasy colored hair, facial piercings, and have a lot of tattoos.  I have two (lazy) well-behaved dogs (small min pin mix and large greyhound). I work for an international software company with offices in multiple countries, and my salary will be adjusted accordingly when I move. I work in a niche, senior level role that's fairly high demand and have a decade of experience in another niche area, so I have good job security overall (as much as anyone can these days, anyway).  I will get private healthcare provided through my company and am healthy, active, and have no mobility issues. I'm not gonna be rich by any means, but my salary will be aligned with industry standard wherever I decide to live. 

I don't have a car and don't want one - public transit, walking, biking are all high priority for me.  I prefer cold and overcast weather (I'm a polar bear), mild/short summers that aren't overly humid (I'd rather have hot and dry than warm and humid).  I love weird, quirky museums (like the Funeral Museum and Museum of Reproductive Care in Vienna!), natural history museums, watching rugby, enjoying green spaces, swimming (pool and freshwater) skating (I played roller derby on and off for over a decade in the states). I like a nice wine bar, cocktail lounge, or coffee shop, not really into nightclubs/regular bars.

I prefer living in smaller, less dense cities or on the outskirts/suburbs of larger cities, as long as I have all of the things I need for daily life (grocery store, pharmacy, gym, etc), good transit, walkable/bikeable streets, and access to green space nearby. My ultimate goal would be to eventually buy a townhome, duplex, or small house with a garden.

I already have a good friend in Austria who offered to meet up and help me with apartment hunting and any translation help I may need. I'm looking at Vienna (suburbs/outer districts), Linz, and Gratz.  I've been to Vienna twice (Loved the museums, bike paths, general cleanliness, and abundance of transit). I also really enjoyed swimming in the local lake in my friend's village, so I wouldn't be mad at a clean nearby body of water I can jump in in the summer. I've heard from my friend, former tour guide, and current German teacher (who's Austrian) that Austria has fewer jobs, slightly lower salaries, and higher taxes, but that you get more for your tax money as far as public healthcare and on-time transit. They said Austrians also report being happier and Vienna being a top city for livability.

In Germany I am planning to check out Bremen, Leipzig, and maybe some Hamburg suburbs? I have a former teammate in Munich who I could ask for advice, and I could tap some fluent family members for translation help if I need it, but I haven't seen much of Germany - I went there as a kid a few times and spent 2 days in Munich on a tour. The impression I've gotten from Reddit subs is that Germany has more tech job prospects and higher salaries if I need to find a different job at some point, is a bit more accepting of Ausländer, and has lower taxes.

I have a relocation fund and will also have the proceeds from my apartment sale in Portugal when I decide where I want to go.  I have a tax professional and a lawyer already that can help with tax stuff.  My plan is to do some scouting trips, get a short term place while I look for a place to rent for a year or two, and then hopefully buy something small once I figure out exactly where I want to settle. 

I also plan to get involved with the local roller derby league (all of these cities have one from what I can see... ) and join other interest based activities so that I can meet people and have the maximum German language immersion. 

So my main questions for locals and/or people that have lived in both are: 

\-> Is one country better than the other based on what I'm looking for?

\-> Are there other cities I should check out?

\-> Would having citizenship in Germany be enough of a benefit to choose it over Austria?

\-> Am I forgetting any important factors?",5,1767729670.0,AskAGerman,8,1.0,False

​Subject and Style
​The Woman: She is young with a polished, scholarly appearance. She has a long, thick brown braid and wears round, wire-rimmed glasses. Her expression is focused and serious as she reads a newspaper.
​Attire: Her outfit is a mix of mid-century classic and ""dark academia"" styles:
​A tan wool beret.
​A crisp white button-down shirt with rolled-up sleeves.
​Brown suspenders over patterned trousers.
​Statement jewelry, including large gold hoop earrings and multiple stacked bracelets.
​Setting and Composition
​The Environment: She is seated outdoors at a rustic wooden table, likely at a European-style café. The background shows blurred brick buildings and greenery, suggesting an urban alleyway or a quiet street in a city like Paris or London.
​The Objects:
​Newspaper: She is holding a large, broadsheet-style newspaper, which obscures part of her face.
​Coffee: A white ceramic cup of cappuccino or latte sits on the table.
​The Gun: Most strikingly, a modern black semi-automatic handgun lies prominently on the table in the foreground, creating a sharp contrast with the otherwise peaceful, intellectual setting.
​Atmosphere and Lighting
​Mood: The image has a moody, ""spy-thriller"" vibe. The presence of the weapon suggests she is more than just a student or a casual reader; it implies she might be an assassin, a spy, or a character in a high-stakes narrative.

The first and most obvious one is the Boof of Mormon.

There's the doctrinal teachings in which they move away from mainstream Christianity:

2 maybe rejection of trinity, seeing Father and Jesus as distinct and separate? 

3 rejecting traditional view of heaven and hell, instead seeing hell as non-torture darkness for fallen angels and only a handful of people, and almost universal salvation of people into one of three heavens, 

4 rejection of creation of souls at pregnancy, we pre-exist, and 

5 rejection of creatio ex nihilo, we are created from eternal intelligences and eternal matter.

Ethically it seem to have moved away from mainstream Christianity in three points: 

1 communalism and sharing, trying fully communal property, and when that failed still havin a certain partial application of communal property, with tithing the church owning lots of stuff, 

2 clean living, no (strong) alcohol, tobbaco, coffee, tea, and to eat meat only sparsely, and

Even though I outgrew that job, I made some really close bonds there. One of them being in my department. She's also around my age (29) 

and we've had a really close bond beyond just work friends. Going over her house (as she never really allows anyone to her home like that) , talking and meeting   her mom, and her best friend. 

She's more introverted and avoidant, but over time, she has developed a comfort and safety with me. It's rare finding someone who you click with so well, and can be so in sync in perspective and humor. 

We have hung out many times sporadically throughout the years, more often initiated by me as we worked together, as she's expressed she can be passive and not much of a planner, and sporadic with texting. 

But I've tried to learn that's just how she operates. Taking it more personally in the past. She also struggles with depression and executive functioning, but I can tell she's tried in her own way for me, while me trying to honor her hermit periods. 

It was one of the things I expressed towards the end of me leaving, that I hope we can continue this connection, now that proximity isn't the glue. And of course she was sad that I won't be there anymore, but was super happy for my growth. And it did show after I left. 

She offered me a ride in our last shift together as we talked about my next chapter and when we'll hang out next. Well the following days before I started my new job, she reached out to me fo go thrifting with her, then texted me after our hang out to ask if I want to walk with her on the beach the following night. 

So we hung out back to back that week which was a lot coming from her to take that initiative , and she wished me good luck on my first day. 

She even texted me early that morning to have a great first day which was really sweet. From that week into the next, she became more responsive through text and reaching out more to tell me about her day at work, or sending me something funny. 

So I matched that energy and it made me happy she was putting the effort to stay in touch and be so supportive. Fast forward two weeks later, to The most recent time we hung out, was the early afternoon of NYE, 

because she texted me how the Christmas present she got me, finally arrived in the mail, so I suggested we finally do our gift exchange and catch up. I told her I had a hair appointment that day, so she offered to grab coffee with me and she'd give me a ride to my hair appointment, which was really sweet. 

Our hangout was really fun and wholesome, and we exchanged gifts in her car. She told me this day couldn't have been better, and that she wants to do coffee dates like this with me more often, and how she wants to plan activities with me in the beginning to January, She even texted immediately after to say ""I had so much  fun 💖 I'm obsessed with my gifts thank you so much 🫶🏼""

So I replied with ""Me too! I'm super happy and grateful we spent some time together on the last day of the year 🥰 thank you for my gifts as well. My heart is full. Means a lot""

So she was like ""same! Perfect way to end the year!""

Then I texted her New Year's Day the next day with ""Happy new year!  💝💝💝🥂I'm excited to share 2026 with you in this new chapter with more memories  :)) thank you for being  by my side, and May this year be the best one for you! We're limitless and we can achieve ANYTHING""

No reply that day or the day after, which I tried to not think too much of. As she usually comes around after a few days. Two days later I sent her a link to a new speakeasy bar that opened in our area that would be our vibe, no reply. Then the next day she sent me an Instagram reel, still not replying to my texts . The most recent text I sent her was yesterday morning, about something nice my manager did for us. But still crickets. 

She's been watching my stories, but quiet, now that it's almost a week now. Part of me that's logical knows she goes through quiet,  more introspective phases, but part of me hopes we can at least keep in contact 1-2 a week, and keep hanging every other week to keep our momentum. 

I don't want to pressure her or poke to ask what's going on or if she's okay. But part of me fears one week will turn into weeks, then a month, etc. right now it's been the longest of her without contacting me since I've left. I'm trying to give her space. I don't expect everyday contact or seeing each other all the time, but my brain does crave certainty or some consistency. Can anyone relate and offer some insight?

1q5t4hj,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1q5t4hj/can_anything_be_done_about_customers_that_just/,Can anything be done about customers that just speak very loudly?,"I'm not a barista anymore, so please call me out if I'm out of touch. 

I've been frequenting a coffee house for a few years now once a week to just get out of my in home office. This coffee house targets customers that need a third space to work in. They have their wifi plastered in big bold letters all over, with plenty of outlets and I think about two dozen tables that are easy to work at with laptops. Even on their Instagram they advertise their business as a place to study. There are also plenty of people that come to just hangout and socialize which is great! Just some context for what the general vibe is. 

Well lately there has been this customer that has been coming in OFTEN. I think she works with one of the baristas somewhere else because she is never on their socials and I never see her working there but I can hear her say ""I'll see you in my next shift!"" The only reason I know that is because she talks so loud that I can hear from across the entire establishment *with* headphones in, and I have inner ear noise canceling headphones. 

Her loud talking still wouldn't even be an issue for me, but girl talks to ANYONE who will listen to her about all of her traumas, it's like hearing a personal therapy session be broadcast over the intercom for an hour. It's incredibly distracting. And it's honestly making me not want to come here anymore but the baristas are so great, the space is great, and the coffee is SO great! 

There are other regulars I see often that are also chatty, and can definitely be loud sometimes. I say that because I don't really have a problem with noise, and they never ever bother me. This is just overboard.

Plus all of the other cafes in my area are not geared towards working individuals, some even discouraging it, so I don't want to impose on those spaces.  

Any advice? Should I say something the baristas? Should I myself say something to the customer? Should I just drop it? 

Also: yes I work in this space, but I make sure to purchase something every 1.5 hours that isn't just a black coffee so I'm not inhibiting up profits that a new customer would bring in. There are also so many tables, and very well spaced out. I don't think if come in with anything less than 4 tables still open.

I tried to use AI (Gemini) but unfortunately for reddit threads, the default link doesn't expand ALL comments so AI was only able to capture about 30 comments that was the default and so I did add in manually all the other ones. 

I excluded obvious joke/stupid answers (KC city manager, somali daycare owner, etc.) 

For hourly rates that people posted I converted them to an approximate yearly number. If there is a range posted, I tended to go for lower range. Also excluded non-base compensation (bonuses, equity options, etc.)

We both are givers and we are both coming out of marriages with partners that took advantage of that and didn't give back. 

During sexy time I prefer/ get really turned on someone being very primal/dominant.  When I tell him he can do anything he wants to me, he will respond with ""what would you like best"", we were dirty texting the other night and I suggested i would get on my knees for him and his response was concern for my knee I hurt a couple months back but is good now, I sent him a meme to tie me up and use my mouth and when he did tie me up he was 100% focused on just my pleasure. I've tried to tell him I genuinely enjoy pleasing him and that I like when he's decisive/ aggressive in bed but I think he has trouble tapping into that. 

I know this sounds like a ""my lobster is too juicy"" issue but does anyone have suggestions on how to help him understand/ switch it up or should I just embrace it as is?

I want to meet a girl to go to museums with, to have coffee and talk deep topics on the balcony at 10 pm with, to go on weekend trips to Italy and see Roman statues and have authentic pizza with, but most of all, someone who simply enjoys my company as much I enjoy theirs.

I’ve considered the basic starter grinders- Escore esp, fellow opus, and df54. I’ve decided against the opus due to retention issues.

Rating: 7.5/10
""Honestly a solid piece for winter. I dig the reversible feature—the fleece side looks cozy, but the nylon side in this pic looks a bit deflated and wrinkly. Might need a steam or some wear to puff it up properly. The Coyote/Brown colorway is versatile, but the zipper hardware looks a little flimsy in the photo. Good daily driver, but nothing mind-blowing.""

2. The North Face Nuptse (Black)
**Rating: 8/10**
""You can't really go wrong with a black Nuptse, it’s a staple for a reason. That said, it is the 'NPC uniform' of winter. The puffiness here looks decent, not too flat. My main gripe with these is usually the collar shape—sometimes it sits weirdly against the neck. If the down fill is good, it’s a keep, but don't expect to stand out in a crowd.""

3. Ami Paris Big Heart Sweater
**Rating: 6/10**
""Unpopular opinion maybe, but the massive Ami de Coeur logo is getting a bit played out. It screams 'I bought this for the logo.' The grey knit looks clean and the stitching on the 'A' seems tight, but I’m worried about the wool quality. These tend to pill super fast or feel itchy if the material blend is cheap. Clean look, just a bit basic.""

4. Purple Brand Denim Jacket
**Rating: 5.5/10**
""This is... a lot. The paint splatter and distress effect feels a bit forced and artificial in this lighting. It gives off strong 2016 hypebeast vibes. If you style it with plain black pants it might work, but it’s a loud piece. The fit on Purple Brand is usually tight/fitted, so if you prefer the boxy/baggy trend, you might hate how this sits.""

5. Gallery Dept. Long Sleeve Tee
Rating: 7/10**
""Clean graphic. The 'Bar Dé Music' print is one of their better, more low-key designs. The blank looks decent, maybe a bit thin? The cuffs look like they might lose elasticity quickly. It’s a cool layering piece, but for what it is (literally a cotton long sleeve), it’s nothing crazy. Good for a chill fit.""

6. Acne Studios 'Mud Wash' / Chain Print Jeans
Rating: 9/10**
""Best item in the haul, hands down. The wash and the trompe-l'œil (optical illusion) chain print are sick. It fits that grimey/grunge aesthetic perfectly. My only concern is styling—these are hard to pull off without looking like you literally rolled in dirt. If you have the right boots and cropped top/hoodie, these are fire. If not, they just look messy.""

7. Corteiz Velvet Track Jacket**
Rating: 7/10
""The velvet texture looks plush, definitely a comfy piece. Corteiz is huge right now, so the hype is there. However, black velvet is a lint magnet. You are going to be using a lint roller every time you leave the house. Also, the elastic banding at the hem looks a little loose/cheap. Good for a cozy UK drip vibe, but high maintenance.""

8. Off-White 'Out of Office' (OOO) Sneakers
Rating: 8.5/10**
""Super clean colorway. The white and grey is way more wearable than the loud colors Off-White usually does. The leather cuts look smooth and the shape is correct (chunky but not clown shoes). Just be warned, these are heavy on foot. If you plan on walking all day in these, your feet might get tired. Solid pickup.""

9. Birkenstock Boston Clogs (Taupe)
Rating: 9.5/10**
""Certified classic. You literally cannot hate on these. The suede looks buttery and the color is perfect for neutral tones. They go with sweatpants, jeans, shorts, whatever. The only downside is keeping that suede clean—one drop of coffee or rain and it's game over. Make sure you spray them with protector immediately.""

10. Purple Brand Distressed Jeans (Black)
Rating: 5/10
""Meh. Similar to the jacket, the distressing here looks kinda cheap, specifically the checkered patches peeking through. It feels very 'mall fashion.' The skinny/stacked fit is also kind of dying out in favor of baggy denim. If you're going for a rockstar look, they work, but otherwise, I’d pass on these for something with a better wash.""

11. Fear of God Essentials 1/2 Zip Pullover (Nylon)
Rating: 7/10
""This is way better than their standard cotton hoodies that everyone and their grandma wears. The nylon gives it a nice technical/sporty vibe while keeping that signature boxy FOG silhouette. My only issue with these is the material noise—you literally sound like a walking bag of chips when you move. Also, the elastic on the waist looks really aggressive; expect it to ride up constantly if you don't layer it right.""

12. 'Lucky Me I See Ghosts' Hoodie (Kids See Ghosts)**
Rating: 6.5/10
""Ah, the holy grail of 2018 hypebeasts. Honestly, this piece feels a bit dated now. The puff print on the text looks decent—it’s got that 3D texture you want—but be careful washing it because that puff *will* crack and peel eventually. The wash on the grey fabric looks okay, maybe a bit too dark compared to retail, but it's hard to tell without natural light. Cool for the nostalgia, but a bit loud for 2026.""

13. Ralph Lauren Pony Socks (3-Pack)
Rating: 8/10
""Not much to say here, they are socks. You're paying for the little horse embroidery, let's be real. They are definitely cleaner than standard Nike socks for wearing with loafers or low-top sneakers like the OOOs or Birkenstocks you posted earlier. They tend to pill after a few washes though, so enjoy the crisp white look while it lasts. Solid essential.""

14. Ralph Lauren Cable Knit Sweater (Cream)**
Rating: 8.5/10
""This is the 'Old Money' starter pack final boss. It’s a super safe, versatile piece that makes you look put-together instantly. The cable knitting gives it good texture so it doesn't look cheap. It pairs perfectly with the fatigue pants or denim from your previous haul. Just make sure it’s not too thin; some of the newer RL knits feel flimsy. If the weight is good, this is a wardrobe staple.""

1q5sqxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1q5sqxp/passive_anxious_and_emotionally_dysregulated/,"Passive, anxious, and emotionally dysregulated partner - should I stay or leave?","Hi Reddit,

I’m 37, my husband is 42, and I’ve been married for 4 years (together for 8). I’ve been inspired by a lot of relationship content lately, and I was wondering if I've been in the wrong relationship.

I’ve been putting this off because, deep down, I think I already know the answer - but it’s painful. I also feel vulnerable sharing this and worried about judgment for staying as long as I have.

The dynamic:  
He’s passive, anxious, conflict-avoidant, and approval-seeking. He grew up with a micromanaging, emotionally unavailable mom and was bullied. He’s generous and caring—pays all the bills, does chores without being asked, basically a “yes man.” He also steps up with family responsibilities, which I appreciate. He’s currently in therapy, but I feel resentful it took him so long to get there, and he didn’t want therapy until things got serious.

When he’s not stressed, he’s great: drives long hours for me, quit his job to move with me, does chores, pays bills. These moments make it very hard to leave.

But when he’s anxious, confronted, or under stress, everything falls apart. He gets defensive, dysregulated, and sometimes disrespectful. That’s when I feel alone and doubt the relationship.

Some personal context:  
I’ve done schema therapy. My core wounds: emotional deprivation, defectiveness, mistrust/abuse, childhood parentification. I’m highly sensitive (HSP) and tend to amplify negatives. People’s facial expressions affect me deeply, and rudeness can ruin my day.

His passivity triggers my “I’m alone and must handle everything” wound. My control and criticism trigger his “I’m not good enough” wound.

I make most decisions, earn much more than him, and feel like the leader in everything-life goals, travel, logistics, responsibility. I’m naturally more driven than him, which frustrates me. It mirrors my childhood and family dynamics, and I also feel pressure from the fear of running out of time to find the right man.

Serious issues:

* Gaslighting & finances (3 years ago): He bought a second-hand car without consulting me (we have separate finances) and gaslighted me for three days. I sometimes critique his financial choices, but his response seemed like a way to regain control—it hurt deeply.

Conflict & emotional dysregulation (3 incidents):

1. Wednesday / Period: I was on my period and upset about the bathroom. During an argument, I said my stomach hurt, and he said “Goddamit” while still trying to care for me. I felt overwhelmed and ran to a hotel. At the time, I was working two jobs, not because I had to, but because I wanted to, so I was exhausted.
2. McDonald’s / Interview: While traveling and I know he's tired, I asked the same question 3 times, and he rolled his eyes. Other times, he seemed burdened by simple tasks, like driving me to an interview or commenting on traffic lights while sighing. I confronted him once and saw him banging the steering wheel, which upset me deeply.
3. Pre-planned trip / hike: I wanted him to take initiative. In the morning, he sometimes gathered items, packed bags, made food - sometimes inconsistently.

* We went to the wrong parking lot, adding extra walking, and I felt frustrated.
* Conflict escalated: he tried to apologize twice, I yelled, he kicked sand, I threw coffee milk, he retrieved it and said “It’s my favorite milk,” which showed some emotional regulation.
* After the trip, I became very anxious and noticed him looking at other women multiple times, unusual behavior for him. I immediately booked a trip home, which made him upset.
* During a hike, I misread his actions (opening a door), screamed, cried on the way down, and then shockingly, he tried to record me to gain control. He  deleted it and apologize at night. I was shocked of his capability of treating me that harsh during conflict.

Incompatibility patterns:

* Decision-making: I need initiative; he’s passive and often needs reminders. I wonder if I’m pushing him to be someone he’s not.
* Conflict style: I need calm, validation, and problem-solving. He escalates quickly and focuses on his feelings, which triggers my abandonment fears.
* Honesty: I need honesty and clarity; he sometimes deflects, minimizes, or avoids issues.

I’m financially independent and could leave safely. The hardest part is losing him as my best friend - the version who shows up, tries, and doesn’t leave.

We currently live separately due to escalations (my lease is up in April), see each other a few times a week, and he helps with chores.

Questions I’m struggling with:

* Should I stay or leave?
* If I leave, how do I make sure I won’t regret it? I’ve regretted leaving a past relationship where the man seemed compatible in leadership, empathy, and initiative, but our life goals differed. That regret has stayed with me for a very long time, even now.
* Am I asking too much? Given my age, financial independence, and the qualities I want (initiative, leadership, emotional intelligence, honesty, loyalty, care for family, generosity, drive), maybe someone like this is rare. How do I make peace with being alone at 60?
* Should I focus on not triggering him, enjoy his positive traits, and put my energy into personal projects (content creation) until I feel fully ready to leave?

What struck me from relationship:

* Even though he has changed, I’m still resentful. Therapy has helped, but it makes me ask - why did it take so long?
* I wonder if I’ve been disrespecting myself by staying so long.

I've tried different settings, but as soon as I try to grind finer, it just doesn't want to work. For example, at setting 6 internally and 5 on the coffee machine, it won’t grind at all. I even tried setting 4 internally and 10 on the coffee machine with the same issue.

At first I felt like the drug changed my personality in some ways. It made me more quiet and what I describe as “zoned” I’ve had insomnia my entire life but it got worse when I started the medication. Recently I picked up a gnarly habit Nicotine. I was bored of being depressed and working all the time so I decided to go buy a pack of cigs. I instantly hated smoking but felt sorta familiar with it because growing up with my dad I’ve never seen him without a Marlboro Red 100 in his hand. I quit smoking for a bit, but I had this silent itch in my sub conscious to get back into it. That’s when I bought a vape, I also hated it but still did it. I got so much anxiety using nicotine initially, it made my head spin I felt sick, and just over all a bad experience. 

Now ever… I’m smoking almost a pack a day and hitting my vape while at school and work. What was once a gross habit that I didn’t understand how people could enjoy I started noticing the positive side of the effects and how they interacted with my ADHD brain. I feel very dialed in on nicotine, I get this rush but I love that rush, it’s not an anxious rush anymore… I feel lighter in my body and I’m able to pay deeper attention to whatever is in front of me. At work I’m more talkative and sociable, often just doing work without complaining or really thinking that I’m at work. 

The downside however is I almost never sleep now… 2-4 hours max a day, and I often have to jumpstart my brain with Vyvanse coffee and a couple cigarettes. 

I know this is bad for me but I feel a greater sense of confidence in myself like never before because I’m actually a functional human being for once. I’ve never been so productive in my life, and unfortunately at this point I don’t care about the health affects. I’ve been more involved in my friendships, more sociable with girls and less scared of convos. I’ve just felt a sense of my higher self coming out day by day. ",2,1767728533.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

This thing is constantly making a splashing mess throughout the day whether it's in use or not. The puck holder holds like 4 pucks before it starts telling you to empty. The water thing needs to be refilled daily regardless of how many drinks you make because it's constantly flushing water, and the base needs to be dumped daily because it's constantly flushing water. I have a $300 breville baristina that's significantly less work and upkeep to use and also significantly quicker. I mean this terra caffe is not quick at all to make an espresso.

1q5snyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/recoverywithoutAA/comments/1q5snyx/relapse_natural_substances_cannabis_psilocybin/,"Relapse & natural substances (cannabis, psilocybin, iboga)","We need to stop letting people use the word ""relapse"" as a weapon of shame. Biologically, a relapse isn't just using a substance. A relapse is a return to a specific, destructive cycle where a drug hijacks the brain's reward system. When we reject addictive narcotics like alcohol, opiates, or amphetamines, we're rejecting molecules that work against our biology. That doesn't mean we have to reject the natural and therapeutic tools like antidepressants, cannabis, psilocybin, LSD, iboga, and bufo that work with our chemistry to help us heal.

The difference comes down to the hijack. When we use addictive narcotics, they hijack our reward system. These substances force our brains to dump massive, unnatural amounts of dopamine into the nucleus accumbens, which is our survival center. This spike is so extreme that the brain shuts down its own receptors to protect itself. This is called downregulation. It's the reason addiction feels like a life-or-death need; the brain physically rewired itself to value the substance over food, sleep, or connection. That's what a relapse looks like. It's a return to that state of being hijacked and losing all control.



Substances like antidepressants, cannabis, psilocybin, LSD, iboga, and bufo don't work this way. They don't work against our biology to shut us down; they work with it to enhance and heal it. Our brains have built-in receptors designed specifically for these molecules, like the 5-HT2A receptor for psilocybin and antidepressants or the endocannabinoid system for cannabis. These aren't invaders; they're keys that fit locks already present in our DNA. Instead of killing brain cells, tools like psilocybin and LSD trigger synaptogenesis, which is the growth of new physical connections. This allows us to literally rewire the patterns that kept us stuck. Even ibogaine works to fix the damage by repairing the very dopamine neurons that narcotics destroyed.



We also have to fact-check the very foundation of the purity model. The ""spiritual awakening"" that AA is built on wasn't a divine event. It was Bill Wilson tripping balls on belladonna and henbane in a hospital bed. He was experiencing a medically induced hallucination, but the program rebranded a drug trip as a spiritual miracle. Later, fourteen years into his sobriety, Wilson used LSD under medical treatment to heal the chronic depression that the 12 steps couldn't touch. He even wrote to Carl Jung about how these substances provided the psychological shift that the program failed to provide. AA suppressed this history to protect their brand, not the truth.

The total abstinence model is hypocritical because it ignores science. People in meetings will call your cannabis or antidepressant use a relapse while they chain-smoke nicotine and drink pots of coffee. Nicotine is a stimulant that hits the same reward centers as narcotics, yet it's socially accepted because of dogma, not biology. We need to define recovery by the results in our lives. If we've stopped the destructive behavior that was killing us, and we're using tools that work with our chemistry to stay balanced and connected, we're in recovery. We aren't starting over because we used a tool that worked. We're moving forward and using the pharmacy that nature and science provided to keep us free from the substances that actually hijacked our lives.

Our 3rd and recent coffee date on NYE went really well as we talked for a few hours (longer than planned,) felt we aligned on taking things slow, boundaries, and she said she was still interested but going through a stressful period and wants to take it slow.

Over New Year’s, I sent a friendly group “Happy New Year” video (something I’d mentioned doing beforehand) and later, after giving space, sent a low-pressure check-in like “Hope you’ve been able to take it easy! Let me know how your New Year’s was when you have the chance.”

It’s now been past a few days since that check in with no response. I haven’t sent anything else, but I’m struggling with whether this is just her being overwhelmed / avoidant as she brought up she struggles with or if the silence is effectively a quiet no.

I don’t want to pressure her, but I also don’t want to overanalyze or hang on indefinitely.
At this point, is it better to:
	1.	send one final calm check-in for clarity, or
	2.	accept the silence as the answer and stop initiating?

Recently I have gotten over the relationship and ready to step out in the scene to talk to new people. I was 16 when the relationship started and 20 now and haven’t had much experience flirting and what not. As I’ve started to become way more of an extrovert and talk to girls I notice myself getting in my head. This is happening right now. I am home from college for the winter and a girl comes up we didn’t really talk but my boss was telling me how she was checking me out. This peaked my interest she comes up the next day and we talk so briefly. After so little talk, my mind is looking to speak to her again and I’ve been thinking about it a lot. Even though I feel there’s not much a basis there. I think it’s maybe the part of my brain that knows I have a chance and I just become locked in on it. But I recognize that me constantly thinking about such a small thing is unhealthy and I shouldn’t do it yet I still catch myself wondering if she’ll show up again to my department next weekend and so on. I don’t know if this is something that’ll go away and it’s something I have to practice in my mind. I do plan on striking up a more meaningful conversation and if she seems interested I’ll offer my number and to go out for coffee sometime. But i just can’t shake it out of mind for what feels like something so little to base it on.

Not for prediction, but to frame my mindset for the day.  
  
for example, when I was obsessing over whether my partner and I were on the same page, I kept pulling the Two of Cups. It didn't tell me 'yes' or 'no' about the future, but it kept reminding me to focus on the connection we \*were\* building in the present, not just my anxiety about where it was going. It became less about fortune-telling and more about... emotional triage, I guess?  
  
i think a lot of beginners get this wrong - they expect the cards to make the decision for them. for me, it's about quieting the noise so I can hear what I already know. Anyone else use a super simple daily pull like this? do you find it creates more clarity or more confusion when you're in that uncertain space?

1q5s8mf,https://www.reddit.com/r/KundaliniAwakening/comments/1q5s8mf/kundalini_and_awakening_can_completely_overwhelm/,"Kundalini and awakening can completely overwhelm you, and even break you mentally – really, Jesus Christ. Wasn’t this energy already finding you broken?","Kundalini –

is the energy of life. Yes, it can be intense, it can feel a bit overwhelming, but it is certainly not painful – at least in my experience. Kundalini is an energy that, when awakened, wants to lift you to the heights and clears the obstacles in its way. For me, it feels like an orgasm, only in different parts of the body.

And yes, sometimes I feel like everything inside me is about to explode. And then I ask myself: what am I still not seeing, what am I still hiding from myself?

The further I go, the more I understand that awakening is not about being “more enlightened.”

It’s about being in your body, about being yourself in every moment, in every emotion, in every breath.

Soul, body, and mind – are one.

After every intense spiritual experience, I return to myself in this way:

I go for a run, releasing everything – tension, energy, the cry of my soul,

I stand barefoot under a tree in the garden, feeling the earth, feeling life, sometimes affirming, sometimes crying,

I thank the experience and return to everyday life.

And then… I feel lighter. Not perfectly, but at least a little – and that is already a huge relief.

**Pain** –which has been a faithful companion on this path and is now emerging, has been accumulating for years,so it’s no wonder it hurts. There was a moment when I was so tired of all of this that I shouted my truth aloud –

that I did not ask for this awakening,

that sometimes I would rather live in illusion and know nothing. Want to Go back to the moment before, because then it felt okay, or at least it seemed so.

I prayed to God to take me from here for over a year, until an almost fatal car accident happened on the highway. A truck started to enter my lane. There was nowhere to escape because of the barriers. I saw that I would end up under its wheels, and at that moment I thought: “He doesn’t see me, he’s about to hit me, my children… I have to go back to my children.” I pressed the gas (knowing I chose life) and almost managed to escape. The truck’s cabin hit my door, my car spun and got stuck between the barriers and the truck. The truck pushed me for several hundred meters more, and I felt calm and knew that I was safe and not going anywhere yet.

So please… sit with yourself in silence and be honest with yourself:

what else is blocked within you? What are you still hiding from yourself? What is there that I don’t won’t to accept??

Is it the grief of abandonment,

the desire to be seen,

or to be loved?

Bring those shadows to the surface, into the light.

That is exactly what energy does – when it hits a blockage, it lets you know that there is something to heal. It shows you what still needs healing.

And for heaven’s sake –

the energy rises because you allowed it.

Because you began the inner work.

Because you released blockages – layer by layer – and the energy simply started to flow.

**And believe me, the energy itself is not the threat.**

**The threat is the mind that creates narratives, that writes stories.**

If you feel the energy is too strong, you have the right to step back.

Turn on the TV, watch a silly movie, play games – return to a simple life.

I don’t believe that the energy itself can hurt anyone.

Harm occurs when we try to force it, control it, or speed it up.

Sometimes it’s best to let it come naturally, in its own time.

**Trust yourself and the process.**

Am I afraid?

Of course I am – most of all, of losing my children.

But I know it’s part of my humanity. 

I allow myself to feel that fear,

Simply because it is part of my experience.

But it also shows that I am whole –

a soul that has a body and a mind.

For some time now, I have been practicing lucid dreaming.

I chose it to be able to communicate with my higher self,

and recently I tried to enter a lucid dream using the WILD method.

I was lying in bed early in the morning and felt energy flowing over me,

as if it wanted to scare me,

pulling the blanket off me and putting it back on –

over and over again.

It was so real that it was almost unbelievable, but…

I decided: “I am not afraid,” and I will not wake up to escape.

I jumped into it, grabbed it,

and held my fear, my “shadow,” in my arms,

shouting: “I love you, I love you.”

The energy subsided until it finally changed.

I held my son in my arms,

and all I felt was love.

I was fully aware of what was happening,

but I did not add a narrative,

I did not run, I did not defend myself.

You could say I integrated my fear

and transformed it into love.

Some might call this paranoia – maybe.

I call it shadow integration,

and lucid dreaming is the tool here.

I have also been in a place where I thought

nothing could move me anymore, nothing could surprise me,

that nothing could stop me.

But I knew one thing – I would not give up.

I wake up before sunrise,

I feel the scent of morning air,

I watch as the world awakens.

I run and feel the ground beneath my feet,

the wind on my cheeks.

Isn’t it worth being here and now?

Please, pay attention to the small things: a flower, a book, the smell of coffee.

Be here, be present.

I don’t believe there’s nothing that can fill you with wonder.

Acceptance of life. Loving it as it is.

We did not come here to be above life.

We came here to feel, to experience, to live –

every emotion, every pain, every joy.

And even though it’s sometimes hard…

I still believe that life is a gift

and it’s worth celebrating in every breath,

in every smile,

and in every ray of sunshine.

And the energy – chi, Shakti, Kundalini – however you call it – very subtly points the way. The way back home. And you know what? You are damn lucky that you can experience this in your lifetime.

I send lots of love and strength to everyone who needs it the most.

1q5s7kl,/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1q5ofdk/was_the_behavior_of_this_colleague_and_her/,Was the behavior of this colleague and her husband normal?,"
I am a 46-year-old man. For two years, I worked with a female colleague who was 50, four years older than me. We are both married and have two children of the same age. We got along very well. We would chat and go to lunch together, sometimes with other colleagues. She would also bring me homemade dishes because she knew I enjoyed good food. Sometimes she would give me cakes and snacks; I felt she was almost like a big sister. Occasionally, she acted childishly around me—for instance, one day she ran toward me to talk to me like a child, and she would tease me during our discussions. Every time a workplace meal was organized for a celebration, she insisted I participate, even though I don’t typically enjoy work social events. Afterward, she would become colder and more distant. Sometimes she would ask me to go out at lunchtime with her to run some errands. She often suggested outings with the children, but I systematically refused because I had no desire to see a colleague outside of work.

Then I had problems with management—a kind of harassment that was very difficult for me. For several months, I didn’t speak to anyone at work, focusing only on my tasks and trying to get through that tough period. This colleague tried to find out why I was isolating myself, and I simply replied, ""I have a lot of work,"" without further explanation. One day, I ran into her by chance on the metro, and she came over to me, suggesting we travel together. She behaved in a way I would describe as flirting (she got very close to me, pressed her chest against my arm, and leaned in very close to speak to me). One day, she even came into my office to look at something on my screen and stood very close against me. I didn't know how to react because she is older, and I was quite surprised.

I eventually found another job in a different office, and my departure was announced. This colleague then came to see me, congratulated me, asked when my last day was, and said she was inviting me to lunch that day. On the day, she took me out and asked if she had done something wrong and why I wasn't speaking to her anymore. I explained that I had been suffering from harassment and had been looking for another job, which I had found.

She was relieved that my distant attitude wasn't because of her. She then continued to make flirting gestures, such as touching my hand. I then told her that since I was leaving for another office, we could stay in touch and see each other for family outings with the children and spouses (this might have been a mistake on my part!). Delighted, she organized several outings during the summer, and we saw each other regularly—always with our respective spouses at my request, as I didn't want us to meet without her husband and my wife. I thought our relationship was great. Except that sometimes, when I went out with my children and didn't tell her, she would point it out: ""You didn't call me, that's not nice."" Yet, it was her choice, and frankly, I didn't care. She also started criticizing her husband, saying he doesn't invest himself, that he just sits at home drinking coffee, and that he is old. When I asked her how they met, she told me he was the one who hit on her and that she wasn't interested at first because he was unemployed at the time. In short, it wasn't love at first sight. She also asked me to download series for her and put them on a USB stick—something her husband could have done.

She had promised to show me a cooking recipe. I suggested she come to the house with her family, that we all cook together, and then eat the meal as a group. But one day, after an outing with her son and mine (exceptionally without the spouses), she said, ""Let's meet at your place for the recipe."" Okay, so once we arrived at my house, I thought we would chat over coffee or tea, but she refused. She started cooking all by herself and did the dishes without saying a word. It was very bizarre. Then she said, ""The meal is ready, I have to go now."" She left the premises without even having a conversation. In my opinion, it was a truly strange scene.

She had planned to go on a trip to Spain with her family; I told her I knew that country well and preferred Portugal. She then decided to go to Portugal with her family instead. I found that weird.

She began organizing outings with both families herself—booking hotels, suggesting hikes, barbecues, and meals at home, or outings with the children to the pool, etc. She even wanted our two families to go abroad together or to a mountain chalet. She also suggested organizing a ""girls' trip"" for her and my mother to a spa. Then, after about ten intense outings and several dinner invitations at each other's homes, she suddenly stopped giving any news. Just like that. She used to call to suggest outings on the spot... One day, her husband was supposed to help me assemble furniture—a plan made weeks in advance—and on the day of, he bailed on me. She intervened to force him to keep his promise, and when I went to pick him up by car, he said to me in the auto during the trip: ""If she wants us to separate, no problem."" I didn't understand that comment.

Then, no more news at all... I wrote to her several times to see if everything was okay, and she replied briefly. I then sent New Year's greetings to her husband, but got no response. She had promised to give me contacts for renovation companies, which she never did.

I finally confronted her via SMS several months later, after hearing nothing... I asked her why they had disappeared and why she hadn't given me the promised renovation information. She wrote back saying she was on vacation. I wrote to her: ""The two of you disappeared without giving us the promised contacts; you are users (profiteurs)."" She then called twice, but I didn't answer. She then replied with something like: ""A true friend would have tried to find out why someone is distancing themselves,"" and concluded: ""This is where our relationship ends.""

1q5s41r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1q5s41r/new_girlfriend_i_met_off_bumble_seems_crazy/,"New girlfriend I met off Bumble seems crazy, seeking advice","Hi all,

I met my girlfriend off Bumble around May of 2025, and we dated and became official since August of 2025, im a male 27, shes a female 27. From the start shes a nurse, makes a good salary for herself. Shes mentioned her past 3 relationships shes been cheated on, as she “claims” which im dubious. Her last ex was abusive and was arrested after he shot himself and lied. However, everytime we hangout she mentions how much she hates her ex and scathes about him 24/7. I noticed when we hangout she constantly needs to do something physical, she speaks really fast like her mind is all over the place, almost stressful to watch her be like this. 

On our second date, I thought something odd happened. We were at a wine bar drinking when she looked over and her sister and her boyfriend were sitting next to us, my gf acted surprised and was like what are you doing here? Literally right next to us. 
We went to a bar together but I thought it was odd but moved on. A week later she asked to get pizza after work, so I said i’ll meet you there as its in her town. I got there and she had a meltdown saying shes really mad I didn’t pick her up and that should “be expected.” I would of picked her up no problem and drove 45 minutes away from work, she didn’t ask. The next day I was hanging out with friends and she wanted to hangout which I told her no, especially being rude yesterday. After she kept pressing me, she called me after getting angry and said shes mad. I told her too bad and went to bed and mentioned my time with my friends is something I value greatly and should be respected just as I do the same. 

The next day we met in person, she called me a child saying I didn’t answer her call and waste her time not hanging out. She said I don’t hangout or make time to see her, although I work 65 hours a week. She randomly claimed I just want to be with her because she makes six figures and that Im desperate to be with a girl before I turned 30, then mentions I treat her like a friend. I shrugged it off and said that she should communicate and respect I have a life outside of her. I mentioned if this continues, that this will not be tolerated and I will walk away, and she got quiet saying the last thing she wants is a breakup. 

A week later, we were hanging out and kept saying I don’t love her because I didn’t want to have sex ( I was exhausted and had no sleep). Repeatedly said that throughout the week, then mentioned she wants to get coffee when I was at work, because she didn’t believe what I did for work. Kept insisting we meet for coffee closeby, to justify this she mentioned her ex lied about his jobs. I told her too bad, and declined. I asked to hangout with her and mentioned the comments and comparisons with her ex have to stop, because I am getting annoyed by all the neurotic behavior, and she has to move on her from her ex. She mentions she will stop, later that night she opens instagram and mentions she was looking at her ex’s instagram because he was supposed to go to jail tomorrow, because her search history was viewable from where I was sitting. 

I went home immediately and was beyond annoyed and upset. She kept asking whats wrong and if im okay? I mentioned to her we can talk tomorrow in person. Am I completely justified this ending relationship? She texted me saying everything about her ex is her feeling comfortable discussing this with me and she thought it was okay to do this?

Rating: 7.5/10
""Honestly a solid piece for winter. I dig the reversible feature—the fleece side looks cozy, but the nylon side in this pic looks a bit deflated and wrinkly. Might need a steam or some wear to puff it up properly. The Coyote/Brown colorway is versatile, but the zipper hardware looks a little flimsy in the photo. Good daily driver, but nothing mind-blowing.""

2. The North Face Nuptse (Black)
**Rating: 8/10**
""You can't really go wrong with a black Nuptse, it’s a staple for a reason. That said, it is the 'NPC uniform' of winter. The puffiness here looks decent, not too flat. My main gripe with these is usually the collar shape—sometimes it sits weirdly against the neck. If the down fill is good, it’s a keep, but don't expect to stand out in a crowd.""

3. Ami Paris Big Heart Sweater
**Rating: 6/10**
""Unpopular opinion maybe, but the massive Ami de Coeur logo is getting a bit played out. It screams 'I bought this for the logo.' The grey knit looks clean and the stitching on the 'A' seems tight, but I’m worried about the wool quality. These tend to pill super fast or feel itchy if the material blend is cheap. Clean look, just a bit basic.""

4. Purple Brand Denim Jacket
**Rating: 5.5/10**
""This is... a lot. The paint splatter and distress effect feels a bit forced and artificial in this lighting. It gives off strong 2016 hypebeast vibes. If you style it with plain black pants it might work, but it’s a loud piece. The fit on Purple Brand is usually tight/fitted, so if you prefer the boxy/baggy trend, you might hate how this sits.""

5. Gallery Dept. Long Sleeve Tee
Rating: 7/10**
""Clean graphic. The 'Bar Dé Music' print is one of their better, more low-key designs. The blank looks decent, maybe a bit thin? The cuffs look like they might lose elasticity quickly. It’s a cool layering piece, but for what it is (literally a cotton long sleeve), it’s nothing crazy. Good for a chill fit.""

6. Acne Studios 'Mud Wash' / Chain Print Jeans
Rating: 9/10**
""Best item in the haul, hands down. The wash and the trompe-l'œil (optical illusion) chain print are sick. It fits that grimey/grunge aesthetic perfectly. My only concern is styling—these are hard to pull off without looking like you literally rolled in dirt. If you have the right boots and cropped top/hoodie, these are fire. If not, they just look messy.""

7. Corteiz Velvet Track Jacket**
Rating: 7/10
""The velvet texture looks plush, definitely a comfy piece. Corteiz is huge right now, so the hype is there. However, black velvet is a lint magnet. You are going to be using a lint roller every time you leave the house. Also, the elastic banding at the hem looks a little loose/cheap. Good for a cozy UK drip vibe, but high maintenance.""

8. Off-White 'Out of Office' (OOO) Sneakers
Rating: 8.5/10**
""Super clean colorway. The white and grey is way more wearable than the loud colors Off-White usually does. The leather cuts look smooth and the shape is correct (chunky but not clown shoes). Just be warned, these are heavy on foot. If you plan on walking all day in these, your feet might get tired. Solid pickup.""

9. Birkenstock Boston Clogs (Taupe)
Rating: 9.5/10**
""Certified classic. You literally cannot hate on these. The suede looks buttery and the color is perfect for neutral tones. They go with sweatpants, jeans, shorts, whatever. The only downside is keeping that suede clean—one drop of coffee or rain and it's game over. Make sure you spray them with protector immediately.""

10. Purple Brand Distressed Jeans (Black)
Rating: 5/10
""Meh. Similar to the jacket, the distressing here looks kinda cheap, specifically the checkered patches peeking through. It feels very 'mall fashion.' The skinny/stacked fit is also kind of dying out in favor of baggy denim. If you're going for a rockstar look, they work, but otherwise, I’d pass on these for something with a better wash.""

11. Fear of God Essentials 1/2 Zip Pullover (Nylon)
Rating: 7/10
""This is way better than their standard cotton hoodies that everyone and their grandma wears. The nylon gives it a nice technical/sporty vibe while keeping that signature boxy FOG silhouette. My only issue with these is the material noise—you literally sound like a walking bag of chips when you move. Also, the elastic on the waist looks really aggressive; expect it to ride up constantly if you don't layer it right.""

12. 'Lucky Me I See Ghosts' Hoodie (Kids See Ghosts)**
Rating: 6.5/10
""Ah, the holy grail of 2018 hypebeasts. Honestly, this piece feels a bit dated now. The puff print on the text looks decent—it’s got that 3D texture you want—but be careful washing it because that puff *will* crack and peel eventually. The wash on the grey fabric looks okay, maybe a bit too dark compared to retail, but it's hard to tell without natural light. Cool for the nostalgia, but a bit loud for 2026.""

13. Ralph Lauren Pony Socks (3-Pack)
Rating: 8/10
""Not much to say here, they are socks. You're paying for the little horse embroidery, let's be real. They are definitely cleaner than standard Nike socks for wearing with loafers or low-top sneakers like the OOOs or Birkenstocks you posted earlier. They tend to pill after a few washes though, so enjoy the crisp white look while it lasts. Solid essential.""

14. Ralph Lauren Cable Knit Sweater (Cream)**
Rating: 8.5/10
""This is the 'Old Money' starter pack final boss. It’s a super safe, versatile piece that makes you look put-together instantly. The cable knitting gives it good texture so it doesn't look cheap. It pairs perfectly with the fatigue pants or denim from your previous haul. Just make sure it’s not too thin; some of the newer RL knits feel flimsy. If the weight is good, this is a wardrobe staple.""

We’re visiting New Zealand for the first time, arriving from London into Auckland on 10 February. After a short time there, we’ll be flying to Queenstown and hiring a car/van and travelling through the South Island until 28 February. We already have Airbnbs booked and are now planning activities at each stop and along the drive.

South Island route:

Queenstown → Kaikōura → Matiri / Nelson area → Hokitika → Franz Josef → Wanaka → Te Anau → Queenstown → Lake Tekapo → Christchurch

We’re a group of 4 adults travelling on a mainly low–mid budget, so we’re especially looking for:

	•	Low-cost or free activities

	•	Affordable local food spots (bakeries, takeaways, pubs, food trucks)

	•	Good value cafés & coffee roasters

	•	Walks, viewpoints & nature spots that don’t require expensive tours

Things we’re interested in:

	•	Great walks (short–medium, scenic, quieter if possible)

	•	Photography spots (sunrise/sunset, lakes, mountains, coast)

	•	Good coffee — local favourites rather than tourist cafés

	•	Nature spots locals actually go to

	•	Sports — football (soccer) and especially local NZ sports or community matches/events between 10–28 Feb

	•	Worthwhile stop-offs between towns for views, swims, short walks or cheap eats

We’re trying to avoid big-ticket tourist experiences and would love recommendations that locals rate and that offer good value.

Thanks — really appreciate any local insight 🙏",1,1767727214.0,travel,1,1.0,False

i used to be one of those people with color coded calendars and 47 productivity apps (rip to the $200+ i spent on subscriptions last year lmao). tiredness and brain fog hit me hard in november and i just stopped caring for a bit. one weekend i woke up and was like screw it, today im just gonna do whatever feels right in the moment. walked to a random coffee shop i never been to, read for like 3 hours, fixed my bike that was sitting broken for months, called an old friend.

the weird part is that monday i felt SO ready to work. like my brain was actually excited to tackle my project list. i thought it was a fluke but its been consistent for 4 weeks now. my theory is that my brain needed one day where it wasnt being managed and optimized, you know? like it got tired of being a productivity robot 24/7.

now i actively protect my saturdays as my chaos day. no calendars, no optimization, no guilt. and somehow my sunday planning sessions are better, im actually finishing my weekly goals, and weirdly ive even got some money saved up now which never happened before. feels like im breaking some productivity law but it works",42,1767727203.0,productivity,4,0.99,False

Transportation includes public transit (train/bus) and walking – scenarios like meeting a friend for coffee at a cafe or doing some light shopping.

I see two approaches. One is a stroller. That seems simple. The baby can chill in the stroller while you're having coffee with a friend.

The other approach is baby wearing, which is great because it's more mobile and takes up less space on transit. But once you're at your destination, what do you do with the kid? Leave it strapped to you? I'd prefer to have a place to set the baby while I'm enjoying my coffee.

What are others doing? Is there any like foldable bassinet solution? Or is stroller, the obvious answer, the right one here? Any other tips, gear or otherwise, for parenting infants in a walkable city? Thanks!",1,1767727178.0,NewParents,3,1.0,False
1q5s1s0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1q5s1s0/moving_forward_after_possible_ea/,Moving forward after possible EA?,"My husband 33M and I 29F have been together for 9 years and married for 3. We have a 5 month old baby and have been in couples counseling for a year because he’s been unemployed for 4 years and navigating separation from his toxic family system.



My extended family is wealthy and I am only child so finances in the future aren’t a concern. It’s always been more important to me that my husband pursues what he’s interested in and what will help him grow as a person rather than maximizing income. 



For years earlier in our relationship, he had a stable job and I was bouncing around from gig to gig while I was going to weekly individual therapy to work through my own issues with my family. He was extremely supportive and when his company got acquired (and he got paid out a decent amount, roughly 3 years salary), I wanted to do the same and allow him grace as he navigated his next steps.



Three years later, I had had enough and we started couples counseling because I needed support with bills and I was frustrated. We were making progress and we both always wanted kids so we decided to try and got pregnant immediately.



His family is not supportive of him or his goals and he has a history of hiding relationships and things that are important to him to protect them/himself. Through individual and couples counseling, he decided to start new hobbies and make new friends and I saw a very obvious positive change in him. 



He befriended a girl 25F at one of these hobbies and I was extremely supportive of the friendship. Over the course of half a dozen negative interactions for me, I didn’t tell him he couldn’t see her but after each interaction, I was clear about what boundary was crossed for me and why it made me uncomfortable. The friendship is purely platonic but he would do small things that chose her over me like for example, he would tell me their plans to get coffee and go for a walk which to me is like a 2-3 hour thing max but it would be for five hours and he wouldn’t communicate why it was going longer. At the very beginning, he took her to a nice dinner and paid which we both agreed was extremely inappropriate. I found out months later that he had been lying to me about innocuous things like the circumstances around them getting coffee or lunch and basically had a breakdown because I didn’t understand why he couldn’t prioritize honesty in our relationship when I’ve been so supportive. They would only see each other once every few weeks but I was extremely pregnant and vulnerable and I didn’t like arguing about him not being reasonable when I felt like I was being supportive. After we had the baby, this came to a head when we had gotten a babysitter and decided to go out. We had a drink together and then I met up with some friends and he did too. After my friends and I were done, I went to go find him again and couldn't. We share our locations and his was down. Our babysitter was available until 10pm so I went home and he didn't show up until 11:20pm. He said he was out for a walk and I didn't believe him. I went through his phone (not proud) and saw that he had gotten drinks with this girl. I was livid and told him we were done. 



Our counselor identified that because my husband can’t trust his mother, he didn’t believe my support and felt like he had to hide his friendship. Also because he had separated from his family and the pressure of becoming a father, he was seeking out connection anywhere and trying to expedite closeness. After we unearthed all of this, he went no contact with her for 1.5 months but he also has a history of cutting off friendships so both our therapist and me encouraged him to get a coffee with this girl to apologize for being hot and cold. I felt anxious about it but it was communicated in advance and was only for one hour and he came home right afterwards and told me how it went.



We decided to host a NYE party and waffled a lot on whether to invite her or not. I ultimately decided that it would be healing to have her there and have my husband prioritize me in real time and we talked at length about boundaries: no talking to her 1-1 for more than 5 minutes, prioritizing meaningful connection between the two of us, having my husband check in on me at least 2-3 times during the party to ensure I am comfortable. Her and her brother showed up around 10pm and within 20 minutes, he had been talking to her for longer than 10 minutes. I pulled him aside and he looked so dejected and annoyed with me. 



He proceeded to get drunk and avoid her but I could still see him looking in her direction and we didn’t have any meaningful points of connection at the party nor did he check in with me. He passed out around 1am and I cried myself to sleep. We discussed it at nauseam the next day and he apologized profusely, said he felt like he wanted all his new friends he made this past year there and a lot of people were traveling so he felt anxious and he let that override my needs. He said if he could do it all over again he would.



I get what he’s saying but I still don’t really buy that as an acceptable excuse. This girl works at the place of one of my husband’s hobbies that I have since joined so we can’t avoid her 100%. I asked him to smooth things over with her so that things feel easy with us going there. After not being able to let my feelings go, I forced him to show me his phone. 



For a while he wouldn’t, saying that I have to trust him and that it’s a trust thing, that his friendship with her is purely platonic but I’m not going to like what I see. I pushed and eventually read all of their texts and have cried every day since. On the positive side, there are no explicit crossing of lines. True to form, it does seem purely platonic-a lot of movie/music references. No overtly negative speak about me. The thing that gets me is that they had exchanged at least one text a day since they had had coffee three weeks ago and he deliberately hid that from me.



At 1am on NYE night, when I tried to connect with him and ask him if we were talking, he said no and went to sleep. He proceeded to message her the following:



him: thx for coming out. Glad someone likes auld lang syne as much as me

her: that song slaps. Thanks for inviting me it was interesting and fascinating!

Him: idk how to take that but yw

Her: I had fun!

him: ok good

Her: did my brother and I add or detract from the vibe would you say

him: oh no absolutely added. Necessary even

her: good to hear! Was he how you expected?? 

him: sorta. He does seem older. You are definitely wayyy different

her: how sooo. He is kinda broey

Him: for sure. And you definitely aren’t lol (no offense)

Her: 💅



It hurts the most because I asked for connection and boundaries that night and he explicitly ignored me and pursued that with her.   


I cried for days and my husband is horrified with himself. He’s cried multiple times and has said there’s something wrong with him that he keeps trying to push me away. He has given me his laptop password and promises to not do any outreach. If she texts, he promised to tell and show me. I know logically that their friendship is over but I feel anxious like I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. We have a beautiful young baby and I’ve always felt like our relationship has the potential to be great but now I’m questioning when is enough enough?

1q5rybl,https://www.reddit.com/r/etiquette/comments/1q5rybl/friends_trip_what_is_normal_for_costsspending/,"Friends trip, what is normal for costs/spending?","I have a girlfriend who moved across the country from our own state. The rest of the friend group still lives in our home state. This girlfriend is really into her birthday, and since she doesn't see us in person that much, she asks that we do a yearly friends trip for her birthday so we can see each other in person. 

She doesn't like to fly, so she picks a destination that she can drive to, and she wants us each to fly into that destination. We will use her car while we are there, since she drove, so we pay her for gas and pay to wash her car at the end. 

She is also pretty particular about how she wants everything, so she picks the food, hotel and activities. We can make a suggestion, but she has ultimate say as to whether she wants that hotel/restaurant/activity. We all split the hotel (there are 4 total girls, including the birthday girl, so split 4 ways). We all pay for our own food/drinks and activity fees. Normally, I would cover meals and drinks for the birthday girl, but I typically don't in this instance since the trip was so much already. We also bring her a gift, usually in the $100 range. 

I'm not sure how other people do friend group travel, but this feels like a lot to me. It would be one thing if we picked a neutral location, and we all got input on what we eat/do, but this all seems very much for the birthday girl exclusively, even though it's being framed as a ""girl's trip."" Typically, with flights, these cost me about $3,000+ and multiple days of PTO. 

Another issue is that she gets very upset if people want to deviate from her strict schedule and itinerary. For example, she often has separate stops daily for breakfast, coffee, snack, lunch, ice cream, dinner, and drinks. Sometimes I try to decline to buy at some of these places because 1. it's too much food for me in one day, and 2. it would cost me $400 per day to get all of that food. She gets very upset and annoyed, and has openly called me cheap. I don't want to ruin anyone's birthday or be a cheap friend, but I also feel I'm not being rude to politely decline.

Is this a normal expenditure for a friend trip? None of us are wealthy, to my knowledge. I am, however, the only one with children, so that may be the disconnect for me. Is this normally how these friend trips are run? Is this polite and reasonable, or is my friend being a bit rude? She claims this is all really normal and reasonable for a friend trip, and that all girls do birthday trips for each other like this. And that she is doing us a big favor by planning all of this fun for us. I feel she thinks I'm rude and cheap at this point.

1q5ry18,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q5ry18/my_only_inheritance_was_a_book_that_bites/,My Only Inheritance was a Book that Bites,"Part 1: 



My name is Edward Owens Lockheart, my family have lived in Calamity Rock, Montana for at least 8 generations. Although The Lockhearts weren’t one of the founding families we were well respected and pretty rich. 

Why’s the town called ‘Calamity Rock’? Well, that’s a long story for another time. Short version: a long time ago a meteor hit the lake that sits in the shadows of the mountains long before there was ever a town here and the town grew up around it. 

Anyway, my family runs the chocolate factory in town, yes you heard that right, the chocolate factory.

We’re basically the closest thing to ‘Willy Wonka’ in the Northwestern US. Though my paternal grandfather was utterly devoid of any of the Wonka whimsy. He resembled Edger Allen Poe more than Gene Wilder and my grandmother looked like Baba Yaga.   
She was your standard doting grandma: constantly giving my sister and I gifts or random candy which drove my mother insane.

Well I’m not here to discuss my childhood though even growing up in a backwoods town like Calamity Rock I’ve got a few stories to tell. 

No.

I’m here to talk about what happened when my grandma lay on her deathbed and how my share of the inheritance would change the course of my future. 

Grandma Lockheart, who we called Gemma (I know, I know, save your laughs), was a veritable Ironwoman. She was the type of old bat who never got sick a day in her life and her husband was the same up until his sudden death from sepsis from a hand wound he had gotten while on an inspection tour of the factory. 

Gemma was dying of approximately the same thing, but she had somehow lost both of her hands and the factory had to be closed for a few days after the accident. My sister, Felicity and I, had no idea what could have possibly taken her hands on an inspection (Felicity had taken over the factory upon graduating college the year previous), but our mother seemed to have some idea and she was as closed-mouthed as the grave. 

I remember Gemma’s bedside, the thin bed curtains on her four poster bed fluttering in the early autumn breeze filtering in through the open window, the half-filled glass of water on her bedside table after taking her medication, and my stone-faced, stoic mother sitting across the room, crossing her arms by the closed bedroom door. 

Gemma had already spoken to Felicity and explained her part of the inheritance, she received the ‘keys to the kingdom’ so to speak and would take over the Lockheart family business. 

You’d think as the eldest son this would seem unfair, like I got ‘passed over ‘ or something, but I didn’t. I didn’t want to take over the factory, I didn’t want anything to do with it to be honest. My plans consisted of escaping Calamity Rock altogether and finding a life further south.

I’d be happy to stop freezing my unmentionables off every winter, and to be away from my family’s weird legacy. 

Back to Gemma’s deathbed.

She waved me close and grabbed my hand in her ice-cold claws. Her whisper tickled my ear and of course her advanced age meant that it wasn’t really a whisper; more like a conversational shout. 

“Now Edward, you listen close to Gemma. You’ve always been a good boy, a reliable boy. I need you to take on an important role in the family.” Her voice creaked like an old board under a heavy tread. 

I smiled down at her and hoped that she wouldn’t notice that my smile was more of a grimace. 

She gripped my hand hard, something in that grip gave me chills, not just the cold of her hands with life ebbing out of them, and not just the vice-like pincers calling back to being in trouble in childhood, but the tone of her voice—It had a graveyard knell to it, a sonorous tone that hearkened back to centuries of bestowal. 

I hated it. I hated her. 

“In the attic of the main office inside the factory, behind a false panel sixteen steps in and four steps to the left,”---I could see my mother go pale and begin to rise in shock from her chair—”Under the panel is a chest. It will be locked but you will know how to open it,”---My mother ran to the bedside and grabbed Gemma’s frail shoulder so hard I heard the bone pop but the old woman continued unfazed—”Inside will be a book, it is your charge until you too lie on your deathbed. Read it and know your purpose as the eldest son of the Lockhearts…” 

My mother tried to silence her, but to no use. Her piece said, her last inheritance bestowed, she had sunk into her plush pillow—dead—as if her instructions to me had drawn the last breaths from her body. 

My mother stopped shaking the corpse and slowly let go. She turned to me like her joints had suddenly turned to wood. The look on her face spoke of horror; it made my soul shudder. 



For the next few weeks following the funeral, (a fairly fancy affair considering the honorable Lockheart name and estate), I ignored Gemma’s instruction and went about my business. My plans to move away shortly after her death (hoping to have a share in the *monetary* portion of the estate to start a new life elsewhere), had come to a screeching halt, like a train laying on the brakes. 

My mother had not spoken to me beyond the bare necessities of day-to-day life since Gemma’s death. Every time she looked at me I felt like rotting garbage. Her gaze stabbed into me like I was the lowest piece of scum on the earth, like I was mold growing in the corner of her immaculate shower. 

I wanted to get out of the house. I grabbed my keys and put on my heavy coat. The coffee shop on the corner of Byron Street would do. 

A small dusting of snow covered the ground as a gentle sheet and still fell in a gentle deluge. It would lay thick by the time I figured I would go home. My mother went to bed late. 

My car started with a gentle rumble and I turned up the heat and put on some loud music, it didn’t even really matter what music, I just needed something to drown out my thoughts. They were all of my grandmother’s instructions.

As much as I tried they wouldn’t stop; they nagged at the corners of my thoughts the longer I ignored them. Like a song that gets stuck in your head, an earworm that drives you crazy but you can’t help singing it eventually. 

I knew I would go up into that attic.

I knew I would find that secret panel.

I knew I would know how to unlock the chest. 

I knew I would find the book Gemma had told me was my inheritance.

But not tonight. Tonight I was going to get some hot coffee at 6pm in the evening and be up until 2am in the morning on the caffeine. 



The Poet's Heart, in spite of the ostentatious name, was no different than any other small town coffee shop. A lot of shades of brown and some yellow filled the eyes of each customer and the polished wood tables and chairs sat unadorned and ready for use. Why did coffee shops stay open so late? It seemed like a siren call to the perpetually caffeinated and sleepless to be able to have their fix in spite of the damage long insomnia would wreak upon their bodies and minds. 

But what did I care? I was among those lured by the siren call into the depths of coffee and milk that would soothe my pounding head, ever in need of stimulation like most of the young. Stones and glass houses and all that. 

I went up to the counter, clean and polished like always, and ordered my usual. It had already been rung up before I had finished speaking the spell of my order. The baristas knew me well here. Many a time I had shadowed their doorstep and lounged up the highly sought after cushion chairs in the corner of the Café. 

They conjured my flat white with two pumps of caramel syrup with all the grace of the nymphs of old Greece mixing ambrosial wine for the gods. I love this place. 

The first sip of coffee calmed the railing in my brain and dulled the edges of the seeming need to follow Gemma's instructions. I now somewhat understood how alcoholics felt, though I never touched the stuff after an uncle of mine had drunk himself into going into one of the caves in the mountains, raving about some “Eye” that kept watching him. 

Anyway, my coffee sipped, my mind somewhat cleared, I could finally have a moment of peace. 

I addressed the problem at hand: how to make enough money to get out of this town and never come back. 

My thoughts drifted back to the book. Maybe it was some valuable relic that I could sell to a collector and make millions! That would be too convenient, but I'd keep that as a final resort.

A job here in town? Perhaps, but that would delay my leaving by months, maybe even years. I could work for Felicity at the factory. She would undoubtedly give me a job, with high pay and benefits too. But if I did that I might convince my mother that I meant to make a life here and she may get ideas into her head to try to marry me off to one of the scions of another old and distinguished Calamity Rock inhabitant. 

Why would that be so bad you ask? Well, it’s true that I could end up married to a wealthy bombshell here in town and have a life of relative ease. This town wasn’t like other small towns where all the legacy inhabitants were inbred. No, this place had a thriving trade with the outside world for its entire life as a community, and now there was tourism as well after the town’s golden age had passed in the early 1900’s. 

Well the truth was that I wanted to settle down and start a family, I was a pretty simple man all things considered, but not here. 

Never. Here.

I hated this place with a burning passion, I hated my family (except Felicity), I hated Calamity Rock, I hated Montana, I hated all of it. 

This place has too many secrets, too many whispered conversations, too many places you could go and never come back like my uncle had…

No. 

Calamity Rock was not a good place to start a family, to live the rest of my life.

All this whirled through my head with the headiness of the now-drained coffee mug. I hadn’t realized I had drunk the whole damn thing. Oh well, I could just order another one. I got Carol’s attention behind the counter. Waving my mug in mock apology, she smiled.

Carol. I would miss Carol when I left this place. 

She had short black hair cropped close to her shoulders and always wore black lipstick. But that’s where her Goth phase must have ended because she always wore bright colors, pastels, and florals. Right now she was in a cream sweater under her work apron (which I thought was a bold move considering how easily an errant spill of coffee would stain that thing), and she looked gorgeous.

She always had a brilliant smile, the whitest teeth I’ve ever seen and dark eyes that looked like melted chocolate under the warm coffee-shop lights. 

I took all this in as she walked up to my table and took my mug, flash-banging me with a smile. 

“Another coffee Ed?” she asked in an almost concerned tone, glancing up at the clock. It was almost 8pm by this point (the Café stayed open pretty late since plenty of people worked nights in town). 

That was another thing to love about Carol, she never called me ‘Edward’ like everyone else did, even my close friends. My mother had once berated my middle school best friend for trying to shorten my name and word must have spread. 

But Carol wasn’t like that. I returned her smile, a rare, genuine one coming from me. “I’d love another, I had already planned to stay up late tonight.” 

She shrugged and made off with the empty mug to work her barista magic until it was full again. 

I sat looking at the empty table for a moment. The problem of money still lay unsolved like an unfinished puzzle laid out before me on the polished wood surface. None of my ideas seemed like a solution but I had to think of *something*. 

*“In the attic of the main office inside the factory, behind a false panel sixteen steps in and four steps to the left—-”*

I almost jumped out of my seat and my skin. The whisper hadn’t been audible, at least the person sitting one table away from me didn’t react to it. But it had been as clear as day to me. It was like my grandmother was saying those words into my ear again. 

Okay, maybe another coffee wasn’t the best idea after all. The caffeine jitters were turning into auditory hallucinations, I wasn’t sure if that was normal, I’m not a doctor or anything. I received another jolt when Carol set the mug down in front of me. She had probably said something before getting close so that she wouldn’t startle me but I hadn’t heard so I jumped again, almost upending the new mug of coffee.

“Oh, sorry Carol.” I said, wiping up the slight spill. “I’m a bit jumpy tonight and lost in my own thoughts.”

She looked at me for a moment. I smiled back, trying to hide everything behind that one, flimsy smile. 

She nodded and put her hand on my shoulder, I had been wrong, she liked wearing dark nail polish too. 

“I know it’s been a few weeks since your grandma passed, but if you need anything, please let me know.” She said, genuine concern in her voice. 

I stopped smiling and dropped my eyes from her gaze. “I will, thanks a lot Carol, I mean it.”

She turned to go back to her work and I felt terrible. Not everyone in this town was my enemy, some truly were kind and generous people. 

But I still had to leave. Maybe I could somehow convince Carol to leave with me—well, at least when I finally came up with a plan for how to actually accomplish that exodus…



I left the coffee shop somewhere around 11pm. I was right about the snow, a steady even layer had settled on the town, I had to scrap off my windshield and crank the heater to defrost but that was par for the course. While I waited I checked my phone, no messages. My mother hadn’t texted me in weeks; she used to text me when I was out late asking when I would be home, that had slowed when I got my own car and had slowed further when I graduated college. The well of her motherly concern for her only son had seemingly dried up completely the day Gemma had imparted my ‘inheritance’. 

I sighed, things wouldn’t get better. I had tried to talk to my mom after Gemma’s death and asked her all kinds of questions; she had answered none of them and now would barely speak to me at all.

I shifted my car to ‘drive’ and backed out of the Café parking space. The way home from the Poet’s Heart was so ingrained that I had basically turned off my brain to keep any thoughts of my grandmother or her instructions far from my mind. It was like a floating piece of garbage that I kept trying to push beneath the surface of a pond. 

I put the car in park about 10 minutes later. I got out of the car gingerly to avoid slipping as my boot went about 5 inches into the blanket of snow on the pavement. 

Then my brain snapped on like a breaker flipping. I wasn’t at my house.

I was at the Lockheart Chocolate Factory

Had to move back in with family where my toxic dynamic with my sister restarted. I went from having my own place to sleeping on a mattress in a room my mother and I share because there isn't any place in the house for me. 

Never really had friends and finally felt like I made some good ones, but I got played by a guy that I shared the the friend group with. He did his best to make sure that the others start excluding me from hangouts. Lost those friends in the process. 

Dropped out of therapy and the gym because I don't have a job and can't afford it. Some of my friends do reach out to ask me to hang out but I honestly don't have the money to go get coffee or hang out with them. 

Been applying to places, don't hear back from them or even if I do, I don't make it past the first interview. 

I have a job interview tomorrow and they are offering me a pay that's 80% less than what I used to make, that's if I get the job. It's making me worried about how that will look on my resume. 

As someone who's sense of self was always tied with my ability to earn and who held jobs consistently since I was 18, this whole thing shook me to my core. I also dropper out of college and never got my degree. Been thinking about going back to school but again, I need money and for that I need a job. 

At 35, I didn't think this was how my life would turn out. That I would be struggling for money, lose my friends and be rejected by a guy I liked.

But I use my 30 minute lunch to do a moderately paced walk outside around my office building.

It’s only my second day doing this but I’m such a negative person and wonder if this is worth doing long term.  I cut out most snacks and the few I have are fruit.  I eat mostly protein and vegetables.  I’ve cut back on alcohol.  I do slip up with snacks sometimes but that has more to do with where I work versus home life.  I work for a broker for food vendors and we’re often their guinea pigs for new snacks.  You’re not really obligated to eat everything but if your own clients offer you something, it’ll look really bad if you don’t try it unless you have a food allergy.

1q5rrz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce_Women/comments/1q5rrz2/passive_anxious_and_emotionally_dysregulated/,"Passive, anxious, and emotionally dysregulated partner - should I stay or leave?","I’m 38, my husband is 43, and I’ve been married for 4 years (together for 8). I’ve been seeing a lot of relationship content lately, and I was wondering if I've been in the wrong relationship.

I’ve been putting this off because, deep down, I think I already know the answer - but it’s painful. I also feel vulnerable sharing this and worried about judgment for staying as long as I have.

The dynamic:  
He’s passive, anxious, conflict-avoidant, and approval-seeking. He grew up with a micromanaging, emotionally unavailable mom and was bullied. He’s generous and caring-pays all the bills, does chores without being asked, basically a “yes man.” He also steps up with family responsibilities, which I appreciate. He’s currently in therapy, but I feel resentful it took him so long to get there, and he didn’t want therapy until things got serious.

When he’s not stressed, he’s great: drives long hours for me, quit his job to move with me, does chores, pays bills. These moments make it very hard to leave.

But when he’s anxious, confronted, or under stress, everything falls apart. He gets defensive, dysregulated, and sometimes disrespectful. That’s when I feel alone and doubt the relationship.

Some personal context:  
I’ve done schema therapy. My core wounds: emotional deprivation, defectiveness, mistrust/abuse, childhood parentification. I’m highly sensitive (HSP) and tend to amplify negatives. People’s facial expressions affect me deeply, and rudeness can ruin my day.

His passivity triggers my “I’m alone and must handle everything” wound. My control and criticism trigger his “I’m not good enough” wound.

I make most decisions, earn much more than him, and feel like the leader in everything - life planning, travel, logistics, responsibility. I’m naturally more driven than him, which frustrates me. It mirrors my childhood and family dynamics, and I also feel pressure from the fear of running out of time to find the right man.

Serious issues:

* Gaslighting & finances (3 years ago): He bought a second-hand car without consulting me (we have separate finances) and gaslighted me for three days. I sometimes critique his financial choices, his response seemed like a way to regain control- but it hurt deeply due to lying and his manipulation. I had to hold his hand to make him comfortable and finally tell the truth. 

Conflict & emotional dysregulation (3 incidents):

1. Wednesday / Period: I was on my period and upset about the bathroom. During an argument, I said my stomach hurt, and he said “Goddamit” while still trying to care for me. I felt overwhelmed and ran to a hotel. At the time, I was working two jobs, not because I had to, but because I wanted to, so I was exhausted.
2. McDonald’s / Interview: While traveling and I know he's tired, I asked the same question 3 times, and he rolled his eyes. Other times, he seemed burdened by simple tasks, like driving me to an interview or commenting on traffic lights while sighing. I confronted him once and saw him banging the steering wheel, which upset me deeply.
3. Pre-planned trip / hike: I wanted him to take initiative. In the morning, he sometimes gathered items, packed bags, made food - sometimes inconsistently.

* We went to the wrong parking lot, adding extra walking, and I felt frustrated.
* Conflict escalated: he tried to apologize twice, I yelled, he kicked sand, I threw coffee milk, he retrieved it and said “It’s my favorite milk,” which showed some emotional regulation.
* After the trip, I became very anxious and thought I noticed him looking at other women multiple times, which would be unusual behavior for him. I don’t actually think he did it-he’s not that kind of man. I immediately booked a trip home, which made him upset.
* During a hike, I misread his actions (opening a door), screamed, cried, and he tried to record me to gain control. He immediately deleted it and apologize. I was shocked.

Incompatibility patterns:

* Decision-making: I need initiative; he’s passive and often needs reminders. I wonder if I’m pushing him to be someone he’s not.
* Conflict style: I need calm, validation, and problem-solving. He escalates quickly and focuses on his feelings, which triggers my abandonment fears.
* Honesty: I need honesty and clarity; he sometimes deflects, minimizes, or avoids issues.

I’m financially independent and could leave safely. The hardest part is losing him as my best friend - the version who shows up, tries, and doesn’t leave.

We currently live separately due to escalations (my lease is up in April), see each other a few times a week, and he helps with chores.

Questions I’m struggling with:

* Should I stay or leave?
* If I leave, how do I make sure I won’t regret it? I’ve regretted leaving a past relationship where the man seemed compatible in leadership, empathy, and initiative, but our life goals differed. That regret has stayed with me for a very long time, even now.
* Am I asking too much? Given my age, financial independence, and the qualities I want (initiative, leadership, emotional intelligence, honesty, loyalty, care for family, generosity, drive), maybe someone like this is rare. How do I make peace with being alone at 60?
* Should I focus on not triggering him, enjoy his positive traits, and put my energy into personal projects (content creation) until I feel fully ready to leave?

What struck me from relationship:

* Even though he has changed in some ways, I’m still resentful. Therapy has helped, but it makes me ask - why did it take so long?
* I wonder if I’ve been disrespecting myself by staying so long.

1q5rrao,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeLonghi/comments/1q5rrao/cant_get_a_decent_espresso_from_my_delonghi/,"Can’t get a decent espresso from my De’Longhi Dedica Duo, what am I missing ?","I bought a Dedica Duo for Christmas, but I haven’t managed to get a drinkable coffee from it so far.

I buy whole beans and have them ground directly at the local roaster. I’ve tested several grind sizes, but without any success or noticeable change in the result. There is still one grind size left to try, but it’s extremely fine and I would expect it to clog the filter, which doesn’t make much sense to me.

The coffee flows through in just a few seconds (11), which feels far too fast. The result is always the same: the coffee is very acidic, extremely light in color, and has no crema at all. All of these tests were done using the pressurized filter. I contacted De’Longhi support, but the response time has been very slow.

I then ordered a non-pressurized filter to test with the finest grind available. The result is the same: the coffee tastes bad, runs too fast, splashes everywhere, is still very acidic, too pale, and produces no crema. I understand that getting good results with a non-pressurized filter is more difficult, but I can’t even get a decent coffee with the stock pressurized filter.

What also confuses me is that I’ve tested multiple grind sizes down to 1.5 (according to the roaster’s scale), and the coffee is always bad. Meanwhile, a much coarser grind (around 4.5) works perfectly fine on a friend’s father’s Dedica machine—an older version with the old steam wand.

At this point, I’m struggling to understand where the problem is coming from: the grind, the machine, or something else entirely.",2,1767726511.0,DeLonghi,2,1.0,False

The games you want from me must be redeemed soon. I can't vouch for a key's validity when you keep it stored for longer without redeeming. One of the reasons why: Some Game Developers had started to revoke unused keys some time after their expiration date. Sadly, this seems to turn into a growing trend with game keys.

The app is called SmartBudget and is an app that automates and helps people do budgeting, helping them keep track of all income and expenses.

Key Features:

* Subscription and bill tracking
* Detailed budgeting categories (including creating custom categories)
* Receipt scanning
* Auto categorisation on expenses 
* Calendar reminders for upcoming bills
* Savings goals with progress tracking
* Monthly overviews and spending insights with AI

This is my first time building and launching an app, and I was curious what the next steps are, as far as coding and improvement. I'm hopeful that my first clients will give me the first ""what to improve"" reviews. How did you guys manage to release and scale an app within the first month of launching?

we will see a new version of The Book of Mormon soon.

# Phone Addiction: Recognizing the Signs and Finding Solutions

https://preview.redd.it/uz2v71tm1sbg1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa943b05e2a8695718d531a37be65a181bf4454e



I’ve noticed many people glued to their phones these days, myself included sometimes. It made me think about when that habit shifts from normal use to something more serious. It’s easy to get caught up in the digital world, but when does it become a problem? This article is my attempt to explore the signs that someone addicted to phones might be struggling and what we can do about it.

# Key Takeaways

* Phone addiction, or problematic smartphone use, is a compulsive reliance on phones that interferes with daily life and functioning.
* Signs include excessive use, neglecting responsibilities, loss of interest in other activities, and experiencing withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety when disconnected.
* The dopamine reward loop and fear of missing out (FOMO) are psychological factors that drive compulsive phone checking.
* Strategies to address this include establishing usage boundaries, creating tech-free zones, and substituting screen time with other activities.
* Seeking professional help through therapy, mindfulness, or support groups can be highly effective for those struggling with phone addiction.

# Understanding the Signs of a Person Addicted to Their Phone

It’s easy to get caught up in our phones these days. I know I do. Sometimes I look up and realize I’ve been scrolling much longer than I intended. But when does that casual use turn into something more serious, like an addiction? It’s not just about how much time we spend staring at the screen; it’s about how it impacts our lives and our well-being.

# What Defines Phone Addiction?

Phone addiction, sometimes called problematic smartphone use, isn’t officially listed in the major diagnostic manuals, but it feels very real for many of us. It’s essentially a compulsive need to use our phones that starts to interfere with our daily routines and responsibilities. Think of it like other habits that can get out of control, where you just can’t seem to stop, even when you know it’s causing issues. It’s that strong urge to constantly check for updates, messages, or just to see what’s happening online, even when there’s nothing new.

# Understanding Compulsive Checking Behaviors

One of the clearest signs is the constant urge to check your phone. You might find yourself picking it up automatically, maybe every few minutes. It’s like a reflex. You may feel a little anxious or restless if you can’t check it, even if you’re in the middle of a conversation or a task. This isn’t just about staying connected; it’s a habit that can be tough to break.

Here are some typical behaviors I’ve observed:

* Constantly checking for notifications even when your phone hasn’t buzzed.
* Feeling anxious or restless when you can’t reach your phone.
* Spending more time on your phone than intended, often losing track of time.
* Bringing your phone everywhere, even into the bathroom or bed.

>

# Identifying Symptoms of Withdrawal

When someone is highly dependent on their phone, not having it can cause uncomfortable feelings. It’s similar to how someone might feel if they can’t have their usual coffee or cigarette. You might feel:

* Irritable or moody.
* Feeling anxious or stressed.
* Restless or unable to focus.
* Feeling sad or down.

These feelings strongly suggest that the phone has become more than just a tool; it has become something your brain depends on for comfort or stimulation. If you notice these reactions in yourself or someone you know, it’s definitely worth paying attention to.

# Behavioral Signs of Phone Addiction

https://preview.redd.it/fwsde4fp1sbg1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=355c60f3102a35aeac70abbc5040284d4c23178a



Sometimes, it’s not just about how much time I spend on my phone, but how that time begins to change my behavior and impact my life. I’ve noticed certain patterns in myself and others that clearly indicate a problem.

# Excessive Use and Neglected Responsibilities

This is probably the clearest sign. I find myself spending hours scrolling through feeds or playing games, and suddenly, I realize I haven’t done the dishes, answered important emails, or even cooked dinner. It’s as if time just slips away. **My phone use has started to take precedence over things that once mattered to me.** This can extend to work or school, where deadlines are missed, or the quality of my work drops because I’m constantly distracted or trying to squeeze in a few more minutes on my device. It’s not just about being busy; it’s about deliberately choosing the phone over responsibilities, even when I know I shouldn’t.

# Loss of Interest in Other Activities

Remember how I used to love reading or going for hikes? Lately, those things feel like chores. The quick gratification I get from my phone, whether it’s a new notification or an interesting post, is just more appealing than anything else. I’ve noticed that activities I once enjoyed now seem dull or require too much effort compared to the effortless engagement my phone provides. It’s a slow fade, where hobbies and social outings get pushed aside because they don’t offer the same instant reward as my digital world. This loss of engagement with the real world is a big red flag for me.

# Relationship Strain from Device Use

This is hard to admit, but I’ve definitely felt the tension. Conversations with friends or family often get interrupted by my phone buzzing, or I catch myself zoning out, half-listening while I check something online. It makes the people around me feel ignored and unimportant. I’ve seen situations where people are physically together but mentally miles apart, each lost in their own screen. This constant distraction can cause arguments and create a feeling of disconnect, even when I’m with the ones I care about most. Maintaining strong relationships becomes difficult when your focus is often elsewhere. It’s a cycle that’s hard to break, especially with FOMO so strong it makes disconnecting tough.

Here’s a brief overview of how this could show up:

* **Missed Social Cues:** Often missing non-verbal cues from others because you’re looking at your phone.
* **Prioritizing Digital Interactions:** Choosing to message or interact online instead of talking to the person directly in front of you.
* **Arguments About Phone Use:** Frequent disagreements with loved ones over the time spent on devices.
* **Decreased Quality Time:** Spending time with others but being mentally absent because of phone distractions.

# Psychological Factors of Phone Addiction

It’s easy to dismiss excessive phone use as just a bad habit, but there’s a lot happening beneath the surface. I’ve noticed that the way my brain reacts to my phone is quite similar to how it might respond to other things that are hard to put down. It all relates to how our brains are wired.

# The Dopamine Reward Cycle

Think about that little ping when you get a notification. That’s not just a sound; it’s a signal to your brain that something potentially rewarding is happening. Every like, comment, or message can trigger a release of dopamine, a chemical that makes us feel good. This creates a loop: I check my phone, I get a small reward (dopamine), I feel good, so I want to check my phone again. **This cycle is a major driver behind compulsive phone checking.** It’s like a tiny hit that keeps me coming back for more, even when I know I should be doing something else. It’s a powerful mechanism that can be tough to break, making it hard to step away from the screen.

# Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)

Then there’s that nagging feeling that something important is happening online that I’m missing out on. **This fear of missing out, or FOMO, is a powerful psychological trigger**. I find myself scrolling through social media not because I’m especially interested, but because I’m worried I’ll miss an important update, a funny meme, or an invitation. This anxiety keeps me glued to my device, constantly checking for updates to make sure I’m ‘in the loop.’ It’s a steady hum of low-level stress that only eases when I’m actively engaged with my phone.

# Emotional Distress When Disconnected

When I have to be away from my phone, even briefly, I feel it. It’s not just boredom; it’s a real sense of unease. I might become restless, irritable, or even a little anxious. It feels like a part of me is missing, and I don’t quite know how to handle it. This discomfort clearly shows that my relationship with my phone has gone past simple convenience and has turned into dependence. It reveals how much I rely on my device for comfort, distraction, or a sense of identity. This emotional reliance can make it very hard to disconnect, even when I see the negative effects on my life. Many people face this struggle, and understanding these psychological roots is the first step toward finding a healthier balance.

# Strategies to Overcome Phone Addiction

It’s easy to get caught up in our phones, and I know I have. But when it starts taking over, it’s time to make some changes. The good news is, there are practical steps I can take to better manage my usage and develop a healthier relationship with my device. It’s not about ditching technology completely, but about finding a balance that works for me.

# Setting Clear Usage Boundaries

One of the first things I’ve found helpful is to establish some rules for myself. This means deciding when and for how long I’ll use my phone for non-essential tasks. For example, I’ve started setting a daily screen time limit. It isn’t always easy to follow, but having a goal makes a difference. I’ve also found it useful to designate specific times and places where phones are off-limits. Think about mealtimes or the hour before bed – these are perfect times to disconnect and be present. Communicating these boundaries to friends and family has also been important; letting them know I’m trying to cut back helps them understand if I’m not as responsive.

# Creating Tech-Free Zones

Beyond just setting time limits, I’ve been creating physical spaces in my home where my phone isn’t allowed. My bedroom is a prime example. Keeping my phone out of the bedroom has significantly improved my sleep quality. It’s incredible how much better I feel when I’m not tempted to scroll right before trying to fall asleep. This concept can also apply to other areas, like the dinner table or even a specific chair in the living room. Making these zones clear helps train my brain to associate those areas with [unplugged](https://healthyrelaxation.com/the-essential-guide-to-a-digital-detox/) activities.

# Replacing Screen Time with Alternative Activities

This is where I’ve had to get a bit creative. When I feel that urge to pick up my phone, I try to have something else ready to go. For me, this often means getting some exercise. A quick walk outside or even just some stretching can really shift my focus. I’ve also been making an effort to connect with people face-to-face more often, which is so much more rewarding than endless scrolling. Pursuing old hobbies, like reading or trying out new recipes, has also been a great way to fill that time. It’s about finding activities that genuinely bring me joy and a sense of accomplishment, giving me a healthier way to get that feel-good hit. If you’re looking for ways to relax and find calm, exploring free wellness tools like those on [HealthyRelaxation.com](http://HealthyRelaxation.com) can be a good starting point.

>

Here’s a brief look at some alternative activities I’m exploring:

* **Physical Activity:** Going for walks, cycling, or doing home workouts.
* **Social Connection:** Meeting friends for coffee, calling family, or joining a local club.
* **Hobbies & Creativity:** Reading books, playing an instrument, gardening, or drawing.
* **Mindfulness Practices:** Try out meditation or deep breathing exercises.

# Seeking Professional Help for Phone Addiction

Sometimes, no matter how hard I try, I just can’t break free from my phone habits on my own. That’s when I realize it’s time to seek outside help. It’s not a sign of weakness, honestly; it’s a smart move. There are professionals who truly know how to help people like me gain control of this.

# Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Methods

One of the most common ways therapists assist with phone addiction is through something called [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy](https://healthyrelaxation.com/cbt-benefits-techniques/), or CBT. It sounds fancy, but basically, it’s about understanding why I reach for my phone so often and then changing my thoughts and actions about it. My therapist might help me identify triggers, like feeling bored or stressed, that make me want to scroll. Then, we work on finding better ways to handle those feelings instead of just grabbing my phone. It’s about retraining my brain to respond differently. They might give me homework, like setting small goals to reduce screen time or practicing specific coping skills when I feel the urge. It’s a structured approach to tackling the problem, and I’ve found it really helps me understand my own patterns.

# The Role of Mindfulness Techniques

Mindfulness is another big one. It’s all about being present and aware of what I’m doing, without judging myself. When I practice mindfulness, I start to notice *when* I’m mindlessly picking up my phone. It could be simple things like taking a few deep breaths before I unlock my screen or doing a quick body scan to see how I’m feeling. These little pauses can make a huge difference. It helps me feel more in control and less like my phone is controlling me. It’s not about never using my phone, but about using it intentionally. I’ve found that even just a few minutes of mindful breathing can help calm that urge to check notifications constantly. It’s a way to reconnect with myself and the world around me, not just the digital one.

# Family Therapy and Support Groups

Sometimes, the problem isn’t just mine alone. My phone habits can affect my family, and their reactions can affect me too. That’s where family therapy comes in. Talking with a therapist together can help us all understand each other better and figure out how to create a more supportive home environment. We can set rules as a family, like having phone-free dinners or keeping phones out of bedrooms at night. Support groups are also incredibly helpful. It’s comforting to connect with other people who are going through the same thing. We share stories, tips, and just offer each other encouragement. Knowing I’m not the only one struggling makes a big difference. You can often find local groups or even online communities dedicated to managing digital habits.

# Using Resources to Manage Phone Usage

It can feel overwhelming to cut back on phone use, especially when so much of our lives are connected to our devices these days. However, I’ve discovered that the right tools and resources can genuinely help. It’s not about going completely cold turkey, but about finding a healthier balance.

# Leveraging Usage Tracking Apps

Honestly, my first step was simply figuring out *how much* I was really using my phone. I downloaded a few apps that track screen time, and the results were eye-opening. Seeing the hours laid out clearly really put things into perspective. These apps can show you which apps you spend the most time on and even provide daily or weekly summaries. **This kind of data is very helpful for spotting patterns and areas where you might be losing track of time.** Some apps even let you set daily limits for specific apps, which I found very useful for social media.

Here’s a quick overview of what these apps can provide:

* **Screen Time Reports:** Daily, weekly and monthly breakdowns of your usage.
* **App Timers:** Set limits on how long you can use specific apps each day.
* **Downtime Schedules:** Lock access to apps and notifications during specific hours.
* **Usage Alerts:** Get alerts when you’re nearing your limits.

# Online Resources and Self-Help Books

Beyond apps, there’s a whole world of information out there. I’ve spent time reading articles and blog posts about digital well-being, and it’s been eye-opening. Many websites provide practical tips and strategies for managing phone usage. I also found a couple of self-help books that offer different perspectives and exercises. It’s helpful to remember that you’re not alone in this, and many people share what has worked for them.

Some recurring themes I’ve noticed in these resources include:

* Identifying personal triggers for excessive phone use, such as boredom or stress.
* Developing alternative coping strategies that don’t involve your phone.
* Strategies for setting aside tech-free times and spaces during your day.
* Understanding the psychological aspects of phone use, such as the reward cycle.

# The Value of Expert Advice

While self-help resources are valuable, I also understand that sometimes you need extra support. If I were really struggling, I wouldn’t hesitate to seek professional help. Therapists who focus on behavioral issues or addiction can offer personalized strategies and support that surpass what a book or app can deliver. They can help you identify the underlying causes of your phone use and create a plan tailored to your specific needs. It’s important to recognize when to ask for help, and there’s absolutely no shame in doing so.

Managing your phone use can be difficult, but there are smart ways to make it easier. Think about setting specific times to check messages or use apps. You can also find enjoyable activities that don’t involve screens. Ready to take control?

# Moving Forward

It’s clear that phone addiction is real, and I’ve learned a lot about how to identify it and what actions to take. Recognizing the signs in ourselves or others is the first, important step. From there, it’s about making small, steady changes. Setting boundaries, exploring new hobbies, and possibly talking to someone can make a big difference. I understand it’s not always easy, but reclaiming control from our phones is definitely worth it for a healthier, more present life.

# Frequently Asked Questions

# What exactly counts as being addicted to my phone?

It’s more than just frequently using your phone. I’d say I’m addicted if I can’t stop myself from checking my phone, even when I know I shouldn’t. It begins to interfere with my schoolwork, friendships, or even how much sleep I get. If I feel really anxious or irritable when I can’t use my phone, those are strong signs too.

# How can I tell if my constant phone checking is a problem?

If I catch myself automatically grabbing my phone to scroll through social media or check notifications even when there’s nothing new, that’s a red flag. It feels like a reflex I can’t control. I might do it without thinking, like when I’m waiting in line or during conversations. If this happens often, it’s probably more than just casual use.

# What happens if I can’t use my phone for a while?

When I can’t reach my phone, I start to feel very uneasy. It’s like a persistent feeling that I’m missing out on something important. I might feel restless, get easily annoyed, or have trouble concentrating on anything else. Sometimes, I even feel a bit down or panicked if I think I’ve lost connection.

# How can I start using my phone less?

To start, I need to establish some firm rules for myself. For example, I can choose not to use my phone during meals or for an hour before I go to bed. Turning off notifications for apps that aren’t very important can also be very helpful. It’s about making intentional decisions to put the phone down.

# Are there specific places or times I should avoid using my phone?

Definitely. Creating ‘tech-free zones’ is a good idea. My bedroom is a prime example; I shouldn’t have my phone there, especially at night, so I can actually sleep. Also, during family dinners or when I’m hanging out with friends, I should try to keep my phone put away, so I can be present.

# What if I’ve tried to cut back but can’t seem to do it?

If I’ve tried on my own and it’s just not working, it’s okay to ask for help. Talking to a counselor or therapist who understands these kinds of issues can make a big difference. They can provide strategies and support that I might not find on my own, helping me understand why I rely on my phone so much and how to change that.

1q5rmuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bazzite/comments/1q5rmuj/no_hdmi_audio_with_hp_intel_mini_pc_effort_post/,No HDMi Audio with HP intel mini PC - Effort Post,"Hey everyone, I was trying to get Bazzite running on an HP pro 400 mini G5 with a intel-9100 (Coffee Lake) processor and UHD 630 integrated graphics. I installed base bazzite with KDE to run some light gaming and stream from my powerful PC in my basement. I just wanted to have easier access to my steam library for my very limited free time. Unfortunately, I ran into a major issue where my audio would not work over HDMI and did a lot of digging to try and find an answer.  

I have been wrestling with this for weeks trying everything I could find on Reddit and other forums with no luck. Finally last night and did a huge deep dive with my friend Chat GPT trying to resolve the issue once and for all... only to find that I'm pretty much out of luck. But keep reading if you have a similar issue. These might have a solution that works for you.

Before trying anything else, I recommend to people ensure they are hooked up directly to their TV with a good HDMI cable, then try these simple steps 

\- put the pc to sleep, then wake it up and check for the option in the audio menu

\- hook up a BT speaker / headphones which should refresh audio options and you may have the HDMI option appear in your menu (this worked for me once but never again after I tested re-starting the PC)

If the above options fail, run command

    sudo dmesg | grep -iE ""snd|hda|hdmi""

and look for the HDMI connection to see if your system even sees the output. My output had the HDMI at the bottom with error code

`snd_hda_codec_intelhdmi hdaudioC0D2: HDMI: pin NID 0x7 not registered`

ChatGPT says this message implies that the codec is present but the bios never exposes a valid HDMI pin to the OS. So I tried a few more things to enable the kernel and BIOS to work together:

\- Evaluated all audio options in BIOS to see if they were interfering (Audio device: enabled, internal speaker: Enabled, Embedded audio: enabled, enable Legacy audio, etc)

\- Downgrading to the lowest available BIOS from HP to try and see if the HDMI would work with an older version (R23 02.11.00)

\- Upgrading to the latest BIOS version to see if capability was reinstated (R23 02.24.00)

None of these had any luck and Chat GPT ran out of ideas at this point. 

So, sorry to say, I never got the HDMI audio working and will be downgrading back to windows 11 to see if I can make the audio work there. This was supposed to be a quick and easy project and, unfortunately, I wasted a lot of time. I hope this guide helps someone spend less time evaluating their options in the future.

1q5rl9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ankle/comments/1q5rl9e/pre_and_postbrostrom/,Pre- and Post-Brostrom,"I’ve lurked in this sub for a couple of months to get an idea of what I was in for with a Brostrom procedure, and would like to contribute to the “what to expect” posts now that I’ve undergone the procedure myself. For context, I‘m a lifelong athlete who’s had a LOT of experience on crutches over the years, and I have 6 weeks of NWB and no driving ahead of me now that the surgeon has repaired the ATFL, CFL, and an 8mm x 9mm OCL in my right ankle. 

Here are my (lengthy) thoughts - YMMV

Weeks to months pre-op:  Stay active as much as you can. If your balance is not very good, do some specific work to improve your ability to balance on your healthy leg - this will be especially important if you don’t have much experience on crutches. 

1 to 2 weeks pre-op: 

\- Pay attention to your daily routine. What can you do on one leg? Where will you need more help? How will you carry things? Is there anything in your home you can remove or rearrange to make crutching around safer or less annoying? Practice going up/down stairs on crutches if that will be a new experience for you, and adjust/try out any other mobility aids you plan to use post-op (e.g., knee scooter, iWalk, etc.). 

\- Are there any accessories you might need to buy or borrow? Between amazon, fb marketplace, thrift stores, and good ol’ Craigslist, my low-cost finds included a cast cover for bathing, a shower chair, an iWalk 3.0, and a pair of wide-leg sweatpants (with pockets!). I was also able to borrow a knee scooter, crutch pads, and a detachable pouch to hang off one crutch. 

\- Finalize plans for post-op assistance from family, friends, colleagues, neighbors, etc. If applicable, make sure your job or school is tracking your upcoming absence. Don’t forget to figure out how you’ll get to work, school, etc., once your convalescent leave is up!

Surgery day:  I was lucky and got the first appointment of the day, so I was only moderately hangry and under-caffeinated when I went in. Once awake in the recovery room, all I wanted was water and some crackers. After getting home, I put my foot up, had some coffee, started getting re-hydrated, and ate a little bit at a time throughout the day. The nerve block was still going strong, so I probably moved around more than I should have.

Next day:  Sleep last night was meh - I kept waking up because I was afraid I’d lost my prop pillow or was uncomfortable from having been in one position for too long. Nerve block is still in effect, so I keep trying to do stuff myself, but family keeps telling me to knock it tf off and go lie down. Went ahead and bathed since I still can’t feel anything from my right knee to the pinky toe. Halfway through the day and getting a little bored already, but trying to appreciate the forced rest.

I was doomscrolling till 2 AM because I felt lonely, and then missing my work goals during the day because I was disorganized.

I realized that one single app couldn't fix both problems. I needed to separate my ""Emotional Brain"" from my ""Logical Brain.""

So I decided to build two completely different apps to fix my own life.

First, I built Moodie to handle the loneliness. It's an anonymous social app that matches you with people based on your current vibe. If I'm feeling anxious, I match with someone else who is anxious. We vent, we feel better, we move on. No fake Instagram lives.

Second, I built DoMind to handle the work. I got sick of subscription apps that need the internet just to load a to do list. DoMind is completely offline and private. It forces me to map out my day visually and actually focus.

I launched both recently. Moodie is free and DoMind costs about the price of a coffee per month.

It’s been a crazy experiment running two startups at once, but it honestly helped me regain some balance.

1q5rhvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q5rhvs/my_boss_gave_me_one_rule_as_a_911_dispatcher_if_a/,"My boss gave me one rule as a 911 dispatcher: if a call comes from the old house on the county line, you let it ring. Last night, I answered.","I’ve been a 911 dispatcher for twelve years, the last seven on the graveyard shift. You think you’ve heard it all after that long. The drunks, the domestics, the panicked fumbling for words after a car crash. It all becomes a kind of white noise, a rhythm of human misery you learn to navigate without letting it touch you. You have to. It's the only way to stay sane.

My district is a sprawling, sleepy county that dies after 10 p.m. It’s mostly soccer moms and retirees. The worst we usually get on a weeknight is a noise complaint or a teenager who's had too much to drink at a bonfire. The job, for me, had become a cycle of caffeine, fluorescent lights, and the low, constant hum of computer servers. I was burned out. Deeply, existentially tired in a way sleep couldn't fix. The calls were just blips on a screen, voices to be processed, categorized, and dispatched. I was a human switchboard for other people’s worst days.

The first call came on a Tuesday, about three months ago. It was 2:47 a.m. The deadest hour of the deadest night. The line lit up on my console, but not in the usual way. It wasn't a cell call with a GPS ping, or a landline with a registered address. It was just a raw signal, designated as 'unregistered VOIP.' Not unheard of, but rare. I clicked it open.

""911, what is your emergency?""

Static. A thick, wet sound, like listening to the radio underwater. It crackled and popped, and underneath it, I could just barely make out a sound. A whisper.

""...hello? Can you hear me?""

It was a child's voice. A boy, I thought. Maybe seven or eight. He sounded like he was trying to talk without moving his lips.

""This is 911,"" I repeated, my voice a little louder, a little clearer. ""I can barely hear you. What is your emergency?""

The static swelled, almost swallowing his voice whole. ""...he's back. The man in the mask is back.""

A chill, cold and sharp, went down my spine. It was a professional chill, the one that tells you this is real. This isn't a prank.

""Okay, son. Where are you? I need an address.""

""...hurting mommy,"" the whisper came again, breaking with a sob. The static sounded like a swarm of angry insects now. ""Daddy's asleep on the floor... he won't wake up.""

""Son, I need you to tell me where you are. I can't send help if I don't know where you are."" My fingers were flying across the keyboard, trying to get a trace, but the system was kicking back errors. No location data. No subscriber info. Nothing.

""The old house,"" he whispered, his voice fading. ""At the end of the road... please...""

Then the line went dead. Not a click, not a hang-up. It just ceased to exist. One moment it was there, a line of static and terror, and the next it was just a dead channel.

Even without an address, 'the old house at the end of the road' was enough. Out on the western edge of the county, there's a long, unpaved road that just sort of peters out into the woods. And at the end of it, there's one house. A big, derelict Victorian thing that’s been empty for as long as anyone can remember. It was a local legend, the kind of place kids dared each other to spend a night in.

I dispatched a patrol car. My senior officer, a guy who's been on the force since before I was born, came back over the radio about fifteen minutes later. His voice was flat, laced with the kind of annoyance reserved for rookies and time-wasters.

""Dispatch, Car 12 here. The property is secure. No signs of forced entry. Place is boarded up tighter than a drum. There's nobody here. Hasn't been for fifty years by the looks of it.""

""10-4, Car 12,"" I said, my own voice betraying none of my confusion. ""Are you sure? The caller was a child. He said his family was being attacked.""

There was a sigh over the radio. ""Listen, the dust on the porch is an inch thick. The boards on the windows are gray and rotted. If someone's in there, they're a ghost. We're clearing the call. Tell whoever's playing games to knock it off.""

I logged it as 'unfounded' and tried to put it out of my mind. A prank. A sophisticated one, maybe, using some kind of voice changer and a VOIP spoofer. Kids these days. I was too tired to care.

A week later, at 2:47 a.m., the same line lit up.

The same static. The same terrified, whispering voice.

""...he's in the house. I can hear him walking.""

This time, I felt a knot of ice form in my stomach. ""Son, is this the same caller from last week?""

A choked sob. ""He has the mask on. The one with the scary smile. Mommy's screaming.""

Faintly, through the storm of static, I thought I could hear it. A woman's scream, high and thin and distorted, like a sound being played backwards.

""I'm sending help,"" I said, my voice tight. ""Stay on the line with me. Can you hide?""

""...in the closet,"" he whispered. ""He's coming up the stairs. I can hear his feet...""

The line went dead.

I dispatched two cars this time. I told them it was a repeat call, possibly a hostage situation. I didn't want them to be complacent. They took it seriously. They set up a perimeter. They used a bullhorn. They broke down the front door.

The result was the same. An empty house. Thick, undisturbed layers of dust on every surface. Rotted floorboards, peeling wallpaper, the smell of decay and forgotten things. No footprints. No child. No man in a mask. No sign that a human being had set foot in that house in decades.

My supervisor pulled me aside the next morning. He's a large, patient man who has the weary look of someone who's seen it all twice. He told me to drop it.

""It's a glitch,"" he said, not meeting my eye. ""Some kind of cross-chatter from another jurisdiction, or a recurring electronic echo. Don't waste county resources on it. If that call comes in again, log it and move on.""

But I couldn't. The boy's voice... it was too real. The terror in it was primal. You can't fake that. Not even the best actor in the world can fake the sound of a child who thinks his mother is being murdered in the next room.

The calls kept coming. Every Tuesday, like clockwork. 2:47 a.m. Each call was a slightly different piece of the same horrible puzzle.

""...he's hurting daddy now. There's... there's so much red...""

""...mommy stopped screaming...""

""...he's looking for me. I can hear him opening doors...""

Every time, I sent a car. Every time, the result was the same. The cops got angrier. I was ""the boy who cried wolf."" My supervisor gave me a formal warning. My colleagues started looking at me funny, whispering when I walked by. They thought I was cracking up. Maybe I was. I started losing sleep. On my nights off, I'd find myself staring at the clock, my heart pounding as 2:47 a.m. approached. The silence was somehow worse than the calls.

I became obsessed. During the day, instead of sleeping, I went to the county records office. I needed to know who owned that house. The paper trail was a mess. It had been sold and resold, owned by banks and holding companies. But I kept digging backwards, through dusty ledgers and brittle property deeds. Finally, I found it. The last family to actually live there. A deed from 1968. A nice, happy family with a mom, a dad, and two kids. A boy and a girl.

That wasn't enough. I started spending my days in the library's basement, scrolling through decades of local newspapers on a squeaky, ancient microfiche reader. The stale, papery smell of the archives filled my lungs. I was looking for anything related to the house, to that family. For weeks, I found nothing. Just property tax notices and school honor rolls.

And then I found it.

An article from a cold, late autumn day in 1975. The headline was stark: ""Local Family Slain in Apparent Home Invasion.""

My blood ran cold. I zoomed in, my hands trembling as I adjusted the focus knob. The picture was grainy, black and white. It was the house. The same steep gables, the same wide porch. Police cars were parked haphazardly on the overgrown lawn.

I read the article, my heart hammering against my ribs. A husband, a wife, and their ten-year-old daughter, found dead in their home. The cause of death was... extensive. The article was vague, using phrases like ""brutal force trauma."" The police report mentioned a possible intruder, a figure a neighbor had seen fleeing into the woods, described only as a tall man wearing some kind of pale, expressionless mask.

But the last paragraph was what made me stop breathing.

""The family's eight-year-old son,"" it read, ""remains missing. Police found evidence he was hiding in an upstairs closet during the attack, but the boy has not been found. A state-wide search is underway. Authorities have not ruled out the possibility that he was abducted by the assailant.""

The crime was never solved. The masked man was never found. The little boy was never seen again.

I sat back in my chair, the library basement suddenly feeling like a tomb. The static. The whispers. The closet. The man in the mask. It wasn't a prank. It wasn't a glitch. Was I listening to a ghost ? 

The next day at work, I felt... broken. I walked into the dispatch center like a zombie. The hum of the servers sounded like a funeral dirge. I couldn't keep it in anymore. I had to tell someone. I grabbed my supervisor and one of the oldest dispatchers, a woman who’d been there for thirty years, and I dragged them into the break room.

I laid it all out. The calls, the timing, the empty house, the microfiche article. I showed them the copy I'd printed out, the grainy picture of the house, the headline. I expected them to think I was insane. I expected them to tell me to take a leave of absence.

They didn't.

They just looked at each other. It was a look I’d never seen before, of a grim, tired resignation. My supervisor sighed, a heavy, rattling sound, and rubbed his temples. The older dispatcher, she just stared at the article, her face pale.

""So it's started again,"" she said, her voice barely a whisper.

""What do you mean, 'started again'?"" I asked, my voice shaking. ""What is going on?""

My supervisor sat down heavily. ""Kid,"" he said, and he looked a hundred years old. ""We need to tell you about the man you replaced.""

He told me the story. The dispatcher who had my seat before me. He'd been a good man, sharp, dedicated. About a year before I was hired, he started getting strange. He was obsessed with a specific address. The old house at the end of the road. He kept sending cars out there, insisting there was a child in trouble. The patrols always came back empty. He started pulling old files, spending his days off at the library. He became withdrawn, paranoid. He claimed he was getting calls no one else could hear.

""We checked the logs,"" my supervisor said, his voice low and serious. ""The system never registered the calls he said he was taking. We pulled the audio recorders for his console. There was nothing on them but dead air. We thought he was having a breakdown. Stress of the job.""

My blood turned to ice water. ""The system... it doesn't log the calls for me, either. They just... show up on the screen and then disappear. They don't go into the call history.""

The older dispatcher nodded slowly. ""We know. It’s the same. He told us what the calls were about. A little boy. A man in a mask.""

I felt like I was going to be sick. ""What happened to him?"" I whispered, though I already knew the answer.

""One night,"" the supervisor continued, his eyes fixed on the linoleum floor, ""he took a call. We saw him on the console, talking, his face ashen. He was typing a report, then he just stopped. He stood up, grabbed his jacket and his keys, and walked out without a word. The call was still active on his screen, but none of us could hear anything on it. We just saw the open line.""

""Where did he go?""

""He drove out to the house. His car was found parked on the road the next morning. Engine was cold. Doors were locked. He was gone.""

The silence in the room was absolute.

""We searched,"" the old dispatcher said, her voice cracking. ""The police did a grid search of the entire woods. Dogs, helicopters, the whole nine yards. They went through that house from the attic to the cellar. They found nothing. No sign of a struggle. No footprints. No him. He just... vanished. Wiped off the face of the earth.""

I stared at them, my mind struggling to process what they were telling me.

""Why... why didn't you warn me?"" I stammered.

""How could we?"" my supervisor shot back, his voice rising with a frustration that had clearly been festering for years. ""Hey, new guy, welcome aboard. By the way, this console might be haunted, and the last guy who sat here disappeared. Don't worry about it.' You'd have thought we were crazy. We thought *he* was crazy. Until you came in here today with that same damn story.""

He leaned forward, his eyes locking onto mine. ""This is what you're going to do. The next time that line rings, you do not answer it. If you answer it by mistake, you hang up immediately. You do not talk to him. You do not engage. You terminate the call and you clear the line. That's an order. Do you understand me?""

For the next few weeks, I was a ghost myself. I did my job on autopilot. Every sound, every flicker on the screen made me jump. I dreaded Tuesday nights. I drank so much coffee I could feel my heart rattling in my chest, just to stay sharp, to stay vigilant. I thought about quitting. I thought about just walking out and never coming back. But where would I go? 

Then, last night, it happened.

It was 2:45 a.m. I was staring at the clock, my knuckles white from gripping the edge of my desk. The minutes ticked by like hours. 2:46. My mouth was dry. My heart was a drum solo in my ears. 2:47.

The line lit up.

The unregistered VOIP.

It felt like a physical blow. I flinched back in my chair. My training, my instincts, every fiber of my being screamed at me to answer it. There was a child in trouble. That was the job.

But I remembered the pale, haunted face of my supervisor. The story of the man who had vanished.

*You terminate the call.*

I let it ring. Once. Twice. The flashing light on the console seemed to sear my retinas. My hand hovered over the button, trembling. I couldn't just ignore it. I had to answer. I had to.

I clicked the button.

""911, what is your—""

The static was a roar, louder than it had ever been. It was a physical presence in my ear, a wall of noise. And through it, the boy's voice came, not whispering this time, but screaming. It was a raw, ragged sound of pure agony and terror.

""HE'S GOT ME! HE'S GOT ME, PLEASE! HE'S TAKING ME! PLEASE, SIR, DON'T LET HIM TAKE ME! HELP ME!""

The sound ripped through my professional detachment and tore right into my soul. This was it. The climax. The moment the boy was taken, replaying for all eternity. My hand flew to the keyboard to dispatch a car, a purely reflexive action born of years of training.

But I stopped. My fingers froze over the keys.

*He's gone. This already happened. It's not real.*

The boy was sobbing now, his screams turning into choked, gasping pleas. ""Please... you promised... you said you'd send help... don't leave me...""

I felt tears welling up in my eyes. I was a 911 dispatcher. My job was to send help. And I was going to sit here and listen to a child be abducted or murdered and do nothing.

""I'm sorry,"" I whispered, my voice thick. ""I'm so, so sorry.""

I reached for the 'terminate' button on my screen. My finger was a millimeter from the glass. This was it. I was choosing to save myself. I was choosing to let him go.

And then, the screaming stopped.

It wasn't a fade-out. It was an abrupt cut, as if a switch had been flipped. The roar of the static dropped to a low, sinister hum. The line was still open.

Silence.

My heart was in my throat. Did I do it? 

Then a new sound came through the headset.

It wasn't the boy.

It was a man's voice. A whisper, just as terrified as the child's had been, but older, hoarser. It was distorted by the same underwater static, the same swarm of electronic insects. It was a voice trying to push its way through an impossible distance, through time itself. And it was a voice I felt, deep in my bones, I should have recognized from an old staff photo in the hallway.

The whisper was faint, but utterly, terrifyingly clear.

""...he's here.""

I froze, my finger hovering over the screen.

The voice was ragged, desperate, broken.

""...he sees you. Through the line. He's looking right at you.""

A cold dread, so absolute and profound it felt like death itself, washed over me. I slowly, involuntarily, looked up from my console, across the darkened dispatch center, towards the plate glass windows that looked out into the night. There was nothing there but the reflection of my own terrified face in the glass, my skin pale in the glow of the monitors.

The whispering in my ear continued, a final, chilling plea from a place beyond hope.

""...please. Get me out of here.""",41,1767725973.0,nosleep,2,0.91,False

Last night, I answered.","I’ve been a 911 dispatcher for twelve years, the last seven on the graveyard shift. You think you’ve heard it all after that long. The drunks, the domestics, the panicked fumbling for words after a car crash. It all becomes a kind of white noise, a rhythm of human misery you learn to navigate without letting it touch you. You have to. It's the only way to stay sane.

My district is a sprawling, sleepy county that dies after 10 p.m. It’s mostly soccer moms and retirees. The worst we usually get on a weeknight is a noise complaint or a teenager who's had too much to drink at a bonfire. The job, for me, had become a cycle of caffeine, fluorescent lights, and the low, constant hum of computer servers. I was burned out. Deeply, existentially tired in a way sleep couldn't fix. The calls were just blips on a screen, voices to be processed, categorized, and dispatched. I was a human switchboard for other people’s worst days.

The first call came on a Tuesday, about three months ago. It was 2:47 a.m. The deadest hour of the deadest night. The line lit up on my console, but not in the usual way. It wasn't a cell call with a GPS ping, or a landline with a registered address. It was just a raw signal, designated as 'unregistered VOIP.' Not unheard of, but rare. I clicked it open.

""911, what is your emergency?""

Static. A thick, wet sound, like listening to the radio underwater. It crackled and popped, and underneath it, I could just barely make out a sound. A whisper.

""...hello? Can you hear me?""

It was a child's voice. A boy, I thought. Maybe seven or eight. He sounded like he was trying to talk without moving his lips.

""This is 911,"" I repeated, my voice a little louder, a little clearer. ""I can barely hear you. What is your emergency?""

The static swelled, almost swallowing his voice whole. ""...he's back. The man in the mask is back.""

A chill, cold and sharp, went down my spine. It was a professional chill, the one that tells you this is real. This isn't a prank.

""Okay, son. Where are you? I need an address.""

""...hurting mommy,"" the whisper came again, breaking with a sob. The static sounded like a swarm of angry insects now. ""Daddy's asleep on the floor... he won't wake up.""

""Son, I need you to tell me where you are. I can't send help if I don't know where you are."" My fingers were flying across the keyboard, trying to get a trace, but the system was kicking back errors. No location data. No subscriber info. Nothing.

""The old house,"" he whispered, his voice fading. ""At the end of the road... please...""

Then the line went dead. Not a click, not a hang-up. It just ceased to exist. One moment it was there, a line of static and terror, and the next it was just a dead channel.

Even without an address, 'the old house at the end of the road' was enough. Out on the western edge of the county, there's a long, unpaved road that just sort of peters out into the woods. And at the end of it, there's one house. A big, derelict Victorian thing that’s been empty for as long as anyone can remember. It was a local legend, the kind of place kids dared each other to spend a night in.

I dispatched a patrol car. My senior officer, a guy who's been on the force since before I was born, came back over the radio about fifteen minutes later. His voice was flat, laced with the kind of annoyance reserved for rookies and time-wasters.

""Dispatch, Car 12 here. The property is secure. No signs of forced entry. Place is boarded up tighter than a drum. There's nobody here. Hasn't been for fifty years by the looks of it.""

""10-4, Car 12,"" I said, my own voice betraying none of my confusion. ""Are you sure? The caller was a child. He said his family was being attacked.""

There was a sigh over the radio. ""Listen, the dust on the porch is an inch thick. The boards on the windows are gray and rotted. If someone's in there, they're a ghost. We're clearing the call. Tell whoever's playing games to knock it off.""

I logged it as 'unfounded' and tried to put it out of my mind. A prank. A sophisticated one, maybe, using some kind of voice changer and a VOIP spoofer. Kids these days. I was too tired to care.

A week later, at 2:47 a.m., the same line lit up.

The same static. The same terrified, whispering voice.

""...he's in the house. I can hear him walking.""

This time, I felt a knot of ice form in my stomach. ""Son, is this the same caller from last week?""

A choked sob. ""He has the mask on. The one with the scary smile. Mommy's screaming.""

Faintly, through the storm of static, I thought I could hear it. A woman's scream, high and thin and distorted, like a sound being played backwards.

""I'm sending help,"" I said, my voice tight. ""Stay on the line with me. Can you hide?""

""...in the closet,"" he whispered. ""He's coming up the stairs. I can hear his feet...""

The line went dead.

I dispatched two cars this time. I told them it was a repeat call, possibly a hostage situation. I didn't want them to be complacent. They took it seriously. They set up a perimeter. They used a bullhorn. They broke down the front door.

The result was the same. An empty house. Thick, undisturbed layers of dust on every surface. Rotted floorboards, peeling wallpaper, the smell of decay and forgotten things. No footprints. No child. No man in a mask. No sign that a human being had set foot in that house in decades.

Static. A thick, wet sound, like listening to the radio underwater. It crackled and popped, and underneath it, I could just barely make out a sound. A whisper.

""...hello? Can you hear me?""

It was a child's voice. A boy, I thought. Maybe seven or eight. He sounded like he was trying to talk without moving his lips.

""This is 911,"" I repeated, my voice a little louder, a little clearer. ""I can barely hear you. What is your emergency?""

The static swelled, almost swallowing his voice whole. ""...he's back. The man in the mask is back.""

A chill, cold and sharp, went down my spine. It was a professional chill, the one that tells you this is real. This isn't a prank.

""Okay, son. Where are you? I need an address.""

""...hurting mommy,"" the whisper came again, breaking with a sob. The static sounded like a swarm of angry insects now. ""Daddy's asleep on the floor... he won't wake up.""

""Son, I need you to tell me where you are. I can't send help if I don't know where you are."" My fingers were flying across the keyboard, trying to get a trace, but the system was kicking back errors. No location data. No subscriber info. Nothing.

""The old house,"" he whispered, his voice fading. ""At the end of the road... please...""

Then the line went dead. Not a click, not a hang-up. It just ceased to exist. One moment it was there, a line of static and terror, and the next it was just a dead channel.

Even without an address, 'the old house at the end of the road' was enough. Out on the western edge of the county, there's a long, unpaved road that just sort of peters out into the woods. And at the end of it, there's one house. A big, derelict Victorian thing that’s been empty for as long as anyone can remember. It was a local legend, the kind of place kids dared each other to spend a night in.

I dispatched a patrol car. My senior officer, a guy who's been on the force since before I was born, came back over the radio about fifteen minutes later. His voice was flat, laced with the kind of annoyance reserved for rookies and time-wasters.

""Dispatch, Car 12 here. The property is secure. No signs of forced entry. Place is boarded up tighter than a drum. There's nobody here. Hasn't been for fifty years by the looks of it.""

""10-4, Car 12,"" I said, my own voice betraying none of my confusion. ""Are you sure? The caller was a child. He said his family was being attacked.""

There was a sigh over the radio. ""Listen, the dust on the porch is an inch thick. The boards on the windows are gray and rotted. If someone's in there, they're a ghost. We're clearing the call. Tell whoever's playing games to knock it off.""

I logged it as 'unfounded' and tried to put it out of my mind. A prank. A sophisticated one, maybe, using some kind of voice changer and a VOIP spoofer. Kids these days. I was too tired to care.

A week later, at 2:47 a.m., the same line lit up.

The same static. The same terrified, whispering voice.

""...he's in the house. I can hear him walking.""

This time, I felt a knot of ice form in my stomach. ""Son, is this the same caller from last week?""

A choked sob. ""He has the mask on. The one with the scary smile. Mommy's screaming.""

Faintly, through the storm of static, I thought I could hear it. A woman's scream, high and thin and distorted, like a sound being played backwards.

""I'm sending help,"" I said, my voice tight. ""Stay on the line with me. Can you hide?""

""...in the closet,"" he whispered. ""He's coming up the stairs. I can hear his feet...""

The line went dead.

I dispatched two cars this time. I told them it was a repeat call, possibly a hostage situation. I didn't want them to be complacent. They took it seriously. They set up a perimeter. They used a bullhorn. They broke down the front door.

The result was the same. An empty house. Thick, undisturbed layers of dust on every surface. Rotted floorboards, peeling wallpaper, the smell of decay and forgotten things. No footprints. No child. No man in a mask. No sign that a human being had set foot in that house in decades.

My supervisor pulled me aside the next morning. He's a large, patient man who has the weary look of someone who's seen it all twice. He told me to drop it.

""It's a glitch,"" he said, not meeting my eye. ""Some kind of cross-chatter from another jurisdiction, or a recurring electronic echo. Don't waste county resources on it. If that call comes in again, log it and move on.""

But I couldn't. The boy's voice... it was too real. The terror in it was primal. You can't fake that. Not even the best actor in the world can fake the sound of a child who thinks his mother is being murdered in the next room.

The calls kept coming. Every Tuesday, like clockwork. 2:47 a.m. Each call was a slightly different piece of the same horrible puzzle.

""...he's hurting daddy now. There's... there's so much red...""

""...mommy stopped screaming...""

""...he's looking for me. I can hear him opening doors...""

Every time, I sent a car. Every time, the result was the same. The cops got angrier. I was ""the boy who cried wolf."" My supervisor gave me a formal warning. My colleagues started looking at me funny, whispering when I walked by. They thought I was cracking up. Maybe I was. I started losing sleep. On my nights off, I'd find myself staring at the clock, my heart pounding as 2:47 a.m. approached. The silence was somehow worse than the calls.

I became obsessed. During the day, instead of sleeping, I went to the county records office. I needed to know who owned that house. The paper trail was a mess. It had been sold and resold, owned by banks and holding companies. But I kept digging backwards, through dusty ledgers and brittle property deeds. Finally, I found it. The last family to actually live there. A deed from 1968. A nice, happy family with a mom, a dad, and two kids. A boy and a girl.

That wasn't enough. I started spending my days in the library's basement, scrolling through decades of local newspapers on a squeaky, ancient microfiche reader. The stale, papery smell of the archives filled my lungs. I was looking for anything related to the house, to that family. For weeks, I found nothing. Just property tax notices and school honor rolls.

And then I found it.

An article from a cold, late autumn day in 1975. The headline was stark: ""Local Family Slain in Apparent Home Invasion.""

My blood ran cold. I zoomed in, my hands trembling as I adjusted the focus knob. The picture was grainy, black and white. It was the house. The same steep gables, the same wide porch. Police cars were parked haphazardly on the overgrown lawn.

I read the article, my heart hammering against my ribs. A husband, a wife, and their ten-year-old daughter, found dead in their home. The cause of death was... extensive. The article was vague, using phrases like ""brutal force trauma."" The police report mentioned a possible intruder, a figure a neighbor had seen fleeing into the woods, described only as a tall man wearing some kind of pale, expressionless mask.

But the last paragraph was what made me stop breathing.

""The family's eight-year-old son,"" it read, ""remains missing. Police found evidence he was hiding in an upstairs closet during the attack, but the boy has not been found. A state-wide search is underway. Authorities have not ruled out the possibility that he was abducted by the assailant.""

The crime was never solved. The masked man was never found. The little boy was never seen again.

I sat back in my chair, the library basement suddenly feeling like a tomb. The static. The whispers. The closet. The man in the mask. It wasn't a prank. It wasn't a glitch. Was I listening to a ghost ? 

The next day at work, I felt... broken. I walked into the dispatch center like a zombie. The hum of the servers sounded like a funeral dirge. I couldn't keep it in anymore. I had to tell someone. I grabbed my supervisor and one of the oldest dispatchers, a woman who’d been there for thirty years, and I dragged them into the break room.

I laid it all out. The calls, the timing, the empty house, the microfiche article. I showed them the copy I'd printed out, the grainy picture of the house, the headline. I expected them to think I was insane. I expected them to tell me to take a leave of absence.

They didn't.

They just looked at each other. It was a look I’d never seen before, of a grim, tired resignation. My supervisor sighed, a heavy, rattling sound, and rubbed his temples. The older dispatcher, she just stared at the article, her face pale.

""So it's started again,"" she said, her voice barely a whisper.

""What do you mean, 'started again'?"" I asked, my voice shaking. ""What is going on?""

My supervisor sat down heavily. ""Kid,"" he said, and he looked a hundred years old. ""We need to tell you about the man you replaced.""

He told me the story. The dispatcher who had my seat before me. He'd been a good man, sharp, dedicated. About a year before I was hired, he started getting strange. He was obsessed with a specific address. The old house at the end of the road. He kept sending cars out there, insisting there was a child in trouble. The patrols always came back empty. He started pulling old files, spending his days off at the library. He became withdrawn, paranoid. He claimed he was getting calls no one else could hear.

""We checked the logs,"" my supervisor said, his voice low and serious. ""The system never registered the calls he said he was taking. We pulled the audio recorders for his console. There was nothing on them but dead air. We thought he was having a breakdown. Stress of the job.""

My blood turned to ice water. ""The system... it doesn't log the calls for me, either. They just... show up on the screen and then disappear. They don't go into the call history.""

The older dispatcher nodded slowly. ""We know. It’s the same. He told us what the calls were about. A little boy. A man in a mask.""

I felt like I was going to be sick. ""What happened to him?"" I whispered, though I already knew the answer.

""One night,"" the supervisor continued, his eyes fixed on the linoleum floor, ""he took a call. We saw him on the console, talking, his face ashen. He was typing a report, then he just stopped. He stood up, grabbed his jacket and his keys, and walked out without a word. The call was still active on his screen, but none of us could hear anything on it. We just saw the open line.""

""Where did he go?""

""He drove out to the house. His car was found parked on the road the next morning. Engine was cold. Doors were locked. He was gone.""

The silence in the room was absolute.

""We searched,"" the old dispatcher said, her voice cracking. ""The police did a grid search of the entire woods. Dogs, helicopters, the whole nine yards. They went through that house from the attic to the cellar. They found nothing. No sign of a struggle. No footprints. No him. He just... vanished. Wiped off the face of the earth.""

I stared at them, my mind struggling to process what they were telling me.

""Why... why didn't you warn me?"" I stammered.

""How could we?"" my supervisor shot back, his voice rising with a frustration that had clearly been festering for years. ""Hey, new guy, welcome aboard. By the way, this console might be haunted, and the last guy who sat here disappeared. Don't worry about it.' You'd have thought we were crazy. We thought *he* was crazy. Until you came in here today with that same damn story.""

He leaned forward, his eyes locking onto mine. ""This is what you're going to do. The next time that line rings, you do not answer it. If you answer it by mistake, you hang up immediately. You do not talk to him. You do not engage. You terminate the call and you clear the line. That's an order. Do you understand me?""

For the next few weeks, I was a ghost myself. I did my job on autopilot. Every sound, every flicker on the screen made me jump. I dreaded Tuesday nights. I drank so much coffee I could feel my heart rattling in my chest, just to stay sharp, to stay vigilant. I thought about quitting. I thought about just walking out and never coming back. But where would I go? 

Then, last night, it happened.

It was 2:45 a.m. I was staring at the clock, my knuckles white from gripping the edge of my desk. The minutes ticked by like hours. 2:46. My mouth was dry. My heart was a drum solo in my ears. 2:47.

The line lit up.

The unregistered VOIP.

It felt like a physical blow. I flinched back in my chair. My training, my instincts, every fiber of my being screamed at me to answer it. There was a child in trouble. That was the job.

But I remembered the pale, haunted face of my supervisor. The story of the man who had vanished.

*You terminate the call.*

I let it ring. Once. Twice. The flashing light on the console seemed to sear my retinas. My hand hovered over the button, trembling. I couldn't just ignore it. I had to answer. I had to.

I clicked the button.

""911, what is your—""

The static was a roar, louder than it had ever been. It was a physical presence in my ear, a wall of noise. And through it, the boy's voice came, not whispering this time, but screaming. It was a raw, ragged sound of pure agony and terror.

""HE'S GOT ME! HE'S GOT ME, PLEASE! HE'S TAKING ME! PLEASE, SIR, DON'T LET HIM TAKE ME! HELP ME!""

The sound ripped through my professional detachment and tore right into my soul. This was it. The climax. The moment the boy was taken, replaying for all eternity. My hand flew to the keyboard to dispatch a car, a purely reflexive action born of years of training.

But I stopped. My fingers froze over the keys.

*He's gone. This already happened. It's not real.*

The boy was sobbing now, his screams turning into choked, gasping pleas. ""Please... you promised... you said you'd send help... don't leave me...""

I felt tears welling up in my eyes. I was a 911 dispatcher. My job was to send help. And I was going to sit here and listen to a child be abducted or murdered and do nothing.

""I'm sorry,"" I whispered, my voice thick. ""I'm so, so sorry.""

I reached for the 'terminate' button on my screen. My finger was a millimeter from the glass. This was it. I was choosing to save myself. I was choosing to let him go.

And then, the screaming stopped.

It wasn't a fade-out. It was an abrupt cut, as if a switch had been flipped. The roar of the static dropped to a low, sinister hum. The line was still open.

Silence.

My heart was in my throat. Did I do it? 

Then a new sound came through the headset.

It wasn't the boy.

It was a man's voice. A whisper, just as terrified as the child's had been, but older, hoarser. It was distorted by the same underwater static, the same swarm of electronic insects. It was a voice trying to push its way through an impossible distance, through time itself. And it was a voice I felt, deep in my bones, I should have recognized from an old staff photo in the hallway.

The whisper was faint, but utterly, terrifyingly clear.

""...he's here.""

I froze, my finger hovering over the screen.

The voice was ragged, desperate, broken.

""...he sees you. Through the line. He's looking right at you.""

A cold dread, so absolute and profound it felt like death itself, washed over me. I slowly, involuntarily, looked up from my console, across the darkened dispatch center, towards the plate glass windows that looked out into the night. There was nothing there but the reflection of my own terrified face in the glass, my skin pale in the glow of the monitors.

The whispering in my ear continued, a final, chilling plea from a place beyond hope.

""...please. Get me out of here.""",2,1767725938.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

1q5rg0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1q5rg0t/my_teacher_helped_me_through_depression_and/,My teacher helped me through depression and things got weird. I need objective opinions.,"When I (F25 now) was about 12 or 13 yo, I was struggling with depression and anxiety. I had life ending thougth and was self-harming. I was diagnosed at 14/15 years old and I was put on medication for a few years. My parents didn’t know what I was going through. They blamed puberty and hormones. I want to make it clear that I hold no grudges against them. Our family relationships has healed a lot since then.

The first person who truly noticed and reached out was my female teacher. I think she was freshly out of school at that time, she was young and very kind, and we became close. She shared parts of her life with me, and I shared mine with her. We even met a few times after I left school for a coffee and quick chat and we still send each other happy birthay and happy new year messages. It was always a healthy, supportive friendship she was like a mother figure to me than anything else.

There was also a male teacher at the school, in his late twenties, very much charismatic. He was the kind of teacher every girl had a crush on and he was aware of that. He was friends with the female teacher, so I knew he was aware that I wasn’t alone and had some help.

One day, after I got a lower grade in his class, he asked me to stay in the class with him. He noticed I seemed distant and sad, and told me I could always reach out to him. I started emailing him as well, and we spent a lot of time talking, both in person (he would invite me to his office after school or during breaks to chat) and by message.

Here is when things started to get weird and complicatef.

We would hug before and after our chats. These hugs were long and close, with him holding me tightly resting his chin on my head and me resting my head on his chest. I vividly remember hearing his heartbeat pounding fast during these hugs. It wasn’t a simple pat on the back or quick friendly hugs, it was very intimate. He would call it “bear hugs”.

He also invited me to his apartment (he lived in the school building and everybody knew that) to chat and also make a kind of pact with him, where we each wrote promises about staying positive and, most importantly, that I would never hurt myself again. We both signed it.

He also gave me his private phone number, and we often texted in the evenings. He shared personal details about his life. He talked to me about why he is single, what he is looking for in a woman etc.

He also gave me birthday and christmas gifts.

I quickly developed strong feelings for him, feelings I didn’t fully understand at the time. I never told him directly, but I’m sure he noticed. I would blush around him, and I even gave him a book of poems I wrote about love. I even imagined a future with him, even though logically I knew it was not going to happen. He either didn’t see it or he chose to ignore it and let it happen for a long time.

He invited me to a barbecue at his home, but I declined because it felt weird even to me.

After I left the school, I still had feelings for him, but I wanted to move on. I sent him an email explaining everything. He replied that he had noticed my feelings and was pulling away after I left the school. We said “I love you” in a friendly way and haven’t spoken since.

We both have spouses and kids now. I bump into him from time to time as he lives in the same city as my parents but we almost never exchange more that “hi”. But lately, I’ve been thinking back on this whole experience, questioning how it affected me and wondering if I’m maxbe overthinking it.

I’m sharing this because I want honest, objective opinions. Was this relationship appropriate? Am I justified in feeling unsettled? Or am I reading too much into it?

1q5rezw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q5rezw/disappointed_in_my_proposal/,Disappointed in my proposal,"Throwaway account just in case anyone here knows me. 

26F in relationship with 29M for four years. My boyfriend proposed about a week ago and I can't help but feel disappointed. We were on vacation with my family in the country I lived as a child, his first time visiting. The idea was to make it special in my favorite place that I was getting to show him for the first time. Everyone (including me) knew he was planning on proposing on the trip. We'd talked about it extensively. The vacation was already a bit of a cluster; my parents and sisters wouldn't stop arguing and he stepped in to defend me at one point when I finally lost it because of the bickering and my sister told him that he wasn't part of the family, so he should shut up. Obviously that was hurtful to both of us and we talked it over. 

My one request was that it be at least semi-private. At one point, he asked me if he should come up with a ""5 minute speech"" and I told him he didn't need to do that, but I would like him to say something thoughtful (I in fact brought up my uncle proposing to my aunt, where he didn't say anything and just slid a ring box across the table to her, and specifically said I wanted something in between total silence and a 5 minute speech.) What actually happened was us going to a coffee shop, him saying ""I know your sister says I'm not part of this family, but I want to start a family with you"" and holding out the ring. 

I think he knew it didn't go as well as I wanted because later that day he told me he felt like he was ""terrible at proposing."" To be clear--I would be happy if he proposed in our kitchen while we were cooking a roast chicken or something. It's not about any of the material things. Lowkey is what I wanted! What I wanted and didn't get is a thoughtful, sincere statement of why he wants to marry me and I feel like he thinks I'm not ""good enough"" for that, or that it just wasn't worth putting in the effort. 

I did bring it up that night when we were laying in bed, and he did give me a heartfelt speech then - but I still can't help but feel hurt and disappointed. It's painful for people to ask me about the ""story of how we got engaged."" I plan on only getting engaged and married once, so I guess I just wanted that moment to be special and it wasn't. 

The ring I wanted is still in production so he proposed with a fake ring (again, of my choosing--not the problem) so I'm wondering if I should try to hint for a ""do-over"" when the real ring gets here, or if I'm being selfish. I'm just really struggling to feel excited about the engagement at this point.

So. AITAH?

Edit: seems like lots of people aren't actually reading this the whole way through before commenting. A lot of information was provided for context. As said explicitly above, I'm disappointed because he said one sentence that was half a jab at my sister and didn't articulate anything about why he wanted to marry me. That's literally it.

1q5rdh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1q5rdh9/conflicting_with_myself_and_life/,Conflicting with myself and life,"This is the first time I'm saying this out loud because I have no one to share my feelings with and no one will understand me.

I've been living with panic attacks for about 10 years, although I've learned to live with them and now, thank God, they're rare. But over the past year, I've been having episodes like depression every now and then, when everything is bad and this time I'm having them again, they're so bad that today I was eating lunch and thinking that everything, I can't do this anymore. I can't bear it all alone. I hope the text will be coherent, because my head is such a mess with everything that I don't even know where to start.

I'm a man, 28 years old. I have a wife 2 years younger than me (we've been married for 7 years) and two children, a son 6 years old and a daughter 2 years old. I have a bachelor's degree, I'm currently studying for a master's degree, I have a successful career, but I can't do anything at work (although I really liked my job), I don't see any point in anything at all and I just want to say fuck it and that's it. But this is not about work, at least it seems to me, I don't know, I'm confused.

I am a person who literally carries my wife in my arms (when I say this, people think I'm crazy, but when I hear how others behave, cheat, etc., I understand that it really is). I bring my wife everything she wants - coffee, food,
delicious things.. I do everything just so that she feels good, because then I feel good too, if everything is fine with her. But she has some problems all the time, then this is not good, then that is not good, this crisis, then that crisis, I can't cope with her crises anymore. And all of this, of course, is also reflected in my sexual life, but I am faithful and loyal. Even in my sexual life, it is more important for me to satisfy my wife than myself. For me, sex is about enjoying the other person. Sometimes I think, why does it bother me? Why do I have to be faithful? Why can't I be like others and just say fuck it and also satisfy my desires by finding a lover? WHY DO I HAVE A CONSCIENCE????

So, I am not satisfied because I don't feel completely loved, but I can't say it out loud so as not to cause unnecessary drama. I want to feel wanted, sometimes to be pampered, to be taken care of sometimes, I'm tired of always being nice and good, I can't do it anymore... But I can't talk about it, because there are always excuses, I've tried enough to talk about it, I don't want any more unnecessary drama. It seemed like I, as a man, should be able to just swallow my emotions, and I do it BECAUSE I HAVE NO ONE TO TALK TO.

I want to love, I want to feel loved, fuck, this will sound selfish, but I know that I can make a woman happy, because I care about everything that happens in the life of my beloved woman and I will do everything to make my beloved woman feel good. That's who I am, I'm full of love, but I want to get the same in return and without pressure, so that it feels natural, maybe that's too much to ask for? I don't know. I don't even argue with my wife anymore and when she's mad at me for anything, I'd rather swallow the anger and my thoughts not start an argument because I know it'll end with us not talking for 3 days and in the end I'll apologize without even knowing what it was about and during those 3 days I'll think about how I was to blame for the situation because she's never admitted her guilt, so I don't understand. I literally dedicate my whole life to her, but there are still problems, how? I give her everything she wants, but there will always be something that's not right.

And all this is reflected in the children. I'm constantly angry (I would never raise a hand against my children in my life, I love them very much) and my heart hurts so much because I'm angry all the time. Even my son once told my wife that he wants a different dad because his dad is always angry. My heart broke at that moment, but I couldn't control this anger, I literally couldn't... I used to be able to, but not anymore.. As a result, I don't give my children everything I could (presence, love), but anger and I don't understand why this is the case and that's why I believe that I'm the worst father I could be and that's why I feel that my children would have a happier life without me than with me. And it hurts me very, very much to write this, but that's how I feel.

I feel completely empty, I feel as if my body physically exists, but I don't. Sometimes I catch myself thinking about what I'm going to write in my last letter. I can't speak anymore, I don't have the strength for anything anymore, I feel like I've done everything I had to do in this world and I don't know how I can live on. I am afraid of this thought, but I don't know what to do. I am in conflict with myself. I have fallen into such a hole that I can't see a way out anymore. I can't do this anymore. There is a lot of ""I"" in this text, because I am finally saying how I feel.

On top of everything, I have financial difficulties, because my wife, if she works, spends her money on some of her own things and I still give her money. I support her in everything. I pay the mortgage, bills, food, everything for the children.. in the last few months I have also spent my savings, I can no longer afford to do anything financially. I am at a loss.

I would also like to thank all the people who have believed in me and helped me, I want to sort out the inheritance issues so that everything goes to my children as an apology for my absence and anger, so that life will be easier for them.

I made an appointment with my family doctor today with the idea of ​​seeking help, but today at lunch I thought with tears in my eyes that I probably also just want to say thank you to her, because during these years, she has been the only person I have been able to trust and tell how I feel.

So far, the only thing that has stopped me is that God considers it a sin, but I read that nowadays God also forgives such choices, taking into account the human condition. I don't know. I would like to love, live, be wanted and happy, but if I were to get divorced, I wouldn't be able to live as well because I wouldn't be able to accept that I don't live with my children. That's why there is no way out and there is no way to part ways.

I think I'm a burden to the world, I can't do this anymore.

I hope this all makes sense. I translated the text from my own language to ENG with google translate. I am proficient in ENG, but its easier to write about my feelings in my native language.

If anyone gets this far, thank you for your attention.",2,1767725711.0,depression,2,1.0,False

We hit it off well on the app with everyday texting for a week. I then asked her out for coffee date and she said let’s do it. She offered the window where she was free. We agreed for Saturday. She later texted that she completely forgot about a previous commitment so asked if Sunday worked instead? I said sure!

For some reason her dating profile got banned on friday, so i took my shot and reached her out on instagram (obviously telling her the same). We then started texting on instagram and confirmed the first date as well.

Sunday: The first coffee date went well (we chatted for about 3 hours) and she said it was nice of me to reach out on instagram acknowledging this wouldn’t have happened if i did not. We both kinda agreed to do this again!

Monday morning: I get a text from her saying yesterday was nice, let’s plan to meet again sometime. I said i had a good time too and maybe let’s do japanese restaurant next time. On Monday I noticed she got her dating profile back online

Now after that the energy completely dropped as i got no response after that so next day i asked her out for a second date for the coming weekend. She said she would confirm by friday as she had to go for a meteor shower and she will go to bed very late and said it’s been a busy week. We were texting once or twice a day

On the day of the date, she said she’s tired and cannot make it. No alternative. 3 days go by so i text to see how’s she doing and she was responding well and with enthusiasm and said she was feeling homesick. She then went on a 10-day trip to meet her college friends but we kept texting (at a slow pace though)

Few days ago she updated her dating profile (which is cool i get it), i asked her out again this week and she said she can’t make it because she has caught flu from her trip and doesn’t wanna spread it. No alternative this time too.

I also sent a sunset picture with new year text but she didn’t wish new year also lol just responded it’s a beautiful picture. She has a public instagram profile and this weekend my friend could see her posting stories of her being out but i was restricted as i could not see any stories.

Should i just unfollow, move on and save the mental energy? Or just wait it out…(building connection over instagram chats is very difficult for me)",6,1767725662.0,AmIOverreacting,22,0.87,False

1q5r8t0,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1q5r8t0/review_bay_of_many_coves_nz/,"Review: Bay of Many Coves, NZ","After seeing a few suggestions for BOMC, built our trip around a Xmas holiday there. The tl;dr - incredibly disappointing, can see how with improvements it could be a special place, but certainly did not have value for money and did not meet my chubby expectations on anything but cost. If you’re planning to do big outdoor activities in the day, bring additional food with you - dinner is light and lunch is not always available.

Pros:
* Staff were absolutely lovely, clearly trying their absolute best.
* Breakfast is fantastic - loved the French toast with Greek yogurt and berries. Also…the berries! Wow, they were incredible every day.
* Rooms are surprisingly quiet, didn’t have too many issues with other guests passing by our room.
* Room chips are delicious!
* Drinkable tap water
* Laundry facilities are quick and easy to use - they have washing powder
* With nice weather, the water activities were lovely. Kayaking from cove to cove for a few hours was pretty lovely! Bring sun protection.
* Hikes within property were convenient - they provide trekking poles for the guests which were very helpful. The hikes are pretty steep and pretty wild - keep an eye on your footing.
* There is sunscreen and bug spray available for guests.
* In room tea and coffee are quite good.

Cons
* Accommodations are pretty basic, outdoor furniture at the room not comfortable for sitting let alone longing.
* No screens on doors or windows - there are some biting creatures so we tried to time cooling off the room by shutting off all lights at night and opening windows for a few minutes. Bites cause welts - grab antihistamine before you go just in case.
* Regular dinner service is about 2+ hours, and the steak was extremely well done…almost hard to cut.
* Xmas dinner was a surprise (to us and at least some other guests) communal dinner. We had come for a quiet Xmas and were unprepared for socializing. For 30 people seated at the same time, they just didn’t have kitchen capacity to get done efficiently. We clocked 30-40 mins between courses, and they didn’t have full lunch available that day (charcuterie boards, no crackers or bread). The half small almost baby carrot, half small mushroom, and small slice of chicken breast as a main really did me in after 2 hours. The staff were clearly working so hard and trying their best, but we would not have come here if we knew this in advance so heads up for others who may be looking for a quieter or more relaxed Xmas.
* Lack of lounging areas - the day beds in the room are comfy but would have liked some lounging chairs away from sand flies. Suggest they consider setting up some sun chairs and a shade on the dock.
* Things are…broken. Umbrellas, window shades, paddles, room heating, lights…the location is pretty remote but would expect that from an eco lodge not a $2k usd per night lodge.
* Getting here is not easy and weather can significantly impact your ability to arrive. Helicopters are often canceled due to weather and they didn’t seem to have any suggestions if you weren’t able to rearrange your own travel to get on a scheduled water taxi. Recommend having a solid backup plan in place. We found the helicopter companies were the most capable to helping us create those backup plans (aka ended up going back to Auckland, flew to Blenheim, took a cab to Picton, and then caught a water taxi). Water taxi timing took over an hour of us so keep that in mind as well during a busier time.

Some other things, but generally this was a miss for me. Had a hard time relaxing and, for the cost of the rooms, was expecting more than what ended up functionally being an eco lodge. We also spent a lot of time rearranging our arrival and departure plans due to weather, which disrupted our other days. I was looking forward to the food, and dinners were so much worse than the breakfast it was sort of strange. Wouldn’t recommend to people generally, and certainly wouldn’t recommend folks come out of their way to get here. To be fair, it has been a really stressful year and past few weeks and we did not have anything left in our tanks. We really needed some recharge quiet time and watching my partner get more and more stressed by the noise and the kids and increasingly drunk adults and the forced socializing and the way past our sleeping time dinner was disappointing.

Don’t want to be a complete downer - if this is on your way travel wise and you don’t mind the low value for money and just ok small portion dinner, it’s a really beautiful place even in the rain. If you love a communal Xmas, this could be a big win for you. If you’re looking to be taken care of and relax in peace and fuel up after a day of adventuring, this may not be it. 

We didn’t use the spa - no availability - but heard from another guest that the massage therapist was switched to a male (who was new) without notice and she was not comfortable with a male massage therapist. Other spa options were not available as the new therapist was in training. Would expect resorts in this category to give notice of these sorts of changes.",4,1767725431.0,chubbytravel,0,0.84,False

We had a messy breakup back in September (I’m anxious attachment, classic avoidant/anxious trap) to which she blamed me for being too needy. Went to therapy, pretty much worked through some problems and realized I wasn’t being that needy, that I just had needs that weren’t being met because she was avoidant.

But as the title said, we didn’t talk for a few months. I did reach out a couple times to no response, but then during the holidays mentioned above she reached out saying she wants to talk, then pull away. Then finally we did have a back and fourth close to Christmas that seemed meaningful, which also right after Christmas she drunk texted me she missed me (lol) which I was calm and said I miss her too and to enjoy her night.

When she was sober she said she wanted to grab some coffee and catch up after the new year, which I said yes. Messaged her after new years and it’s been radio silence? Like what? I don’t understand this behavior. She does have a lot going on in her life but why would you suggest coffee and then not follow through and ghost?

Rating: 7.5/10
""Honestly a solid piece for winter. I dig the reversible feature—the fleece side looks cozy, but the nylon side in this pic looks a bit deflated and wrinkly. Might need a steam or some wear to puff it up properly. The Coyote/Brown colorway is versatile, but the zipper hardware looks a little flimsy in the photo. Good daily driver, but nothing mind-blowing.""

2. The North Face Nuptse (Black)
**Rating: 8/10**
""You can't really go wrong with a black Nuptse, it’s a staple for a reason. That said, it is the 'NPC uniform' of winter. The puffiness here looks decent, not too flat. My main gripe with these is usually the collar shape—sometimes it sits weirdly against the neck. If the down fill is good, it’s a keep, but don't expect to stand out in a crowd.""

3. Ami Paris Big Heart Sweater
**Rating: 6/10**
""Unpopular opinion maybe, but the massive Ami de Coeur logo is getting a bit played out. It screams 'I bought this for the logo.' The grey knit looks clean and the stitching on the 'A' seems tight, but I’m worried about the wool quality. These tend to pill super fast or feel itchy if the material blend is cheap. Clean look, just a bit basic.""

4. Purple Brand Denim Jacket
**Rating: 5.5/10**
""This is... a lot. The paint splatter and distress effect feels a bit forced and artificial in this lighting. It gives off strong 2016 hypebeast vibes. If you style it with plain black pants it might work, but it’s a loud piece. The fit on Purple Brand is usually tight/fitted, so if you prefer the boxy/baggy trend, you might hate how this sits.""

5. Gallery Dept. Long Sleeve Tee
Rating: 7/10**
""Clean graphic. The 'Bar Dé Music' print is one of their better, more low-key designs. The blank looks decent, maybe a bit thin? The cuffs look like they might lose elasticity quickly. It’s a cool layering piece, but for what it is (literally a cotton long sleeve), it’s nothing crazy. Good for a chill fit.""

6. Acne Studios 'Mud Wash' / Chain Print Jeans
Rating: 9/10**
""Best item in the haul, hands down. The wash and the trompe-l'œil (optical illusion) chain print are sick. It fits that grimey/grunge aesthetic perfectly. My only concern is styling—these are hard to pull off without looking like you literally rolled in dirt. If you have the right boots and cropped top/hoodie, these are fire. If not, they just look messy.""

7. Corteiz Velvet Track Jacket**
Rating: 7/10
""The velvet texture looks plush, definitely a comfy piece. Corteiz is huge right now, so the hype is there. However, black velvet is a lint magnet. You are going to be using a lint roller every time you leave the house. Also, the elastic banding at the hem looks a little loose/cheap. Good for a cozy UK drip vibe, but high maintenance.""

8. Off-White 'Out of Office' (OOO) Sneakers
Rating: 8.5/10**
""Super clean colorway. The white and grey is way more wearable than the loud colors Off-White usually does. The leather cuts look smooth and the shape is correct (chunky but not clown shoes). Just be warned, these are heavy on foot. If you plan on walking all day in these, your feet might get tired. Solid pickup.""

9. Birkenstock Boston Clogs (Taupe)
Rating: 9.5/10**
""Certified classic. You literally cannot hate on these. The suede looks buttery and the color is perfect for neutral tones. They go with sweatpants, jeans, shorts, whatever. The only downside is keeping that suede clean—one drop of coffee or rain and it's game over. Make sure you spray them with protector immediately.""

10. Purple Brand Distressed Jeans (Black)
Rating: 5/10
""Meh. Similar to the jacket, the distressing here looks kinda cheap, specifically the checkered patches peeking through. It feels very 'mall fashion.' The skinny/stacked fit is also kind of dying out in favor of baggy denim. If you're going for a rockstar look, they work, but otherwise, I’d pass on these for something with a better wash.""

11. Fear of God Essentials 1/2 Zip Pullover (Nylon)
Rating: 7/10
""This is way better than their standard cotton hoodies that everyone and their grandma wears. The nylon gives it a nice technical/sporty vibe while keeping that signature boxy FOG silhouette. My only issue with these is the material noise—you literally sound like a walking bag of chips when you move. Also, the elastic on the waist looks really aggressive; expect it to ride up constantly if you don't layer it right.""

12. 'Lucky Me I See Ghosts' Hoodie (Kids See Ghosts)**
Rating: 6.5/10
""Ah, the holy grail of 2018 hypebeasts. Honestly, this piece feels a bit dated now. The puff print on the text looks decent—it’s got that 3D texture you want—but be careful washing it because that puff *will* crack and peel eventually. The wash on the grey fabric looks okay, maybe a bit too dark compared to retail, but it's hard to tell without natural light. Cool for the nostalgia, but a bit loud for 2026.""

13. Ralph Lauren Pony Socks (3-Pack)
Rating: 8/10
""Not much to say here, they are socks. You're paying for the little horse embroidery, let's be real. They are definitely cleaner than standard Nike socks for wearing with loafers or low-top sneakers like the OOOs or Birkenstocks you posted earlier. They tend to pill after a few washes though, so enjoy the crisp white look while it lasts. Solid essential.""

14. Ralph Lauren Cable Knit Sweater (Cream)**
Rating: 8.5/10
""This is the 'Old Money' starter pack final boss. It’s a super safe, versatile piece that makes you look put-together instantly. The cable knitting gives it good texture so it doesn't look cheap. It pairs perfectly with the fatigue pants or denim from your previous haul. Just make sure it’s not too thin; some of the newer RL knits feel flimsy. If the weight is good, this is a wardrobe staple.""

I need desperate help because i have some physical symptoms that render me completely unfunctional, yet no doctor i have been sent to so far has any notion of what I am dealing with. This is a last resort. 

I'm going to give some data about myself first, then I'll state my symptoms. 

I have been diagnosed with these conditions so far in my life: Hashimoto's, lipedema, PCO-syndrome, Adhd, autism spectrum disorder. I take 100 mikrograms Euthyrox daily and am at a more or less stable 1.64 TSH. I have been taking testosterone (low dose to start, about 23mg daily) for about 2 weeks now, but my symptoms have persisted for much longer before this, varying in severity. I was hoping testosterone would better some of them, but no luck. I am overweight, as my medical issues suggest, but not yet obese and I do exercise and move as much as possible with my symptoms. I try to be at the gym 2x a week and out walking in nature 2x a week. 
I wear compression leggings for my lipedema all hours except at night.
I told my gp to make an EKG about 4 weeks ago, which according to him, was absolutely perfect. Nothing abnormal AT ALL. They said my blood pressure was elevated, but i had drank a coffee before.

My symptoms are the following: 
I am so incredibly tired all the time, with occasional brain fog and definitely loss of concentration. When I do as much as walk up a flight of stairs, my body feels like im dragging an entire house behind myself on chains. Im panting, not in the way i would when id be going on a run, but more in the way like im carrying much more weight than i usually am. MUCH more weight. I havent gained weight ever since these symptoms started a few months ago, i am the same weight, and still it feels like ive gained a 100pounds at least. Usually, this will start after ive eaten something, but its always there and it pertains throughout the entire day. I often try to combat the extreme tiredness and lack of concentration with caffeine, which works for about an hour but not more, if at all. Idk if its because of that that my heart feels like its working overtime whenever i do something- like walk up the stairs. Ill feel it beat, and when i look in the mirror ill SEE it beat, which ik is normal when ur thin or exercising, but in situations like that both doesnt apply. On top of that i always feel completely dehydrated. Not thirsty though, just dry. In fact i dont even wanna drink water, because as much water as id need to drink to feel any better just makes me sick. My bowels feel overactive, i think its still normal though, a little IBS due to the lipedema is normal ive heard and its not bothering me that much, just thought maybe if this IS connected with my digestive system i might mention it.
My shortness of breath that i mentioned above on eg. the stairs, often feels like i cant take a full breath, like its cutting me off at the throat, but i never feel like i cant ACTUALLY get enough air. It is more like a reason to pant than an emergency. 
And then i also have dizzy spells. Not spells, but they come with physical activity- lets stick to walking up the stairs; ill feel brain foggy and wobbly in the knees immediately. And the strangest thing is happening in the gym, when towards the end and at the end of the sets, ill actually feel like im fainting. I have never fainted so far, but was close last week and the lightheadedness is constantly returning, followed, again, by brain fog and immense fatigue. I have heard this can be due to wrong breathing, so ive improved my breathing, my fatigue and lightheadedness has not improved.
This speaks against all of my symptoms being high blood pressure related, which is the only abnormality ive heard from doctors that i have. Im at my wits end. Anything helps.
Because: I cant fucking work like this. Neither any, even light, physical activity works without immense fatigue, nor does work at my desk, because i cannot concentrate for shit, and by now its like i dont even exist anymore.
I keep exercising because i keep thinking ""if they say its nothing, then its nothing, i must just be out of shape"", but like in this condition there is no way im improving my shape any time soon- and it also hasnt HELPED in order to improve my shape.

I feel like the explaination could so simple as a vitamin deficiency or something, but im not a doctor and so isnt chatgpt so i cant seem to find it out. And people on reddit telling me to see my doctor arent helping, bc my doctor tells me im fine, even when he does tests. My iron was normal. Slight vitamin d deficiency, im taking supplements, but i feel like a deficiency cant make me completely unfunctional, right?. Im tired of not functioning and not getting anywhere because the only time i feel fine is when i lie in bed. 

If youre asking whether its depression, i dont know, but i dont think so. I was in the ward for depression in 2022, i know what it feels like, and my overall life situation has improved so far that i dont feel like that anymore. If i get depressed now its most likely due to not being able to do anything.

Anything is appreciated. Even when its just a redirect to a subreddit or forum where people who cant get a damn diagnosis for their issues go, id love you for that. I just really need help.

It was dumb—everyone else was being nice about it, saying they'd visit and all that—but I couldn't just smile.  
  
“You're just running away,” I told him. “Family sticks together.”  
  
He looked at me like I’d already missed the point. He said, “Sometimes you leave before you're left.”  
  
I didn't hug him goodbye. I didn't even say “take care of yourself.” I let him walk out of my mom's house with my anger hanging in the air between us.  
  
He died three weeks later. Alone. In an apartment we’d never seen, in a town we’d never visited. A neighbour found him.  
  
At the funeral, my aunt handed me a small box. “He wanted you to have this.”  
  
It was a journal. Not like a diary with daily entries. More like… notes to himself. Pages dated by month and year, spread out over the last five years. Some pages have coffee stains. One has a grocery list on the back.  
  
Most of it is about his son. They hadn't spoken in years.  
  
But it’s not angry. It’s… gentle.  
  
“March 2021 – Saw a dad playing catch with his kid today. Remembered teaching my son how to throw. His small hands couldn’t grip the ball right. I wrapped my hands around his to show him. His hands are probably bigger than mine now.”  
  
“December 2022 – Called my son today. It went to voicemail. Left a message wishing him Merry Christmas. Told him I loved him. Not sure if he’ll hear it.”  
  
“August 2023 – Drove past his old high school today. Remember watching him score his first touchdown. He looked for me in the stands. I waved. He smiled.”  
  
He always wrote good about him. Like he was preserving the best version of his son in ink, because the real one was gone.  
  
I found his son on Facebook. We hadn’t talked since we were teenagers. I told him about the journal. That his dad thought about him all the time.  
  
He was quiet for a long time. Then he said, “I don’t want it. That’s his pain. I have my own.”  
  
The journal is on my coffee table now. Sometimes I pick it up and read one entry. Sometimes I just look at his handwriting—messy, slanting to the right like he was in a hurry.  
  
The last entry is dated the week before he moved.  
  
“Told my nephew I was leaving today. He got mad. Thinks I’m abandoning everyone. Doesn’t understand that I’m just trying to spare them. Easier to be mad at me for leaving than to watch me disappear slowly in front of them.”  
  
He wasn’t starting over. He was finishing alone. And I made his last memory of me one of disappointment.  
  
Sometimes I sit in my car after work and cry. Not loud, just… tears while the radio plays. I’m crying for him. For his son. For the fact that love can be so big and so quiet that nobody hears it until it’s too late.  
  
I don’t know what to do with this journal. It feels wrong to keep it. Wrong to throw it away. Wrong to force it on someone who doesn’t want it.  
  
So it sits there. And I keep reading it. And I keep crying.  
  
Maybe that’s what he needed—someone to finally hear him. Even if it’s three weeks too late, and even if it’s in a car with the windows rolled up, while the rest of the world keeps going like nothing’s wrong.",1,1767725065.0,u_Embarrassed-Okra7597,0,1.0,False

Soo, its my boyfriend’s birthday now, and like my first boyfriend ever (and hopefully my last??)

Its been like almost two years since we were officially dating, um like, and so far the official dates we’ve gone on, have been pretty mainstream. Like i took him to my favourite restaurant, we went to red fort, and like yk, coffee, etc.

AND, HIS BIRTHDAY IS COMING UP IN LIKE A WEEK, AND I WANT TO PLAN THE BEST DATE EVER.

So, i was thinking like, on the day before, in the afternoon, i can pick him up, and we can have a spa day, like facialsss, haircuts, massage, rejuvenation and stuff, then we’d go watch dhurandhar movie ( I honestly lovethat movie, like yesssss, bloood and fighting, that is what i craveeeee) and after the movie, i was hoping that i’d take him shopping for a pair of glasses, grab something to eat, OMG MAYBE EVEN GET MATCHING SHIRTS, and then we’d go to my house, and i have those massaging recliners, so we can watch Netflix and like actually chill. 

OMG, SURPRISE: THEN I WAS THINKING, I CAN CALL HIS CLOSE FRIENDS THERE, AS A SURPRISE, then “house party”, ( and i love baking cakes, so obviously i will bake a cake for his birthday) then at midnight, i will surprise him with the cake, OMG, and i have crocheted a plushie that looks like him, WOW

Then, phir sab apne apne ghar rawaana ho jayenge.

SO, I HAVE MADE THIS PLAN, NOW I NEED INPUT FORM THE EXPERIENCED PEOPLE, IS THIS ALRIGHT? OR AM I STUPID? HOW DO I MAKE HIM FEEL SPECIAL??

Its like, its his 21st birthday, THE DAY HE BECOMES AN OFFICIAL ADULT,

And i was thinking that on the official party, on D-Day, i should give him 21 gifts, yk?

GIFTS I HAVE DECIDED RIGHT NOW:

1) I have hand painted a pair of nike air forces, to look like a zebra, like with black stripes.

2) A candle set, that smells like blueberries, strawberries and lychees 

3) A KEYCHAIN, which has like mjölnir and strombreaker

4) A Non-Stick pan

( he lives with his friends, and i’m like so shocked that they don’t even have a non stick pan???? Like how do they even cook???)

5) Recipes list. ( i loove cooking, and over the years i have collected and refined my favourite food recipes to make, so i’m giving him a copy)

6) A t shirt, but like i made it like the Pinterest wali, with lip stick kisses on it

7) jade rollers and jade gua-sha

8)silk pillowcases

9) a handkerchief with hearts and his name embroidered on it

10) A MINI FRIDGE.

What it does: Lets Claude Code (or any MCP client AI) schedule desktop notifications with natural language durations.



// AI calls set\_reminder with ""5m coffee break""

// 5 minutes later → desktop notification



The underlying CLI tool works standalone too:

$ breakrs 5m stretch

Timer set for ""stretch"" (5 minutes)



Stack:

  \- rmcp crate for the MCP server bits

  \- tokio for async

  \- Shells out to breakrs CLI (also mine, also Rust)



Honestly a pretty thin wrapper, but it fills a gap - most scheduler MCP servers use Python and need cron syntax. This is just cargo install and natural language.

1q5qyjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Datingat21st/comments/1q5qyjh/how_to_tell_if_an_extrovert_actually_likes_you/,how to tell if an extrovert actually likes you and not just being friendly,"Extroverts are confusing if you’re trying to read attraction.

They’re warm to everyone. They remember names. They ask questions. They laugh easily. So when you start wondering if they like you, it’s hard to tell whether you’re special or just part of their default friendliness.

I went down this rabbit hole after watching the same situation play out over and over. People catching feelings for extroverts, getting mixed up, then feeling dumb for even asking. Once I started looking at this through psychology and behavior instead of vibes, it got a lot clearer.

Extroverts do show interest. They just show it through shifts in attention and energy, not quiet intensity.

Here are the patterns that actually matter.

---

## they choose you over the group

Extroverts love groups. That’s their comfort zone.

So when one starts carving out one on one time with you, coffee just the two of you, walks, side conversations, that’s intentional. They’re stepping out of their natural habitat to focus on you.

That’s not casual.

---

## their energy changes around you

They’re usually high energy, but pay attention to how it changes when you’re there.

Do they get more focused? More playful? More attentive? Or sometimes calmer?

Nonverbal research shows that attraction shows up as directed energy. For extroverts, that shift is noticeable because their baseline is already high.

---

## they remember details that don’t benefit them socially

Extroverts talk to a lot of people. Remembering small details costs mental effort.

If they bring up something you mentioned weeks ago, follow up on something personal, or remember preferences without prompting, that’s selective attention. Their brain flagged you as important.

---

## they initiate, consistently

Not just replying. Starting.

Texts, memes, random check-ins, invites. Extroverts reach out a lot, but when someone likes you, the consistency increases even when they’re busy or distracted.

Convenience fades. Intention doesn’t.

---

## they drop the “on” version of themselves

This one surprises people.

Sometimes extroverts get quieter around someone they like. Not bored. Not disinterested. Just less performative.

When someone feels emotionally safe, they stop entertaining and start connecting. For extroverts, that can look like calm instead of charisma.

---

## they integrate you into their life

Inviting you to meet friends. Bringing you to places that matter to them. Including you in plans instead of keeping you separate.

Extroverts don’t do this lightly. Their world is big. Making room for you in it is a signal.

---

## they show up in practical ways

Helping you out. Supporting you when it’s inconvenient. Following through.

For many extroverts, affection shows up as action. Not big speeches. Actual presence.

---

## they react when competition shows up

Not dramatically. Just subtly.

They ask more questions. Their tone shifts. They become a little more attentive when someone else enters the picture.

Mild jealousy isn’t toxic. It’s human.

---

## they adjust to your energy

If you’re quieter, they soften. If you’re hyped, they match you.

This mirroring happens unconsciously and is one of the most reliable indicators of attraction. People sync with those they want to connect with.

---

## they open up beyond surface level

Extroverts are great at light connection. Depth takes trust.

If they talk about fears, past relationships, or things they don’t share publicly, that’s vulnerability. And vulnerability is rarely accidental.

I learned a lot of this by paying attention and filling in gaps with actual psychology. Short audio breakdowns helped when I didn’t want to read another book. I used BeFreed sometimes for that, mostly to understand social dynamics and why certain patterns kept repeating. Not for dating tricks, just to stop guessing.

---

### final thought

Extroverts aren’t hard to read once you stop comparing their behavior to introverts.

The difference between friendliness and interest is focus. Time. Consistency. Integration.

If their attention keeps returning to you, that’s usually the answer.

1q5qxb8,https://i.redd.it/v64pa6sqwrbg1.jpeg,PSA NYC Matcha lovers: make sure you get your matcha from a reputable place.,"Edit: Matcha 108



Sorry, long but skip to ""third visit"", that's the important one. (Cautionary tale I guess.)

I’m not naming the place because I’m not trying to get myself in trouble (already making a new reddit account to post this), but it’s a tea house in NYC. Not super famous, but it has a loyal crowd and people swear by the matcha.

I am all for supporting small businesses, but I *hate* when “small business” turns into an excuse to cut corners and not care about customers.

First time I went, they’d only been open for a few months. The SECOND I walked in, I got hit with the nastiest smell like wet, rotting wood. It was coming from this big communal wooden table they have. I powered through and ordered an oat matcha latte. They didn’t charge extra for oat (love that), and I won’t lie… the matcha was GOOD. Like actually good. **They told me it was from Uji** (pay attention to this, it is important), which I loved because like all of you, I drink matcha daily and Uji is my favorite. I liked it so much I made a TikTok and told people about the place.

Second visit was about 6 months later, it’s in Manhattan and I don’t live there, so it's not super easy to get to. The matcha was still good, but definitely not as good as the first time. I didn’t ask, but I feel like they changed the matcha, or the person this time didn't do it correctly. The same wooden table was there, but it didn’t smell anymore, probably because they had a STRONG incense burning. Like literal smoke in the air. Zero ventilation.

While sitting there, I started noticing things. One of my first jobs in NYC was at a coffee shop, so I know sanitation rules. You’re supposed to have a commercial sink. They don’t. They use a regular apartment sink. I used their bathroom and there was a shower in it… so I’m guessing the place used to be an old apartment that now is a commercial space. Which also means they’re using tap water to make your matcha. And yes I drink tap water all the time, NYC tap water is safe, but I’m paying $8+ for a “premium” matcha latte. At least TRY to give a premium experience?? Other places care enough to filter their water, look at 12 matcha (not a fan of their lattes tho) they care so much about your experience you can see the charcoal water and the latte is cheaper than this one I talk about.

But the THIRD visit… omg.

I went last holiday season I ordered my usual and sat there with my jacket on because it was freezing, no heat, no nothing. While waiting, I looked up at the ceiling and saw spider webs. Not one. Not two. Spider webs in almost every corner. INCLUDING near where they whisk the matcha. Like??? Do they not clean the ceiling???, and if they don't care about that, what else don't they care about? I hate spiders.

I was supposed to meet a friend there but I texted them to meet me somewhere else nearby instead. When I looked at my drink, it wasn’t as green as my last 2 times there. I tasted it and… girl. **There is NO WAY that was Uji matcha**. Either it was super low-quality Uji or it wasn’t Uji at all and they’re just saying it is. Tbh I am convinced they are using a lower grade matcha and selling it as premium. great so now I’m paying $8+ for a PREMIUM matcha latte from Uji and I'm getting some low grade stuff?

So yeah. That was my last time. They were always nice to me, and I don’t want to name names because I did make a video for them, but being nice doesn’t mean I’m okay with bad hygiene, cutting corners, or possibly lying about what they’re selling.

Anyways, people in NYC, get your matcha from reputable sources.

I now have it explained what I need help with, but still the same post that got deleted before, but I need help!! :< 



Hi, I have no experience at all in making games. I’m a complete beginner.

Now, before I continue, please no hate! (but this is Reddit…) I know there will be some negativity, but that’s fine! I’m just starting and looking for some honest help and suggestions!

Now, before you suggest classes and actually going to major in this, getting other experience, I will when I can, just know that! Right now, I’m moving out, finishing up my senior year, and I’m a rookie, I’m broke, but that doesn’t mean I’ll give up or wait any longer! (Also, for the mod team, I have looked at the rules, looked at posts of the same topics of other people needing help, etc, I still need help because I want specific things lol)

I’ve been watching YouTube videos and asking ChatGPT to help, but these can only do so much. I don’t really know what I’m looking for either! It’s helped a bit. I was able to create a title screen with a button that allows you to enter your name, which the game will remember and use in dialogue to refer to you. This is followed by a continue button that leads into the main game. That’s where I’m STUCK. I even got the multiple endings page working from the title screen, and I got music, moving background, etc. but like, there’s so many little things I don’t know yet and want to know, like how to get everything I did to move with the screen being full screened or moved around, as of right now it’s staying in one spot no matter what res it is. I watch YouTube videos and got ChatGPT to explain how to code and how everything works, but when it comes to the very small things I’m imagining, what do I do??

With this being said, any advice, suggestions, and ideas would be very helpful! Like anyone have a series on YouTube or anywhere to watch that would be worth it? Any Reddit posts? Anyone willing to help a sister out, haha! That was a joke, but I mean, I’m always welcome to a bit of help!!! But seriously, how do I start progressing more and understanding things? How did you start? Tell me everything. I also want to map out my game a bit more, and honestly, anyone willing to help listen to my ideas and tell me how I could do something better or how I can go about doing it/figuring it out would be amazing! Also, any Discord servers that have helping hands or something of the sort that could be a great resource to have?

Thank you, I appreciate you reading this. Even though it sounds stupid, I really want to do this! I’m also looking for a team, but I want to get this project started so people have a reason to support and get in on this! Feel free to pm me too.

For example, this is the type of game I’m going for (if there’s any certain advice/help I could use with more details on this type of game)

2d cosy horror

\- visual novel style

\- has gameplay

A game where you work at a midnight cafe, you have unusual customers, you have to serve them drinks not based on an order, but by them explaining their preferences and their overall attitude/appearance. The game doesn’t have levels but days, I want it to be 2d but have the camera behind the counter, but be able to move the camera left and right to the counters beside you, etc. be able to click on ingredients, select cups, ice, make the coffee, boba, tea, etc. have a screen to pull up a list of drinks you’ve made and their side effects, and other things you can pull up onto the screen, also I want this game to have multiple endings, based on how you handle customers, the drinks you give them, how you handle horror events/strange things happening to you, etc.

  
Advice is needed, but! These are things I want to work on that I need help with,

  
1. Making the screen, I understand how to make it a visual novel sort of style, but I need help with making it so that I can move the camera (from player pov) and see different counters on each side

2. I also want to know how to start with making the ingredients? Each ingredient, for example, will be like milk=cures loneliness or sugar=cures sadness. How do I implement this into, like, each ingredient can make a certain type of drink, and before that, how do I make the ingredients interactable?

3. I want to make it where you can click on a cup, click on either tea, coffee, boba, ice/no ice for warm, then the ingridents of each category, like cream, milk in a catergory, toppings, then base things, how do i make it where all of these things are on the coutner, then the player can make the drink? There can be any combination. Will I have to go ahead and think of every combination possible and then set out names for each drink? How would I go about doing that?

4. I want there to be different responses/actions from the customer when receiving a drink, certain ingredients/base(coffee, tea, boba)/ice, warm to have different reactions from the customer, and I want it to trigger different endings. I have some ideas, but any help is appreicated.

5. Now, this one is a bit easier, and I wanted a few videos on it, but making it where you are on the screen, on the sides, has popups like one to view drinks you have made, its name, and the ingredients you used for them. one for viewing your tasks, one for viewing what things you are low on, and ordering it, etc. I think i somewhat know how to make it, but if anyone knows a similar way or a different way than I know, that would be helpful!!



There are also other things I'm sort of stuck on trying to figure out, definitely, I know that I can't get all help from tutorials, asking, and AI, but help never hurts!! And I'm experimenting and learning more every day! Thank you, hopefully I made this better so that it doesn't get taken down, because I've tried looking these things up and I'm really stuck!!

  
ALSO, any help with advice on making this 2d visual novel/simulator style will also help!!!

I(24M) have been having a rough stretch since losing a close friend. My brain has been doing that fun thing where it replays everything at 2 a.m., so I figured I should do something normal-person-ish. Our apartment complex has a little flyer wall by the mailboxes, and I saw one for a neighborhood association meeting at the library. Free coffee, “all are welcome,” the whole vibe. I thought I would just sit in the back, listen, maybe feel like a functioning human.

  
I get there and it’s like twelve people in folding chairs, all very earnest. A guy(60M) at the door hands me a nametag and asks if I’m “new.” I say yes. He says “Awesome, we need fresh faces.” That should have been my cue to leave, but I sat down like a champ.

  
They start doing introductions and I, trying to be social for once, mention I like memes and I work with computers. The woman leading it(40F) lights up and goes, “Perfect, we desperately need someone to handle our Facebook and Instagram.” Everyone turns and looks at me like I just volunteered to defuse a bomb.

  
I try to backpedal with, “Oh I just meant I scroll a lot,” but my voice decided to stop working. Then they start talking content calendars. Then someone(30F) hands me a clipboard. Then they ask what my email is. Then I’m standing by the printer while they help me log into something called “NeighborhoodOfficialPageAdmin.”

  
Now I’m apparently responsible for posting meeting minutes and “keeping engagement positive.” I can barely keep myself positive, man.

The majority of my life I think I was undereating compared to what my body needs. There was a joke in my family growing up that after eating dinner, I would always be looking for snacks 1 hour later, even though I ate the same portion sizes as my dad and brother of a similar age. I was always seen as a quiet low energy teen, but I don't think this would've been the case if my body processed food like everyone else. I was always tall and skinny and couldn't gain an ounce of fat no matter what I ate. 

In college, I remember eating a typical breakfast that most people would make (a bagel, a bowl of oatmeal etc.) and still be ravenously hungry afterwards. I discovered coffee around this time which I enjoyed because it suppressed my appetite, or at least kept me mentally alert despite being hungry. I did zero exercise in college, and ate fast food for every meal and still did not gain a shred of fat. 

Anyways fast forward to my mid twenties. I started working out, and eating super clean (only whole unprocessed foods, with an emphasis on protein). I felt better than ever in terms of mood and energy, but there would be peaks and troughs throughout the day. The problem is that I felt I had to constantly be snacking on the most calorically dense foods, like cheese and nuts, and having several glasses of full fat milk in a day on top of regular meals to feel satiated. 

Basically I would like to be able to eat regular portion sizes that normal people eat, and still have sustained energy throughout the day. It's inconvenient to have to make huge breakfasts, and lunches and dinners. And even when I do consume extra food, it's as if my metabolism just speeds up and then I need to eat more, and I still have the energy dips where I start to feel weak and disoriented. 

I feel like I must not be absorbing certain types of nutrients efficiently, but any idea what it might be? I have healthy blood work, I don't have diabetes, I don't have the symptoms of thyroid issues, I have normal healthy digestion. I'm also not stressed, and don't think I'm emotionally eating.

1q5qsva,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stutter/comments/1q5qsva/advice_for_overcoming_stuttering_blocks_over/,Advice for Overcoming Stuttering Blocks Over Headset at Work,"Hi, I'm new to this community, so I apologize if this post is redundant.

About 2 years ago, when I used to work for a coffee shop, all of a sudden I developed stuttering blocks when taking orders over the headset at the drive-thru. Once this happened for the first time, it would happen any subsequent time I worked the drive-thru. This was a shame, as the job was enjoyable and laidback before the sudden development of the blocks.

At their onset, I was unable to say anything through the headset when a customer was waiting to have their order taken, no matter how hard I tried. When it was my responsibility to take orders, I would have to hand my headset over to another employee because I couldn't get a single word out. As time passed, I was eventually able to take orders through the headset if I prepared myself for it, but I still felt incredibly anxious in case I suddenly blocked.

At the time, I was unaware that these were blocks or related to stuttering, and was thoroughly confused as to why I would go from chatting perfectly fine with my co-workers to then suddenly lose the ability to speak when I had to take an order at the drive-thru. My guess is that because we had to take these orders immediately once a customer pulled up, I felt pressured immensely. Recently, I happened to come across the concept of stuttering blocks, and they seemed to resemble what I was experiencing exactly.

The problem is that now I have a few months before I go back to school, and I need to find a part-time job quickly. I wouldn't mind working a similar job at a coffee shop, as the job was easy in all other aspects, but I'm worried that these blocks may come back. Any job where I would have to talk through a headset at a drive-thru or even answer phone calls feels like they might bring back these stuttering blocks, and because it's a part of the job, I just can't not be able to speak.

Since this severely limits me now, I'd like to be able to work jobs like these without worrying about suddenly blocking. Does anybody have any similar experiences, or any advice that may help me not block if I started working a similar job. Any help would be greatly appreciated!",3,1767724484.0,Stutter,1,1.0,False

Scrolling through Instagram at 2am, obsessing over a random comment someone made about your outfit three weeks ago. Checking how many likes your post got. Again. Replaying that awkward thing you said in a meeting. Your brain's basically a 24/7 surveillance system monitoring everyone's reactions to you.

Here's what I learned after diving deep into psychology research, listening to dozens of podcasts, and reading everything from neuroscience to sociology: your brain is literally wired to care what others think. We evolved in small tribes where social rejection meant actual death. Your anxiety isn't a personal failing, it's biology doing its job. The difference is, we don't live in tribes anymore, but our brains haven't caught up.

The good news? You can rewire this. I spent months researching the psychology behind people pleasing, approval seeking, and social anxiety. What I found changed everything.

**Your brain's spotlight effect is lying to you**

Psychologist Thomas Gilovich's research proves that people think about you way less than you imagine. Like, significantly less. Everyone's too busy worrying about themselves to analyze your every move. That embarrassing thing you said? They forgot it 5 minutes later.

Try this: next time you're spiraling about what someone thinks, ask yourself ""will this matter in 5 years?"" Most of the time, it won't matter in 5 days.

**The opinion hierarchy that saved my sanity**

Not all opinions deserve equal weight. I started categorizing people into three circles:

* **Inner circle:** people who genuinely love you, know your values, want the best for you. Their feedback matters.
* **Middle circle:** acquaintances, coworkers, casual friends. Their opinions are data points, not truth.
* **Outer circle:** strangers, internet randos, that judgmental person from high school. Their opinions are literally meaningless noise.

This framework comes from Brené Brown's work on vulnerability and shame. Game changer.

**Read ""The Courage to Be Disliked"" by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga**

This book broke my brain in the best way. It's based on Adlerian psychology and completely flips how you think about social approval. The main idea? All your relationship problems stem from trying to live up to other people's expectations. The authors argue that true freedom means accepting that some people won't like you, and that's genuinely okay.

What hit me hardest: ""Someone has to start. Other people might not be cooperative, but that's not connected to you. My advice is this: You should start. With no regard to whether others are cooperative or not."" Insanely liberating read. This is hands down the best book on social freedom I've encountered.

**Your ""not giving a fuck"" muscle needs training**

Start small. Wear something slightly outside your comfort zone. Share an unpopular opinion in a group chat. Order something different at your regular coffee shop. These tiny acts of independence literally rewire your brain's threat response.

Dr. Kristin Neff's research on self compassion shows that treating yourself like you'd treat a good friend reduces social anxiety more than traditional self esteem work. When you mess up or someone judges you, talk to yourself the way you'd comfort your best friend.

**Try the Finch app for building this habit**

Finch is this gentle self care app where you take care of a little bird while building healthy habits. Sounds childish but it actually works. You can set daily goals like ""practice saying no"" or ""wear what I want."" The app sends reminders and tracks your progress without being preachy. It made habit building way less intimidating for me.

**BeFreed is an AI learning app that creates personalized podcasts from expert knowledge**

Built by Columbia grads and ex-Google engineers, it pulls from books, research papers, and expert talks to build custom audio content. You type what you want to work on, like overcoming social anxiety or building confidence, and it generates a tailored learning plan with podcast episodes.

The depth control is clutch. Start with a 10-minute overview, and if it resonates, switch to a 40-minute deep dive with real examples and strategies. The voice options are weirdly addictive too, like choosing a smoky, sarcastic narrator that makes psychology concepts way more digestible during your commute.

**The ""fuck it"" adjustment strategy**

Borrowed this from Mark Manson's work. Make a list of things you actually give a fuck about. Your top 5-7 values. For me it's creativity, close relationships, learning, health, authenticity. Everything else? Literally doesn't make the cut.

When someone's opinion triggers you, ask: does this relate to my core values? If Karen from accounting thinks my career choice is weird, and ""Karen's approval"" isn't on my list, then her opinion gets filed under ""irrelevant data.""

**Listen to ""The Mindful Kind"" podcast by Rachael Kable**

This podcast has incredible episodes on overthinking and social anxiety. Episode 285 on ""Reducing People Pleasing Tendencies"" gave me practical scripts for setting boundaries without spiraling into guilt. Rachael's voice is super calming and her advice is research backed without being academic.

**Accept that discomfort is the price of authenticity**

Here's the uncomfortable truth: you can't stop caring what people think AND have everyone like you. Pick one. The people who matter will stick around when you show up as yourself. The ones who don't? They were never your people anyway.

Dr. Susan David's research on emotional agility shows that trying to avoid discomfort makes anxiety worse. The goal isn't to never feel anxious about judgment, it's to feel it and do the thing anyway.

Some people will judge you no matter what. Might as well get judged for who you actually are rather than some exhausting performance you've been putting on.

Start practicing today. Pick one small thing you've been avoiding because of what others might think. Do it anyway. Notice that the world doesn't end. Repeat.",1,1767724359.0,focusedmen,0,1.0,False

I’ve been diving deep into store data recently, looking at the relationship between acquisition costs and retention. There is a brutal pattern emerging: most of us are obsessed with Facebook/TikTok ROAS, but we have a massive hole in our retention buckets.

CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) is skyrocketing, yet the effort to get that second purchase is usually just a generic ""Thank you"" email or a 10% coupon that nobody uses.

The issue with traditional loyalty programs (points, tiers) is that they are reactive. They wait for the customer to do something.

After looking at how big brands use predictive models, it seems the key is being proactive with data:

1. **Timing is everything:** Sending a ""buy again"" email 30 days later is useless if the product (e.g., shampoo or coffee) runs out in 45 days. Or worse, sending it at 15 days when they are still fully stocked.
2. **Behavior over spend:** A customer who visits the site 3 times post-purchase but doesn't buy needs a different trigger than someone who bought once and vanished.
3. **Prediction vs. Suggestion:** Instead of suggesting generic ""bestsellers,"" high-retention stores analyze order history to predict what the specific next logical purchase is. 

I'm trying to move away from static flows in Klaviyo towards more predictive triggers based on customer behavior.

Is anyone else shifting their focus heavily to retention right now given the ad costs? What strategies or logic are you using to trigger that second purchase without just spamming discounts?",0,1767724357.0,shopify_geeks,0,0.5,False

It occurred to me that the church had a similar problem with the temple. We often hear TBMs gush over their temple attendance, but what do they actually learn. Then it hit me. The temple is nothing more than job orientation for the corporation. The creation element is nothing new (other than the Mormon flavor) and can easily be discussed outside the temple. Outside of the Masonic history, the temple ordinances only focus on the corporation. There is nothing about serving others as Christ would. Everything is focused on the individuals adherents to anything the church asks or needs.

I wanted to share a project I’ve been working on, hoping it might help others in this community.

In 2023, my partner suffered two strokes due to an AVM (Arteriovenous Malformation), which resulted in right-side hemiparesis and aphasia. To help with her rehabilitation and neuroplasticity, I initially built her a physical mirror box. However, after researching and talking to therapists, I learned that VR (Virtual Reality) could offer a more immersive and effective experience for **Mirror Therapy**.

Being a developer, I decided to build a tool for her that is accessible to everyone.

**What is it?** It is a **VR Mirror Therapy application** that runs directly in your mobile browser. It uses your phone’s camera to ""flip"" the image of your healthy limb, tricking your brain into thinking the affected limb is moving (pain-free), which helps retrain neural pathways.

**Key Features:**

* **100% Free & Open Source:** I built this to help, not to make money.
* **No Install Needed:** It’s a web app. Just click the link and it works on iOS and Android browsers.
* **Private:** No registration, no login, and no data collection. You just open it and use it.
* **Accessible:** It works with any standard smartphone and cheap VR goggles (the $10 ones you can find on Amazon or AliExpress).
* **Global:** Translated into **50 languages**.

**How to use it:** I’ve made a short video explaining how it works here:  
👉 **Demo Video:** [https://youtu.be/JC6Q8dHTTCo](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://youtu.be/JC6Q8dHTTCo)



**Try the App:** You can access the tool here: 🔗[**https://neocodebinary.github.io/vrtherapy/**](https://neocodebinary.github.io/vrtherapy/)



**What's next?** I am currently working on native versions for the **App Store and Google Play** to reach more people (these will also be free). The project has an optional ""Buy me a coffee"" button if anyone wants to support the development, but it is completely optional. The tool is fully functional for free.

I sincerely hope this can help you or your loved ones in their recovery journey. Please let me know if you have any feedback!

""Hello everyone, my name is Elijah. Before you can grasp the full picture of my current situation, I will try to briefly describe my life.

I am 21 years old, and I am a rather depressive person. My thoughts are deep and pensive—it is very difficult to explain this properly. I have faced many trials in my life, and I’ve had to go through most of them alone. Despite my age, my mindset and interests differ greatly from those of my peers, who seem only to care about going to clubs and putting various substances into their bodies.

Let’s move on to another part of my life: relationships. I am unlucky in love. It is a sad fact that brings me nothing but pain and disappointment time and time again. At first glance, based on the phrase 'unlucky in love,' it might seem like I’m someone who lacks female attention—if only that were the case. The truth is, I’ve had many women in my life, and they have been a presence since my teenage years.

Many of those relationships ended through my own fault, and just as many because of my partners. I won’t go into the details of the past. My most recent experience was with a girl whose real name I won't mention; let’s call her Emily. She entered my life after a long period of solitude and gave me hope—hope that not everything was lost. But as it turned out, those were just empty words. Every time I start a new relationship, I become more convinced that it is all in vain, and each time, it feels worse than the last.

I am a serviceman, and when I left for duty, Emily was upset but full of ambition to wait for my return. I was incredibly happy with that outcome. Sadly, it didn't last long. After just a couple of months, she let our communication fade to nothing and cut ties completely. I was devastated and broken by her actions. For a man in a place like this, it felt like a low blow. I don’t want to blame her for it, but at the same time, it hurt me to my very core.

Days, weeks, and months went by. I grew used to it and moved past the heartache, accepting the fact that I needed to live and move forward. Without even intending to, I met a girl. After Emily, I didn’t want any interaction with women at all, but for some reason, I decided to talk to her. We exchanged contacts, and our connection began to grow. Her name is Anna. She seemed so gentle and innocent, yet a strong personality at the same time—exactly the kind of woman you’d want to build a family with and raise children. In a way, she reminded me of my cousin. Моя кузина Lexi is a wonderful young woman and a great mother to my newborn nephew; I’ve always wanted to find a woman even slightly like her. I know I said that after Emily I had no desire for a relationship, but as I continued talking to Anna, I found myself getting more and more attached. And that is exactly where the problem lies.

Anna and I have been talking for quite a while now, even though I made a terrible first impression when we met. We had agreed to go for a walk in the city I had recently moved to, where I subsequently met her. Anna gladly agreed to show me the city and have a coffee with me. The day of our meeting arrived. It so happened that our meeting was scheduled for the evening, and leading up to it, I was sitting with some colleagues. We were drinking. It seems obvious that I should have rescheduled, but I wanted to see her so badly that I didn't. By evening, I was monstrously drunk and could barely walk. Naturally, none of these factors stopped me. I left the house and headed to our meeting spot. I walked for about an hour, ignoring the cold and my intoxication. When I finally saw her, I was struck by how beautiful she was—she was practically glowing. Of course, she immediately noticed that I could barely stand on my feet.""

I fix appliances for a living around Aurora, so I’m pretty picky about stuff like door switches, turntable drive, and how evenly a unit actually heats in day to day use.

Cooking power is legit for a 1000 watt microwave oven. Coffee, leftovers, and a bowl of frozen veg all came up to temp fast, without needing to bump time a ton. Preset program options are there (popcorn, potato, fresh veggies, etc) with serving size choices, though I mostly live on Start +30 sec like most humans do. Two stage cooking is handy for stuff that needs defrost then cook, but it’s not something I’d call “must have.”

Defrost performance is better than average because you get defrost by weight or time. Weight defrost did a decent job on chicken cutlets without cooking the edges too badly, but timing still matters, and I had to flip halfway thru.

Interior capacity feels true to the 1.0 cu ft / 28L claim. Dinner plates and med casserole dishes fit fine. Stainless steel interior is a real win: it doesn’t hang onto burnt popcorn odor, and wipe-down is easier than painted interiors. Ease of cleaning is helped by the flat touchpad controls too, no crumb catching buttons.

Rotating plate functionality has been smooth so far on the 12 inch glass tray, though one long term review mentioned a turntable motor eventually quitting after years, which tracks with what I see in repairs. Heating evenness is decent with the turntable running; edges can still run hot on dense foods, normal microwave stuff.

Noise level is on the lower, less annoying side, but the door has a kinda tinny sound when closing. Build quality overall feels solid for the mid priced range, yet the door and handle operation includes a safety feel you notice at first. Display readability is fine from across the counter, basic LCD, not fancy.

Energy consumption is typical 1000W class, nothing magic for efficiency. Aesthetic design is brushed chrome and stainless, clean looking, not trendly. Durability and longevity seem plausable given people getting a decade plus out of it, though I did see one report of it turning on by itself once, and yeah, that would make me nervous enough to unplug it and watch it for a bit. Price wise, it sits above the cheapest big box microwaves, but below the premium “smart” units, and you’re mostly paying for the stainless interior and a more serviceable, no nonsense build.",1,1767723945.0,KitchenStack,0,1.0,False

1q5qhti,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAustria/comments/1q5qhti/i_can_move_to_austria_or_germany_anything_im_not/,I can move to Austria or Germany... anything I'm not considering?,"SO SORRY for the giant wall of info, I know from combing through these subs that a lot of time the answer to these types of questions are very situation-dependent, so I wanted to offer up what I think may be relevant 😬.

I am a first generation German American with duel citizenship. I've been living in Portugal for the past 3 years but my company also has offices in Germany and Austria, and I recently found out that I can easily transfer to either one. I have visited both countries, feel very ""at home"" culturally in both, still speak German at an A2 level despite not having taken German classes since high school (but I'm currently taking private lessons twice a week, watching German TV, listening to German podcasts, etc, to increase my fluency).  I'm doing some scouting trips to both countries staring next month,  but would love some perspectives on living on Germany as a citizen vs in Austria as an EU Citizen/Resident, as well as if my research so far seems accurate?



About me: Mid 40s, childfree, boyfriend is a Portuguese citizen. I'm politically very progressive,  have fantasy colored hair, facial piercings, and have a lot of tattoos.  I have two (lazy) well-behaved dogs (small min pin mix and large greyhound). I work for an international software company with offices in multiple countries, and my salary will be adjusted accordingly when I move. I work in a niche, senior level role that's fairly high demand and have a decade of experience in another niche area, so I have good job security overall (as much as anyone can these days, anyway).  I will get private healthcare provided through my company and am healthy, active, and have no mobility issues. I'm not gonna be rich by any means, but my salary will be aligned with industry standard wherever I decide to live. 



I don't have a car and don't want one - public transit, walking, biking are all high priority for me.  I prefer cold and overcast weather (I'm a polar bear), mild/short summers that aren't overly humid (I'd rather have hot and dry than warm and humid).  I love weird, quirky museums (like the Funeral Museum and Museum of Reproductive Care in Vienna!), natural history museums, watching rugby, enjoying green spaces, swimming (pool and freshwater) skating (I played roller derby on and off for over a decade in the states). I like a nice wine bar, cocktail lounge, or coffee shop, not really into nightclubs/regular bars.



I prefer living in smaller cities or on the outskirts of larger cities, as long as I have all of the things I need for daily life (grocery store, pharmacy, gym, etc), good transit, walkable/bikeable streets,  and access to green space nearby. My ultimate goal would be to eventually buy a townhome, duplex, or small house with a garden.



I already have a good friend in Austria who offered to meet up and help me with apartment hunting and any translation help I may need. I'm looking at Vienna (suburbs/outer districts), Linz, and Gratz.  I've been to Vienna twice (Loved the museums, bike paths, general cleanliness, and abundance of transit). I also really enjoyed swimming in the local lake in my friend's village, so I wouldn't be mad at a clean nearby body of water I can jump in in the summer.  I've heard from my friend, former tour guide, and current German teacher (who's Austrian) that Austria has fewer jobs, slightly lower salaries, and higher taxes, but that you get more for your tax money as far as public healthcare and on-time transit. They said Austrians also report being happier and Vienna being a top city for livability. 



In Germany I am planning to check out Bremen, Leipzig, and maybe some Hamburg suburbs? I have a former teammate in Munich who I could ask for advice, and I could tap some fluent family members for translation help if I need it, but I haven't seen much of Germany - I went there as a kid a few times and spent 2 days in Munich on a tour. The impression I've gotten from Reddit subs is that Germany has more tech job prospects and higher salaries if I need to find a different job at some point, is a bit more accepting of Ausländer, and has lower taxes. 



I have a relocation fund and will also have the proceeds from my apartment sale in Portugal when I decide where I want to go.  I have a tax professional and a lawyer already that can help with tax stuff.  My plan is to do some scouting trips, get a short term place while I look for a place to rent for a year or two, and then hopefully buy something small once I figure out exactly where I want to settle. 



I also plan to get involved with the local roller derby league (all of these cities have one from what I can see... ) and join other interest based activities so that I can meet people and have the maximum German language immersion. 



So my main questions for locals and/or people that have lived in both are: 

\-> Is one country better than the other based on what I'm looking for?

\-> Are there other cities I should check out?

\-> Would having citizenship in Germany be enough of a benefit to choose it over Austria?

\-> Am I forgetting any important factors?",1,1767723830.0,AskAustria,49,0.53,False

There are scheduler MCP servers out there (like scheduler-mcp), but they use cron syntax. I wanted something simpler, more ergonomic.



So I built rmcp-breakrs - a Rust MCP server that wraps my CLI timer tool. Natural language, no cron expressions:



""5m get coffee""

""1h 30m meeting reminder""

""30s tea is ready""



Claude can now:

\- Set reminders with plain English durations

\- List pending timers

\- Cancel specific reminders

\- Set recurring notifications



The twist: The underlying tool (https://github.com/sqrew/breakrs) works great standalone. Don't want AI involved? Just use it directly:



$ breakrs 5m stretch break

Timer set for ""stretch break"" (5 minutes)



So whether you want AI-powered reminders or just a dead simple CLI timer, you're covered.



Install:

cargo install breakrs        # standalone CLI timer

cargo install rmcp-breakrs   # MCP server for Claude Code

Looking for honest feedback","I’ve been doing intermittent fasting for a while and I’m honestly confused about why I’m not losing weight, so I’m hoping for some outside eyes on my routine.

**Current IF setup**

* Schedule: 16:8
* Fasting window: \~9pm–1pm
* Eating window: 1pm–9pm
* Meal timing:
   * 1pm – lunch
   * 4–5pm – protein bar
   * 7:30pm – dinner

**What I usually eat (typical day)**

* Lunch (1pm): avocado and tuna sandwich with some fruits
* Snack (4–5pm): protein bar
* Dinner (7:30pm): chicken breast, veggies, and lentils

I don’t snack outside of that, and I drink water and black coffee only.

**Activity / exercise**

* Mostly sedentary outside the gym (desk / low activity day).
* I work out 5–6 days per week at the gym, switching between cardio days and weight lifting days.

**History with IF**

* I’ve been back on 16:8 consistently for about 4 months now.
* Before this, I did IF for about 2 years straight as well.
* Despite all that time, my weight basically hasn’t moved in any meaningful way.

**Tracking / medical context**

* I don’t track calories (I’ve only ever had rough estimates suggested to me; I’ve never logged seriously).
* Meds: I’m on antidepressants and cholesterol medication, which I know *can* sometimes affect weight, but I’m not sure how much that explains things.

**How it feels**  
It’s frustrating because on paper it feels like I’m “doing the right things” – fasting, eating what seems like reasonable meals, and working out most days – but I’m not seeing results on the scale. It’s starting to mess with my head a bit and I’d rather know what I’m missing than keep spinning my wheels.

**What I’m asking you all**

1. Looking at my routine, what are the likely reasons I’m not losing weight?
2. If you were me, what would you change *first*:
   * start tracking calories?
   * adjust meal composition/portion sizes?
   * change the fasting window / length?
   * change my workouts?
3. For those who were in a similar boat (doing IF but not losing), what finally made the difference for you?

I’m not looking for a magic fix – I just want some honest, practical feedback from people who’ve been through this. Thanks to anyone who takes the time to reply.",7,1767723609.0,intermittentfasting,30,0.89,False

1q5qd8c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q5qd8c,6th January 2026 — A Day Caught Between College & Fatigue," Today started a little better than usual. I woke up at 8:00 AM, but honestly, I had zero motivation to leave the bed. I don’t know why—just one of those mornings where your body refuses to cooperate. Eventually, I got up, went to the bathroom, had my syrup, and got dressed for college.
Going to college after so many days actually felt good. I packed my lunch and headed out. At the college gate, something unusual happened—the guard asked for my ID. They usually don’t, but today they did. After showing it, I went to the classroom and met my homies Aryaman and Raman. That instantly lifted my mood a bit.
I attended the class and saw Archi too. After that, I moved to the next class where Aryaman made a Hinge account, and we did some random chit-chat. Soon it was lunchtime, so we went to the ground and had chole, roti, and one samosa.
While we were eating, some puppies came over, probably hoping for food. Zoha and Sneha started playing with them—though Sneha honestly doesn’t know how to handle a puppy and ended up hurting its arm. That annoyed me.
After lunch, Prashant, Sahil, and I noticed some people playing football. We felt like joining them, so we did. We played for a while, got completely exhausted, and then decided to chill at the canteen with a cup of coffee.
Later, we went back to class. I watched Succession during the lecture, and once that class ended, I attended the cloud computing class. There, I casually bragged about my internship, and Archi turned back and gave me a look. That moment genuinely felt good.
After all the classes ended, I headed back home. While leaving college, Aditya stood beside Archi when I was taking my bike from her side—as if I was going to hit her or something. That pissed me off, but whatever.
Back home, I made a quick sandwich and had tea, relaxed a bit, and then went to the park for my workout. Still, the day felt unproductive—college drained all my time and energy.
After returning from the workout, I had muesli with full-cream milk, and later had dinner. Then I got into bed and wasted time scrolling through reels—again, unproductive.
Now, I’m finally writing this journal. The day is ending, and I’m feeling extremely sleepy. I just want to sleep peacefully.

1q5qcyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1q5qcyr/success_story_anecdote_asking_out_the_barista/,Success story anecdote... asking out the barista,"So I've seen several comments on Reddit saying that asking out a barista is GENERALLY frowned upon. And I totally get why. Baristas are just trying to work. They're just being friendly doing their job. Maybe they feel like they're being put on the spot in a public place with co-workers and customers around. Maybe it's awkward for the barista if they're not interested but continue to see the customer come in all the time. After taking all this into consideration, I tried a different (though not revolutionary) approach with the cute barista I've been wanting to ask out.

For context, I'm 37, been single since 30, I'm not a super attractive guy and rarely notice women looking my way... I'd say I'm a 6 out of 10 maybe? Live in an area where people who dress ""alt"" are not common at all. I dress alt, and so does she, so I think we noticed each other pretty quickly. She once complimented my sweater and I thought ""Oh, she's just being friendly. Maybe wanting a good tip."" But over time, I also noticed that every time I go in there, I ALWAYS catch her looking at me from across the shop and smiling. You absolutely have to be keen to observe body language and build some kind of rapport over time.

I decided to write a sticky note expressing that I find her attractive, wrote down my number, and said to contact me if she'd want to go out some time, followed by my name. I felt that this put the ball in her court and avoided putting her on the spot to give an immediate answer. An hour later while I was at work, she sends a very enthusiastic text saying she'd love to go out some time.

This is just my anecdotal situation for those who feel compelled to ask out a cute barista. Pay close attention to body language, build some kind of rapport with them over time, write a short and direct note, and BE PREPARED to be rejected or not hear from them. If rejection or no contact happens, do not try to pursue further. Don't make it awkward, rude, or creepy if you continue to go to that coffee shop.

I genuinely believed that if I wasn't personally overseeing every single pixel and every customer email, the whole thing would just crumble. The pressure was immense, a constant, dull ache behind my eyes.

I remember one particularly brutal week. We had a massive product launch coming up, a huge bug popped up, and a key investor call was looming. I hadn't slept more than three hours a night for a solid month. I was staring at my laptop screen at 3 AM, tears blurring the code, feeling this crushing, suffocating weight of responsibility. My brain just... froze. I couldn't write another line, couldn't send another email. It was pure, unadulterated burnout. I felt like a total failure, a fraud, and just wanted to quit right there.

The next morning, looking and feeling like a zombie, I dragged myself into our tiny office. For the first time, I truly *talked* to my small team. I was vulnerable, admitted I was completely overwhelmed, and asked for help. And you know what? They stepped up, big time. My co-founder took over the critical bug fix, our junior dev handled some urgent customer queries, and our marketing intern even prepped some slides for the investor call. I saw a spark in their eyes – a genuine desire to contribute and own parts of the business, which I had completely suppressed by micromanaging.

That day was a huge turning point. I learned the hard way that 'wearing all hats' isn't a badge of honor; it's a fast track to self-destruction and stifling your team. Trusting my team, empowering them, and delegating actual responsibilities not only saved my sanity but also made our product better and our company stronger. It wasn't just *my* startup anymore; it became *ours*.

It’s crazy how sometimes you have to hit rock bottom to realize the most fundamental lessons. Letting go felt terrifying at first, like jumping off a cliff, but it was the best decision I ever made. We ended up nailing the launch, impressing the investor, and I even got some actual sleep! The relief was palpable, like shedding a heavy cloak I didn't even realize I was wearing.

So, fellow founders and aspiring entrepreneurs, what's been your biggest ""aha!"" moment or a lesson you learned the hard way that completely changed your approach?",1,1767723507.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False
