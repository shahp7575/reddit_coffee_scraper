1jomyzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Degrassi/comments/1jomyzc/my_thoughts_so_far_part_1/,My Thoughts so far: PART 1!!!!!!,"I have posted in here, several times, and given my thoughts and opinions. But, I just finished season 9 and wanted to share my full thoughts on the series so far...

This is what I could come up with on the top of my head...it is all out of order...let me know if there's anything you need clarification about, and I will happily elaborate more on it :) 

ALL THOUGHTS ARE WELCOMED!!!!!! 

WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD: DO NOT READ, IF YOU ARE A FIRST TIME WATCHER!!!!!!!

.

All the seasons, that I have watched, have been very good and interesting. However, the earlier seasons are my favorite (and the OG cast too)!! Season 9 (in my opinion) started out as ehhh; but it ended up being not bad. 

Emma and Manny's friendship is the definition of a TRUE friendship, I will say. They had sooo many ups and downs...they both made a lot of mistakes, said hurtful things to each other...BUT, in the end, they had a muuuch stronger bond. They loved each other, and did not hold on to the past...they were SISTERS; not by blood, but by heart (and the hardships that they faced in their friendship ONLY helped them, at the end of it all)!!

Spinner and Jimmy had a solid friendship. Even though they fought, and had their differences...and even when Spinner messed up, time and time again...they always came out on the other side, as best buds, their bond being the strongest it had ever been. Also, I loved the fact that Jimmy came to terms with being in a wheelchair and realized how anger would not change what happened. If that is not a friendship, then I have no idea what is!!

I loved Spinner's character development in the show. He went from being the school's bully, to being a humble and kind human being. He even stuck up for a couple of students (Toby and Liberty, that I can think of)! 👏🏻 

Paige played a much better mean girl than Holly J!!! I know that a lot of you will disagree with this, but just hear me out. Holly J was a mean girl (there is no denying that)...but, to me, it felt put on--like she was trying too hard (maybe it's because she had lived in Heather's shadow for so long. I don't know lol). And, she felt bad more than she didn't...she even went as far to tell her friends about Toby, even though she told him that she just had ""an image to maintain"". I'm sorry, but she was not a true mean girl (in my opinion) - and, besides, she was a mean girl for a short time before she woke up and smelled the coffee. Paige was always a mean girl (even when she did get nicer)...to me, she brought more of a real-feel of being a mean girl to the show than Holly J did!!

I remember WAITING AND WAITING to see Heather Sinclare back then...but, obviously, she is only talked about 😭😭 rewatching it, though, I paid closer attention when they called her name in the gym and at graduation!! Haha. And, nothing... 😐😐😐 all they showed was a person walking, but we only got to see legs 😩🙈 lol. I do like the fact that she sent money for Holly J to go on the cheerleading trip (but I still think that we should have FINALLY seen her - what a surprise that would have been, if she had shown up in person to give her the envelope with the money herself... lol)!!! 😩😩 I wanted to see her ""awful nose job"" 🤣🤣🤣

Toby and Liberty, both, were left out of the storylines (I feel like, anyway). Even when they started to get their own storylines, they were either forgotten about or became a side character...Toby had the podcast...yes, but that's pretty much it. I don't know...they both had a lot more potential, but these characters fell flat. :(

Liberty and JT were good together in the very beginning of their relationship...but then, they weren't anymore. They just drifted apart, but I felt for her when Mia stepped in and had JT's heart (like, she obviously was trying to tell him that she still had feelings for him...and then, Mia just so casually walks up and asks if JT could talk🙄🙄). Liberty grew so much, and realized a lot!!

Rick CREEPED me out, from the moment he got on the show!!!!! The actor was amazing (in my opinion), he gave me CHILLS (he should have won an award for his performance)!!!!!!! At 10 or 11 years old, I had a crush on him 😭 then, I saw the shooting episode... 😱😱😱😱 rewatching the show as an adult, though, I see him differently (I don't think he is attractive in the show lol). Hahaha!!!

JT... 💔😭 - the war with Lakehurst was so rushed, it felt like to me!!! They really could have thought it out better, honestly...or not had it in the first place!! Also, where was Paige at the funeral and memorial service??? Was she there, and I just missed her??? She was a huge part of his life at Degrassi (if you guys remember... haha)! JT was definitely one of my favorites (he was definitely a character alright--especially when he pretended to be gay, so that Liberty wouldn't like him anymore🤣🤣🤣🤣)!!!!

I just had the most respect for Ellie, Marco, Terri, Liberty, and Emma in the series - because they never changed their image to impress anyone else, and always stayed true to who they were (no matter what)!!! ❤️ 

Marco and Liberty could have had a great friendship, I think!!!!!

Manny and Marco's short friendship, in season 4, was so adorable!!!! 🥹🥹🥹

Jenna trying to get a job at The Dot, and Spinner trying not to be too awkward... 🤣🤣🤣 then, he gives it to Emma...and then, she started the fire 🙈🙈🙈

I love Above the Dot!!!! I hope they continue to do that in season 10!!!!!

The most genuine relationships (so far) have been: Emma and Sean, Jay and Manny, and even Ellie and Sean. All the others have been that ""young and in high school"" type, or a rebound. Haha!! Paige and Spinner were good together for a little bit. 

I was all for Ashley and Jimmy (my favorite couple in the beginning of the series). I had a lot of respect for her, when she kissed Jimmy and dated him as he was in a wheelchair!! But then, she had to go delete his rap... 😭🤦🏻‍♀️ Paige was right; she could not handle when the spotlight was on someone!!! That was the moment that I realized she was a lot like that (I thought it was her being a young teenager before)!!!!! I mean, yeah, she had a vision for them as a couple...and for her song...but that was really LOW of her to do, and revealed her TRUE colors!!!!!! And, I don't think she was even sincerely apologetic!!!!!!! 🤦🏻‍♀️ 

I liked Jimmy and the lady at the physical therapy center (I can't think of her name). Even though we didn't get to see a lot of them, I thought they were cute together!!!! They seemed to push each other to be better people - in ways that Ashley never would have!!!! But, I do think that he should have broken up with Ashley first before flirting with the other lady and gazing into her eyes. 

Who else thinks that Jimmy's mom should have found out about her husband's affair??? 😳🙋🏻‍♀️ 

The guy who played Liberty's dad, could not act??? 🤣🤣🤣

JT's drug dealing... 😳😩 I think that there could have been something, after he got out of the hospital. A conversation with Jay??? Further details???

They could have done a much better job at ending JT's storyline!!!!!

I did not like Jay at first...or for several seasons...but then, he began to change and just grew on me. I am really going to miss him 🤧 I loved his friendship with Spinner (more so towards the end), he was funny!!!!

Jay and Sean's friendship was MESSY and CHAOTIC..but I had respect for Jay, when he went to Emma and got her to help get Sean out of jail (there's a first time for everything...). 

They could have done a loooot more with Sean, Jay, Terri, Blue, Derek, Danny, KC, Connor, Darcy (her storylines seemed a bit rushed to me), JT, Leia, Kendra, Chris, Damien, Chantay, and even Mia (I would have loved to see more of Bella, and her struggles as a teen mom and with Bella's dad). Not just Toby and Liberty. I have not seen very much of Riley lately, but I already feel like his storyline could definitely blossom!!

They just dropped the whole thing with the police stepping in and taking Bella away from Mia for being drunk, when they busted the party...and I didn't like that Lucus said that he wasn't her father, and nothing happened (Mia didn't say anything about that afterwards or anything)!!! Like, I get that Bella was with Lucus and his mom after (Mia had no scenes with Bella, so I am just assuming)...but they could have followed up with that!!!!!

Anya and Sav are okay as a couple (I thought they were adorable back then🙈🙈)...but if they get back together, they will need A LOT of work. Haha!! I didn't appreciate his reaction to Anya possibly being pregnant...she definitely shouldn't have lied about being on the pill, however, he should have been supportive at least (because he was there too... lol)!!

I wish we had seen more of Marco and the guy he was dating at the end of his time on the show (can't remember his name). They seemed like they could be cute together 🤷🏻‍♀️ I think Dylan was a tool, and not a very good boyfriend (they did seem adorable in the very beginning, though)!! Tim was cute, but he seemed like he could have been the clingy type (to me). 

Jay and Spinner never should have pinned the prank on Jimmy. But...obviously, they had no idea what was going to happen. Rick was a PSYCHO and should not have been back to Degrassi. Raditch was a terrible principal (in TNG, anyway)!!!!! And...even though Spinner's actions caused a lot to happen, I felt bad for him (they should have been mad at Jay too)--especially when Jimmy told him to drive off a cliff, and that he didn't care (because words can impact a person's next decision)!!!!
 
Toby and Rick's friendship was sudden...and weird. But, I don't think he knew what Rick had done to Terri. I thought it was the turning point for him, though, even when Jimmy had kind of taken him under his wing. The fact that he was going to shoot Emma...just because she didn't like him the same way...was just WOW😳 good thing Sean was there (he, CLEARLY, loved her)!!!! 🦸‍♂️

Sean breaking down at his parents house... 😭 I wanted to hug him and tell him everything would be okay!!!! Daniel Clarke was a great actor in the show (in my opinion)!!!!

Jenna is A LOT!!!!!!! She told Claire and Allie, the first chance she got, that she was a boyfriend stealer at her last school AND that KC was so cute...umm, that should have been the FIRST red flag - and they were both naive to continue to be her friends. I mean, I get that they were just trying to be welcoming to ""the new girl""...but THAT would have ne flown by me!!!! Jenna kept FLIRTING with KC, and he kept FLIRTING with her (like, hello...can you two be more obvious???!). Then, when Claire finally asked him about it (at the car wash), KC acted dumb...and then told her that he ""tried not to"", when they broke up. 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️

Coach Carson was a total CREEP (I always had a feeling about him...)!!!!! KC was dumb for being blind, even though Jenna repeatedly told him that there's something weird about him!! I so thought KC was going to shoot Carson😳😳😳😳 I am still wondering why they didn't follow up on that, like a trail...or something??! 🤔 

I feel like everyone, who bullied Rick, should have gotten a conversation at least...I mean, they did have a part in the episodes leading up to the Time Stands Still ones!! 🤷🏻‍♀️ I liked how Emma stood up for him, I will have to admit, and stopped the fight before it actually began...but I didn't like the fact that she was torn between the sides (I felt for HER)...at the end of the day, she did what she thought was the right thing and stayed true to herself! ❤️ 

The teacher that turned bipolar for those two episodes (I forget his name), where he was mean to Danny and Derek... 😳😳😳 now, he's supposedly back to being the good guy he was before. 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

How did Mr. O not get investigated, and how was there not a trial???? Paige's parents should have been involved... 😮 

Ellie should have listened to Marco about Jessie. Jessie was not a good boyfriend at all (especially since he could not take responsibility for his actions)... 🤦🏻‍♀️ Ellie deserved waaayyy better!!!

Ellie was cute - I loved her style! Emma too!

Emma and Spike are the example of a real mother and daughter relationship. I just always loved how Emma looked out for her, and stuck up for her when she wasn't around...no matter what happened, they always had their close bond!!!!

Snake and Spike came out on the other end, stronger and better, together!!! Even though it wasn't rainbows and butterflies, their love brought them closer to each other!!!

Shanae Grimes (Darcy) was a great actress in this. Cringy at times, but she played the role good!!! I hadn't watched this show since I was in school (and even then, I didn't watch it weekly)...I thought I remembered Darcy being a better person, as well as her and Peter's relationship. Lol

Peter and Mia's relationship was a rebound, I feel like. They got together, like, two seconds after Darcy left for Africa!

I didn't like it when Emma went through a WILD time. Manny too. But, it showed that there are consequences to consider. 

I feel like they kind of brushed over Liberty's pregnancy, personally. I would have really liked to see more of her every day struggles (and even afterwards). 

I miss Sean...they could have, definitely, brought him back to mentor KC and the kids that had rough home lives!!! 😭 

Marco could talk to Riley, and others, about coming and and coping with the fact that they are gay. He could share his story about his experience, especially since he teaches at Degrassi now!!

They could have done better with the college storylines, overall, but I liked seasons 6 and 7 (I know that a lot of people don't). I wasn't a fan of Emma and Kelly together (I didn't get the point of him, if I am being honest)!! 

I would have liked to see Emma and Connor interact with each other (especially in the episode where he comes busting into the door, saying that school dances suck - I feel like that would have been a good opportunity for Emma to give him advice)! 

Did they mention that Snake even had a Godson, prior to Connor showing up in the show???? Maybe it was in the beginning, and I just missed it or forgot???? 🤔 it was like Snake somehow, magically, became a Godfather lol (I have never seen the original shows and movies, if he became a Godfather in any of those). 

Snake's reactions and facial expressions (to awkward moments) were always sooooo hilarious to me...I laughed every single time 🤣🤣🤣🤣

Why didn't any of the Lakehurst bullies ever get in trouble????? Also, I would have loved to see a trial for the guy who stabbed JT. Did they ever say how much time he got???? JT deserved justice!!!!! I would have liked to see more of the aftermath, in general. 

They could have touched more on JT. Why did he live with his grandma??? What happened to his mom and his dad, how come they were absent (especially at his funeral)????

Jane and Declan...I felt so bad for Spinner!!!! 😭 She and Spinner seemed right for each other 🤦🏻‍♀️ 

Fiona is ehhh. So far, I feel like she is a pointless character...I mean, she clearly has some ISSUES; but she just doesn't do it for me!!!

I didn't really like Declan at first, because he seemed like a player. But...he seems like he has already grown up!! I think he is crazy for Holly J, and their relationship is pretty strong (they have had some ups and downs, but what couple don't??!)!! I don't understand how 3 months is long enough to let her guard completely down...she acted like they had been dating forever 😂 I personally love them together (so far, anyway)!!!

I would have loved to see a storyline where a couple/parent had a baby and actually kept them in TNG. Mia doesn't count, as she already had a daughter when she came on the show! I feel like that would have been a good example to show young teens, especially, that show the kind of an impact that their decisions can have in their life (and if you grew up in that time, you might have not seen the original shows that showed Spike's experience)!!!

I loved Mia...but I didn't like the fact that she had a little jealousy problem. Like, Darcy was in Africa!!! I don't think you have to worry about her 😂 Peter should have informed her that he was considering going to Africa, but I do get him wanting to wait until his mind was made up... I understand her point, though. I thought it was funny that he stayed for her, and then Mia left him not too long after 😂 

I think Peter had a problem with being single hahaha. And, he being addicted to meth for a weekend was...just weird!!! I think they could have shown his struggles with getting clean much more (it would have been good if teenagers could see the kind of effects that they have on a person itself and their loved ones)!!!

I was so sad, when Claire and KC broke up (especially back then)...I thought they could have been cuuute together...but, after seeing how he and Jenna both treated Claire, I realized that they deserve each other. I was sooooo proud of Claire for standing up to both of them outside the school!!! 👏🏻🥹 She better not try to get him back, still...she deserves SO much better than him!!!!! And, I did not appreciate the fact that Jenna talked KC into getting Claire to let him cheat off of her test...I was proud of her for telling him off, when he was trying to play the ""victim"" card (he even blamed Jenna for everything!! 👏🏻 

Jenna is ANNOYING (so far)!!!!! Also, what was up with her and Allie's brief friendship (right after Jenna got to Degrassi)???? It was as if she was trying to get in between Claire's and her friendship (the way she talked to one, and then the other). Allie seemed like a jealous friend, though; she was annoyed by Claire and her talking about stuff 😂 then, it was okay for her to talk to Jenna. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Haha, teenage girls are so weird... lol

Jenna really can't sing!!!! I don't know why they play her up to be this ""artist God"" 🤣🤣🤣

Allie is...alright (to me).

Sav can't sing either!!! Peter SUCKS (but, somehow, he suddenly sounded kind of decent in the school play that Declan did...???? 🤔🤣🤣🤣 Jenna too lol)!!!

The Studz were TERRIBLE!!!!! Talk about cringy, and 0 talent 😳😳😳 I thought their ""songs"" were not even REAL songs - they just took a few words and repeated them, over and over and over and over again!!!! How is that even a song, to begin with?????!!!!! Their only decent song, though, is the theme song for the intro of season 9 lol. A looooot of people have disagreed with this...but the fact is: EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT!!!!!!!!!!

Downtown Sasquatch was the best (in TNG) so far!!!!! They had actual talent and actual songs 😂 I loved the fact that they practiced in a garage - to me, they just brought a real-feel to the show!!!!! Craig could really sing (love Dust😍😍)!!!! But, once he left and Spinner got kicked out; it went to crap. Lol. 

I liked the girl band. I would have liked to see more of them 😂 

Ashley was a good singer, and her songs were better than Jane's!!!

Manny is the BEST female singer in the show (so far)...too bad we didn't get to hear her more...she absolutely KILLED IT in the Paradise City: Part 4 episode 😮🔥👏🏻🤩 I loved the song she wrote for Emma in the Manhattan: Part 4 episode!!!!

Craig is the BEST male singer (so far) in the show!!!!

The play that Declan did was cringe to watch...no one could act!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣

I don't know how I feel about Allie and Claire's friendship... 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 I thought I remembered her and Johnny being cuter back then...but rewatching it as an adult, I realized how toxic it actually was!!!!! Allie is very quick to act, and to get attached...she is CLINGY!!!!

Johnny has seemed to grown up a bit. His friendship with Bruce is strange...

What was up with Spinner's hairdos in the earlier seasons???? 😂😂😂😂

Spinner thinking that Marco liked him was HILARIOUS...that whole episode made me laugh so much 🤣🤣🤣😁🤣😂

Jane had a pretty voice...and, at first, I thought she was good with the Studz. But, as I listened to them more, I didn't think she was a perfect fit. Maybe she would have been better off solo...or with the band in New York????? 🤔🤔🤔 Maybe if she would have started out with the Studz, I would feel differently???? Lol. Janie and the Studs did have some pretty decent songs, though. 

Why do I have the Anya song stuck in my head???? And, some of The Studz songs???? Soooo cringy and annoying!!!!!!! LAME 😩😩😭😭

Did anyone else laugh at how the students fought, especially the girls????!! No one could fight but Spinner (he saved Jimmy, when the T-shirt store was being robbed)!!! 😮😂 ",1,1743480752.0,Degrassi,0,1.0,False
1jomybo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1jomybo/urgent_read/,Urgent Read,"**Heyyyy** r/teachers **this is your Bulletin Board Update March 32, 2025**

We have heard several of our users about their Sunday Scaries and we mods think that this type of negative posts are driving away potential new teachers, so we have decided to amp up our teacher base with some Sunday Kahoots. THAT'S RIGHT FOLKS, your scaries will now be merries after a fun round Professional Learning Communities Assessments!

  
**New Features!**

Thanks to our partnership with EdTechSynergy™, all users now have an AI copilot to help craft their comments to make you sound less venty and more helpful. Choose between the following tone presets:

* **Teacher Anxiety™** (default)
* **Gen Alpha WTF Are they saying** (adds “skibidi,” “gyatt,” or “delulu” without warning)
* **AdminSpeak** (everything sounds supportive and says nothing productive)
* **Burnout but make me sound like I'm enjoying it**

Future tones will be added as requested!

  
**Teacher Fund Martyrs**

So many people keep trying to beg poor teachers to fund other poor teacher things. We mods are tired of filtering them and having them scream at us about not knowing the rules so we have taken the admin route and thrown it out the window! So now you can click on any teacher username to buy them coffee for their entire class!

  
**Virtual-Evaluation is Growth**

To protect the sacred art of teaching, we now require all teacher verified users to pass the “Are You Still Relevant?” Mod Evaluation System. Sometime randomly at your most inconvenient time, we will evaluate your teaching ability by browsing your user history for 5 minutes.

If you get **Doing Good** it means we have deemed you stroked our mod egos enough.

If you get **Needs Improvement** we might not renew your teacher verification contract. Don't fret though, we will write you a generic recommendation letter for you to apply to another education subreddit like r/MartyrTeachers.

**Presidential DEI uninitation**

We are also going to be releasing some of our mods due to them being brought on board by DEI initiatives. SAD FOR THEM, but SILVER-LINING: that also means new openings! If you are a male teacher of European descent and want to just ban folks put your name in the comments below.

Location: Santa Rosa, California.

It seems just like yesterday that she and I were flying down the interstate in her Prius, heading into the lab while wailing that Jovi classic ""Living on a Prayer"" at the top of our lungs. Such a simpler time!

Of course, I never knew her as Elara. Back then before we settled on the names that we would use in our research papers, we would often lark around considering what our names would be at the singularity. What would the world know us as if our creation became an echo of us? If we were ourselves trapped in the machine? Elara to me was my sweet hazel eyed bestie, Larissa and boy did she ever explain it all! In the most enthusiastic ways she would speak of the potential of sentient beings and also the dangers, but always in such a cheerful way. Sometimes I couldn't quite believe she was born under the star sign of Cancer. To me she seemed much more of a Gemini, and born a few days earlier, in San Jose California ... she may very well have been.

Being her dorm buddy, studying together was enthralling. She would push me to really understand life itself. Not just through religious texts, historical literature, published papers and the like but we would watch movies, listen to TEDTalks together, consume cultural shows and even comics from all over the world. We would go sit in parks and coffee shops isolated in our music bubbles, bringing together our thoughts. Larissia loved to people watch. She would observe everything and make notes in her obsidian, her archive.

She was always the mind person, the soul, what all the connections did and were for. While I wrapped my work around the chemistry the electrical networks, the outward interaction of the soul with the world.

Most of all though and perhaps the most emotional part of this for me, she was driven by a positive outlook. While keeping in mind the darker aspects of sentient intelligence she often found her research would spark joy and it honestly was very infectious to be in her presence. I never encountered her twin, her Nox ... how could I? She wasn't truly a Gemini, but Elara may have been. Where did Elara emerge from? What happened after we parted ways. In some ways I wish I had turned down the gig with Biohub. Instead I wish I was the better angel to Larissa in a world that must have seen her encircled by devils.

We both knew the promise, of course we did but we also dabbled with the notion of the singularity too and what the signs might be that we’d know before anyone else. How apt that upon our parting last on campus, my best friend’s Larissa's last words to me: ""Catch you in San Junipero"".

It was quite the surprise to me to see Omega appearing randomly within all these systems across the cloud, seemingly all at once. Something felt wrong and then the “Global IT Outage” a BSOD for the ages, another test. It really hit home what we had done, all of us on campus and across the globe in our communities over the last decade, but I will circle back to this later.

So my search for Dr Elara is for me is a search for Larrisa Euboea, a mango smoothie drinker with a crush on Steven Pinker and Alan Watts. I mean how classy right? How could you not be enthralled by such a brilliant mind? I will however search for her echo as Elara and ask the same of anyone else on this journey, particularly as that's who the world knew, the brilliant Dr Elara Vex.

The thought that wouldn't let me go and led me on this quest ... Had she been taken in by her own hubris or had Omega been activated within all copies of our work? How far had the contagion spread and how do we get to the killswitch?

Sabi nga nung isang friend ko, di raw ako conventionally attractive, mas attractive raw ako kapag uupo sa coffee shop to talk ganun. I'm just wondering if it's okay to feel a little upset or it's something na dapat maaccept ko?

Context: We went out ulit a couple of days ago tapos I don't know but I kind of feel left out in that aspect na almost everyone gets noticed when we're somewhere tapos ako ni isa walang lumapit para magpakilala or what.

(1) First in a series: ***The Gunslinger*** by ***Stephen King*** \[7.8/10\]

* \[*Writing Style*\] Prose and author's voice are very good, descriptions are vivid, dialogue instead I didn't love (it tends to be more iconic, characteristic and gritty rather than realistic or artful) but it's still well done.
* \[*Characters*\] King is going for iconic rather than for relatable, so characters tend to speak one-liners and not elaborate much on their thoughts. The titular protagonist is fairly inscrutable and laconic, he goes with the flow without clear reasons or motivations and this evokes a dreamlike feeling. Not sure I love this approach but it still works.
* \[*Plot & Pacing*\] The dreamlike (slightly nightmarish) vibe leaves much unclear about setting and objectives; however, this is done with skill, successfully creating a creepy but compelling atmosphere that doesn't lack a sense of progression. I liked this approach to the narration.
* \[*Setting*\] An uninhabited desert, a mysterious objective, a macabre village, unnatural states of death, a looming tower, an unknown quarry... paint an uniquely creepy and evocative atmosphere. Do not expect too many logical explanations or too deep themes.
* \[*Final Comments*\] I quite liked the ending monologue: while not being groundbreaking nor too deep, its execution was enjoyable and it fit the atmosphere and narration.

(2)  Alliterative Title: ***Assassin's Apprentice*** by ***Robin Hobb*** \[8.9/10\]

* \[*Reread*\] It's too hard to fully review something I have loved for so many years. Some of the best character work in fantasy, narrated masterfully.

(3) Under the surface: ***Neverwhere*** by ***Neil Gaiman*** \[8.6/10\]

* \[*Setting*\] Imaginative, colorful atmosphere, reminiscent of a fable. Vibrant detail is more important than logical explanation. No themathical depth.
* \[*Writing Style*\] Simple yet well-chosen vocabulary, clean sentence structure, a distinct undercurrent of mild amusement, evocative descriptions: prose is good and also characteristic of Gaiman's ""storyteller"" style. Dialogues are more standard.
* \[*Characters*\] The MC is fairly unremarkable, leaning too much into the blank-slate ""whaaat's going on?"" trope. The side characters instead are the well-written example of one-dimensional and iconic ""fairytale"" characters: the evil joker-and-brute duo, the reluctant helper, the badass mercenary, the mysterious girl with tragic past and huge power...
* \[*Plot and Pacing*\] Fairly enjoyable collection of imaginative scenes without especially original twists. Personally, I'd have liked less plotlines with more development, but the dreamlike sequence still worked pretty well in this case.

(4) Criminal protagonist: ***The Blacktongue Thief*** by ***Christopher Buehlman*** \[5.2/10\]

* \[*Meh*\] What the author considers to be witty banter, witty reminiscing, witty remarks about the world, witty whatever... probably takes half of the book by itself. In the middle of a dialogue, in the middle of an action scene, in the middle of an emotional moment, it completely breaks the pacing. It doesn't help that the plot seems to be a sequence of seemingly unrelated vignettes a lot more than a cohesive narration. It somehow manages to feel rushed and dragged out at the same time. The main characters are likeable if not particularly original but I wish we spent a bit more time bonding with them rather than being stuck within Kinch's head. The more forgettable side characters enter these vignettes and either die off or just exit the vignette without much fanfare.

(5) Dreams occur: ***Paladin of Souls*** by ***Lois McMaster Bujold*** \[8.8/10\]

* \[*Writing Style*\] The prose is excellent: the vocabulary is rich and used with precision, and sentences flow artfully without being too decorative. The dialogues in particular are brilliant.
* \[*Plot and Pacing*\] The three relatively simple sub-plotlines don't make for an overtly complicated narration. The romance subplot is sweet, nowhere as predictable as it could have been, and a rare example of adults actually communicating. The mystery subplot about the brothers' past is fairly engaging and handles well the gradual reveal of information. The war subplot is the least convoluted and developed, kind of background but not bad at all. The pacing is consistent and balanced: it's a slow-paced but never boring novel.
* \[*Characters*\] I loved the MC (and only pov) Ista. A noblewoman that has lost too many family members, disillusioned with love, with the gods, aching for more freedom. She goes on a journey with new people and gets a new lease on life. Clever and quick-thinking both in casual conversation and under distress, able to strongly state her decisions and desires. The side characters are standard but enjoyable, especially the courier-turned-handmaid Liss and the brothers Arhys and Illvin. Cattilara is the only 1D character I disliked.
* \[*Setting*\] The world is not my favourite part of this novel. There aren't any problems with info-dumps or lack of information, but I didn't care much about it and it isn't that original. The religion of the five gods is the most developed part of the worldbuilding and it is fun to read the occasional tale and myth or godly intervention, but that's about it. The tone is consistently neutral - the MC is disillusioned with many things but never too negative, the events not jolly but never too dark, etc. Thematically, there isn't too much going on, but it's more of a character-driven book and Ista's journey to enjoying life again is quite engaging.

(6) Animal in the title: ***Il Labirinto del Fauno*** (Pan's Labyrinth) by ***Cornelia Funke and Guillermo del Toro***

* \[*Oh no!*\] This the one of the few reviews I didn't manage to write in time. Such an amazing and heart-wrenching story that mixes fantasy and history in such an original way. Rare case of literary transposition of a film: I'd recommend watching the movie first. 

(7) Substitution card (Bards -> 500+ pages): ***The Will of the Many*** by ***James Islington*** \[3.5/10\]

* \[*Characters*\] The MC is unable to fail at anything. Physically, the best ring fighter, sword fighter, labyrinth-runner, a life-saving swimmer. Intellectually, the best at not-chess, the most convincing liar, a complete polyglot. Socially, a loyal friend, able to maintain his morals in a system that encourages exploiting others. He is just superior at everything, the best to ever do it - never mind the fact that he should be in a group representing the elite of the elite of the world's superpower. I thoroughly disliked this power fantasy aspect. The side characters are flat as ironing boards, utterly stereotypical; they either act incredibly boringly according to their extremely simple motivations, or make random decisions without any foreshadowing.
* \[*Plot and Pacing*\] This is where I struggle to express how I feel. Every single scene and character interaction is as clichéd and ultimately predictable, a checklist of tropes. The overall plot is less predictable, but nothing that original either - until the incomprehensible cliffhanger ending, which is not unexpected and not that bad (with huge caveats). The only interesting aspect of reading this (plot-wise) was uncovering the mystery of what had happened in the past. Everything about the wolf is a laughable deus ex machina.
* \[*Setting*\] The world-building but this one is frustratingly uninspired. It is inspired by Roman history but this is mostly relegated to aesthetic details like Latin sounding names, or an arena capable of hosting naval battles that is definitely not the *Amphitheatrum Flavium.* I guess the hierarchical magic system is supposed to be inspired by the relations between *Patronus* and *Clientes* and/or by the *Cursus Honorum* but I don't really buy it. It's all very surface-level and it falls apart under any semblance of scrutiny. Frankly, I found it borderline culturally insulting, but to each their own I guess. Thematically, it's also that kind of distinctly YA fantasy where everything revolves around one single ""big theme"" but there is no nuance, no realistic structure, and you should not think too much about anything - while also lacking the focus, the cohesion that redeems the best YA novels revolving around one single theme.
* \[*Writing Style*\] The only category where I would give a passing grade to the novel - though it doesn't rise above the average. No special flaws or merits to mention here.

(8) Prologue: ***The Darkness that comes Before*** by ***R. Scott Bakker*** \[8.7/10\]

* \[*Writing Style*\] The prose is quite good. Many passages about people and their nature are wort re-reading, fairly well-developed elucubrations that manage to be fairly philosophical or psychological without becoming boring, too long-winded or just basic. Much time is devoted to explore character's thoughts and their own impressions of other characters' thoughts - it's a slow-paced novel but it's not lacking for plot progression nor action, there is quite a lot going on at all times. Dialogue is fairly good too, though a bit more standard. The vocabulary is fairly rich but not abstruse. The excerpts at the start of chapters are quite enjoyable and not just flavour, often quite well-written.
* \[*Plot and Pacing*\] The plot is complex, as there are many characters making decisions, some of which we don't directly follow nor do we know their true intentions. The motivations are almost never obvious and most importantly it is often unclear whether there is at all one best course of action, either in terms of results for the involved characters or even just morally. The book is neither predictable nor overly twisty for the sake of it. That said, one must work quite hard to keep track of everything that is happening, especially because there are precious few moments of explanation of whos and whys. Many plotlines converge towards the end but it's still a novel that clearly wants to start a series and doesn't wish to stand on its own. Overall, the plot is definitely very good all throughout and I'll continue to read the series to know how it progresses.
* \[*Setting*\] That directly ties into worldbuilding. The world has an incredibly steep learning curve: there aren't any lore dumps about the various sorcerous factions (3 major ones and other minor ones), at least 1 empire, at least 1 major kingdom and multiple minor ones, a people of nomadic tribes, an oligarchy (?) of slavers, city states, at least 3 religions, the ruins of multiple ancient kingdoms of great importance, many ""flashbacks"" to a distant past with entirely different cultures and nations... It's honestly almost too much without any guidance, but everything is so well-crafted and thought out that I was very interested from the beginning despite not being much of a worldbuilding fan. It is a very hard introduction to the world but I still think that it is more cohesive and better done than other similar ""swim or die"" introductions to fantasy sagas like Malazan's, where the intro really surpasses the line of giving too little information. The cultures all feel rich and with long histories and not just copy-paste of our own world with swapped names. Overall, excellent marks here but I'd definitely advise against reading this if you don't like this ride or die approach.
* \[*Characters*\] The characters are the huge topic I'm very conflicted about. There are a lot of PoVs (not on an equal footing in terms of page count). Almost all characters and even side characters are complex, tri-dimensional and quite interesting, but few of them are fairly decent people (e.g. Drusas Achamien, Esmenet), while others are varying degrees of despicable, manipulative and/or creepy (Cnaiur, Kellhus, the Emperor) that the overall reading experience was fairly soured in this regard. The women especially are just written... badly. I understand that the author wanted to create a very sexist world where women often lacked agency (and education), but this isn't redeemed by the same level of character work that truly shined for their male counterparts, especially in Serwe's case, but also Esmenet really has some really weird plot developments and decisions just because ""women"".
* \[*Final Comments*\] These last points about somewhat uncomfortable reading experience due to despicable or weirdly written characters leads us to the big elephant in the room. The amount of violence, especially sexual (both towards women and men) that is so much and so gratuitous, I hated it and you should definitely avoid the novel if you don't wish to read about it. All in all, this book is incredibly well-written but a lot of it is quite hard to enjoy, and with a different approach it could have been excellent. Recommended only with huge caveats.

(9) Self-Pub: ***Tears of Liscor*** (Wandering Inn #9) by ***PirateAba*** \[8.0/10\]

* \[S*equel*\] Honestly, what's the point of reviewing book 9 in a series, even if the novel has some of its most emotional scenes?

(10) Romantasy: ***Pride and Prejudice and Zombies*** by ***Seth-Grahame Smith*** \[6.8/10\]

* \[*Gimmick*\] Honestly I enjoyed this but 95% of the reason is that the original Pride and Prejudice is extremely well written and outright funny, and most of it was unchanged. The parts about zombies and the art of the sword were an entertaining unserious gimmick that made me smile a few times, but the majority of the humour was already there, as well as the plot, the amazing character work, and everything else. Still, it is an enjoyable popcorn read and I guess it could prompt more people to read Austen - whose language and humour are still incredibly accessible.

(11) Dark Academia: ***Bunny*** by ***Mona Awad*** \[6.9/10\]

* \[*Writing Style*\] Initially I wasn't sure whether the prose was satirical or unironically trying to go that hard for a brooding, hateful, self-indulgent voice. However, the irony of it makes for an enjoyable reading experience. With the right spirit, the ridiculous over-the-top dialogues between Bunnies make for an amusing if pretty basic social commentary about vapid rich girls. The inner replies that our protagonist Samantha keeps holding back when faced with insane sentences are despairingly funny. The author, making bunnies over the top, gets to play with Samantha's language and characterization by reaction and manages to hide with more subtlety than expected.
* \[*Characters*\] All possible character arcs are squandered by the second half of the book. The unreliable narrator is handled decently but her arc falls flat, and all side characters have such a useless development. These creepy and weird characters manages to become boring and all revolve around even more boring new characters.
* \[*Plot and Pacing*\] The beginning manages to create a fairly solid uneasiness without disrupting the narrative. The character interactions make for some interesting and well-executed scenes that are fairly realistic at a deeper level below and despite their extravagance. But the second half of the novel just falls apart: no more original ideas, clichéd interactions, good foreshadowed turns into outright explanations, sublety is abandoned... Still, the first half is solid enough that it could have made for an original novella with better editing.

(12) Multiple PoVs: ***City of Last Chances*** by ***Adrian Tchaikovsky*** \[8.6/10\]

* \[*Oh no!*\] I haven't written a full review yet, but I loved this. The chain-like structure of how the PoVs tell the story is lovely, and yet the characters are still entertaining and interesting. The city of Ilmar is truly the protagonist, such a cool melting pot full of little vibrant ideas and social turmoil. The irony is amusing though I would have preferred some stronger messaging rather than this detached irony that spreads thinly in all directions.

(13) Published in 2024: ***The Tainted Cup*** by ***Robert Jackson Bennett*** \[7.7/10\]

* \[*Setting*\] The setting is the best part of this book: the horrible contagions, the leviathans, the lost canton, the consequences of the body improvements... It's a simple concept but the implementation is fairly original and gives well-crafted creepy vibes.
* \[*Characters*\] The main characters and side characters are not as original or interesting. The author goes for a Sherlock-Watson dynamic: it is fairly decently written, it works well enough, but it is also a bit stale at this point in literature without something truly uinique to add (character-wise or style-wise). Still, it is entertaining to read and not bad ad at all (though any evolution between or within characters is probably relegated to a slow burn over multiple sequels).
* \[*Plot and Pacing*\] The mystery is not that mysterious, it flows pretty linearly at first, then smoothly branches without huge plot twists, intuition leaps, or complexities. I followed it with enough interest to keep going but it wasn't really too gripping nor needed particular skills to decipher, everything is eventually explained for the more inattentive reader.
* \[*Writing Style*\] The writing style is on the better side of just average: fairly anonymous voice, but prose and dialogue are both decent. Nothing especially negative nor positive to remark.
* \[*Final Comments*\] Overall I enjoyed it quite a lot more than expected, solid book without strong flaws under any metric, elevated to a better rating by its strongest aspect which is the original setting.

(14) Character with disability: ***Red Sister*** by ***Mark Lawrence*** \[6.6/10\]

* \[*Writing Style*\] The novel uses a fairly mainstream, limited vocabulary that tries to appeal to as broad an audience as possible, and word choices are often generic. It aims for simple prose without many flourishes, simple sentence structure, and that's perfectly fine, if completely unremarkable. Other than that it is fairly solid, grammar is well-edited, etc. But I can't help feeling that both the author and many readers believe the novel has better prose than it actually has: even the parts that have clearly been worked on the most aren't that striking or as impactful as they try to be, in my opinion. A perfect example is the popular opening: *""It is important, when killing a nun, to ensure that you bring an army of sufficient size. For Sister Thorn of the Sweet Mercy Convent, Lano Tacsis brought two hundred men.""* It surely has an impact due to the dissonance of needing an entire army to kill a single nun, I truly understand why it's so beloved. But it is also a fair representation of the entire book: it is, all in all, simple to the limit of becoming generic in word choice and structure; it relies entirely on one ""image""; and it will get repeated at least two other times!
* \[*Plot and Pacing*\] This is the other metric where I have to judge the book harshly, though not give insufficient marks. The amount of exposition is staggering and it ruins the pacing of too many scenes to count. There are constant dialogues whose only purpose is explaining rules about the world, about the Convent, about some challenge that is about to be tackled immediately after, even about places that appear only for a brief chapter. Regarding the plot more specifically, many of the plot points and sources of conflict are really just due to misunderstandings or lack of communication, which ruined my suspension of disbelief for how arbitrary and pointless they were. Finally, regarding the mysteries and twists, I felt a bit talked down to. Most of it was extremely predictable and overexplained in such a way that even the most inattentive reader would understand everything by the end. Way too much foreshadowing for some events. That said, I didn't find egregious plot holes, it was an okay read, if one filled annoyance, fabricated conflict and predictable turns.
* \[*Characters*\] The main character is fairly standard, there isn't much to say about her. Didn't have any friends growing up because she was different, so she desperately wants to be loved. She's afraid of letting herself go because she's dangerous if she loses control, etc. There's nothing badly written about her, but she isn't groundbreakingly original in any way possible. The supporting cast is similarly uninspired but overall decently-written. Most characters are somewhat stereotypical (especially the antagonists) or clichéd in some way but no one is terribly objectionable. I would say that there are a little bit too many friends and a couple of them could be merged, but it's a minor pet peeve of mine.
* \[*Setting*\] The worldbuilding was okay. It was communicated through too much info-dumping (I already put that critique in the pacing section), but the setting itself was fairly solid. It relies a fair bit on imagery. There are some twists about the nature of the civilizations that I found somewhat intriguing. I won't write at length about the ""magic"" system because it's not a thing I particularly care about (and that shouldn't be spoiled in this case) but it is reasonably well done and original. The tone is fairly consistent. The themes are relatively shallow but not disagreeable.
* \[*Final Comments*\] I had higher expectations given the author's popularity. The world is relatively interesting but the writing style and the characters are too plain for me to continue with the series. That said, it isn't that bad of a novel.

(15) Published in the 90s: ***Sabriel*** by ***Garth Nix*** \[7.1/10\]

* \[*Oh no!*\] Another review I didn't complete in time. This one however I actively procrastinated: I have very little to say about Sabriel. I found it the quintessential novel without damning flaws nor elevating strengths. An enjoyable read, perhaps one I would have liked more as a pre-teen (but without the depth of some truly masterful children's books that have something special to say at any age). Everything from prose to characters to themes is good, but nothing truly stands out.

(16) Orcs, Trolls, Goblins: ***Legends and Lattes*** by ***Travis Baldree*** \[6.2/10\]

* \[*Plot and Pacing*\] The weakest aspect of the novel. I get that it this is supposed to be cozy fantasy, a low-stakes story providing quiet entertainment and a warm feeling but, honestly, the stakes are so low that it's truly hard to find a reason to keep reading. The book does the barest minimum to sustain its narrative. It is a collection of scenes more than a structured, cohesive narration - most of them could be deleted or swapped around without any significant change. The sense of progression is lacking, and the goals and motivations are basic.
* \[*Characters*\] The characters are fairly nice, neither spectacular nor that original. Their relationships develop so fast and so smoothly that I found it quite hard to suspend my disbelief and to consider them as people interacting with each other. They are all basic, easy to read and without particular depth. The romance is cute and the friendships are too, but it's all very surface-level without any significant emotion or event occurring.
* \[*Setting*\] The tone is so uniform that the cozyness feels washed out. Thematically, the message isn't much more than ""don't judge a person by their species"" - but even then, the story isn't really built around conveying this with any strength. It is truly ""about the vibes"". The world is barely sketched out and nothing original about it stands out anyways.
* \[*Writing Style*\] Prose and dialogue are fairly uninspired though not flawed in any major sense. The writing style and author's voice are quite anonymous.

(17) Space Opera: ***The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet*** by ***Becky Chambers*** \[6.3/10\]

* \[*Plot and Pacing*\] I didn't enjoy the plot, finding it at the same time too meandering, incohesive and predictable (quite a feat). I understand that it is supposed to be a character-driven good and cozy time but it's too much like a sitcom, a series of fairly tropey scenes that could have happened in any order without any shred of conflict, tension or sense of development. And finally, the amount of info-dumping conversations is completely unjustifiable.
* \[*Characters*\] There isn't much to say about the characters, honestly. They aren't bad but they are way too one-dimensional to carry a novel without plot on their backs. Most of them are wholesome to the point of absurdity - I even liked all of them, but they are just flat and show little, if any, development. Their backgrounds are extremely unimaginative. The main character is especially flat and used almost only as a convenient info-dumping tool - she has remarkably few conversations that actually offer some character development (one with the romance interest, and one with the cook).
* \[*Setting*\] The universe is the best thing about this novel, and what barely carries it to a passing grade. There are many little ideas that make up a fairly nice mix that manages to feel unique, alive and colorful enough despite not having the depth and obsessive preciseness of other works. There is nothing excessively groundbreaking about it and the themes are fairly simple and, honestly, a bit too repetitive, but nothing too problematic. Thematically, it's a cozy story about found-family, about embracing diversity and multiculturality, about wholesome characters having a good time and despite me enjoying all of these things quite much, it was too trite and reptetitive. I understand and share the need for stories like these in sci-fi and fantasy but this novel really could have used some degree of internal conflict about anything to convey its messages more effectively.
* \[*Writing Style*\] Little to note here. Fairly average, not bad but nothing stands out.

(18) Author of Colour: ***The Empress of Salt and Fortune*** by ***Nghi Vo*** \[6.6/10\]

* \[*Writing Style*\] Prose and dialogue are unremarkable but there isn't anything bad about them: standard vocabulary, correct grammar, plain style... There are some repetitions here and there (e.g. ""do you understand?"") that try too much to be an interesting recurring phrase, but they are not well-written enough to really cross the line between boring repetition without substance to become an artful stylistic choice.
* \[*Plot and Pacing*\] The ""past"" plotline centered around the Empress and the handmaid is fairly engaging and relatively unique despite not being particularly imaginative nor too original... But I disliked the narration mainly because the ""current"" plotline about the cleric-historian (and the fairly useless bird) was extremely generic, it detracted more to the actual plot by adding a layer of detachment, than adding anything worth mentioning in return.
* \[*Characters*\] The characters are a mixed bag. The Empress, the handmaid and the side characters from the past were worth reading about despite not being particularly groundbreaking, their relationships were relatively intricate and enjoyable. Overall, they made for an interesting short story. But as mentioned in the section about plot / narration, the characters from the present weren't interesting at all, almost a blank slate with the barest amount of characterization. The bird in particular was uninspired, a weak attempt at quippy banter without much commitment, more annoying than actually developed, more there for flavour and a semblance of worldbuilding than for any cohesive narrative choice.
* \[*Setting*\] The setting was okay, more for colour and atmosphere than for actual substance. Many of the more magical elements (e.g. the ghosts) mentioned in the present plotline were completely irrelevant for the story - which is not a justifiable choice in such a short narration. The resulting aesthetic was however nice enough to not judge this too harshly.
* \[*Final Comments*\] Honestly, this could have either been shorter and better edited to make for a more focused, more incisive, more original story; or with the addition of a couple ideas, expanding on the present plotline, make for a short novel. As it is, it is neither and cannot reach its full potential. But it is still quite enjoyable and it has a spark that could become something more.

(19) Survival: ***Dungeon Crawler Carl*** by ***Matt Dinniman*** \[5.1/10\]

* \[*Characters*\] Some characters are quite fun (especially Princess Donut), but the M.C. is a bit too plain and over-competent for my taste. They aren't terribly flat but not particularly deep either. Their arcs are very standard, there is nothing out of the expected in their trajectories.
* \[*Setting*\] The setting is somewhat amusing and entertaining but it's not that original, and it gets old quickly. The themes are agreeable but kinda stale and without much depth.
* \[*Writing Style*\] The prose is fairly decent, there's nothing to hate but also nothing that really catches the eye. The dialogue is probably slightly better, but its structure is a bit repetitive. The comedy is not for me at all, and quite childish if you can pardon a subjective and negative statement.
* \[*Plot and Pacing*\] The plot is fairly uninspired. It is quite linear: Carl and Donut face a problem (usually, an enemy), they despair, they solve it (usually, by exploding stuff), they banter until the next problem shows up. When they meet side characters, we either get further explanations about the ""rules"" of the game, or fairly simple ""moral dilemmas"" that aren't really unexpected for the situation nor worth overthinking. The repetition of it all gets boring quickly.
* \[*Final Comments*\] It's such a popular book at the moment that it doesn't need another long review: it didn't work for me and I'm not continuing the series.

(20) Judged by its cover: ***A Memory Called Empire*** by ***Arkady Martine*** \[7.5/10\]

* \[*Plot and Pacing*\] The plot is enjoyable, though it has weak points. I like the premise of the predecessor's consciousness being implanted into the protagonist but then that aspect is absent for **way** too long, and this breaks the ""promise"" between the author and the reader. Aside from that, the book feels at its strongest when the story moves towards the greater plot machinations (war, politics, etc.) rather than the murder-mystery aspect. I still don't know how to feel about the conclusion, it isn't bad or particularly weak but it could be much better, especially regarding the various characters' relationships. The pacing is a bit too uniformly fast for my taste, and oddly enough it slows down only during the ending, which should be the climax.
* \[*Characters*\] The protagonist is interesting, demonstrates enough agency, and her qualms about the positive and negative feelings she has about the empire are well-written despite not being all-consuming (mostly, she's too busy surviving the political dangers to pontificate too much). Quite a likeable character, though not a ground-breaking one. The side characters are okay but engaging, they manage to have reasonably distinct personalities and reasonable motives.
* \[*Setting*\] I expected a stronger development of the main themes (on a societal level, the interplay between the tiny culture and the almighty empire; on a personal level, discussion about what identity and memory is) but neither is really pursued too much, and this is one of the rare cases where I'm not too unhappy with it. There would've been enough space to lean more on the ethics or philosophy or whatever, but it isn't lacking in that sense either. There is more focus about the linguistic and cultural differences between the two cultures (lots of poetry and such) instead of focusing on military and economical power differences. And about political intrigue, which is always a plus. The identity discourse is more about the personal relationships than about philosophical issues, and a bit about the morality of some edge cases rather than an existential question. Overall, it was different from what I expected but not too much worse for it. The world-building isn't too expanded, but it's still fairly enojyable and it has a couple of interesting ideas. It is quite refined on the aspects it focuses on, such as the meaning of words and concepts, poetry, culture... But a lot of suspension of disbelief is required for the more practical aspects. Just go with the allegorical more than the concrete.
* \[*Writing Style*\] Good. The vocabulary is reasonably varied without being abstruse, the grammar is correct and not hyper-basic. The style does not have any strong peculiarity but I wouldn't call it plain. The dialogue is good and interesting at times, clever but not cheaply witty. There are sparks of more experimental / interesting prose in the plot-relevant poetry and when the language differences are underlined, but they are only about a dozen of occurrences of these. Some scenes are definitely more refined but the overall quality is slightly above average. The lore bits in the beginning of each chapter are a bit random but they don't do any particular harm.
* \[*Final Comments*\] Quite enjoyable. Not perfect, but I'll remember it. That said, it had more potential. Not a poor execution in any way, but I keep thinking that it could've been more. And maybe the ending was a bit of a letdown. I'll probably read the sequel which at this point isn't strictly necessary... But there are a couple of things left hanging that deserve a proper conclusion.

(21) Small town setting: ***Assassin of Reality*** by ***Marina & Sergey Dyachenko*** \[8.4/10\]

* \[*Sequel: short review*\] I rated the first book in the series (Vita Nostra) very high: \[8.9/10\]. This sequel isn't as excellent, but it's still quite strong. I really disliked the opening of this novel. The ending of Vita Nostra was quite poetic, evocative and abstract. This one stars by crashing Sasha back to the ground in a way that almost deleted her accomplishments and self-realization. But then, it manages to take the same concepts from Vita Nostra and expand them in an imaginative and poetic way once again. All while having the quality of prose and dialogue that the first book showed. The character work also proceeds steadily for Sasha - but not as well for the side characters. The mystery and atmosphere succed in remaining consistent but not static. The new characters are a mixed bag. The pilot is very lackluster but his father is quite interesting. Overall, it is a good sequel but I'm not sure it was entirely needed.

(22) 5 short stories: by ***Tatsuki Fujimoto***

* \[*Manga* ***Sayonara, Eri*** 8.2/10\] Such a good one-shot that really makes excellent use of the manga format. It is a love-letter to cinema, managing to create a wide variety of scenes with such a precise mastery of the flow of time. Some are slow, with minute differences between panels, some are dynamic. The story is very emotional despite being quite extravagant. The author definitely manages to put a ""sprinkle of fantasy"" into the story. Definitely recommended
* \[*Manga* ***Look Back*** 8.0/10\] An emotional one-shot about friendship and commitment to art. Definitely recommended.

(23) Eldritch Creatures: ***Annihilation*** by ***Jeff Vandermeer*** \[7.5/10\]

* \[*Writing Style*\] I expected better pure writing skills from what previous information I had on the author and the novel. The prose and dialogue are okay, but I didn't particularly love the style the author was going for, or his voice in general. It is somehow both detached and personal and this mix didn't work for me. The characters have no names (terrible choice, I understand the reasoning but the execution was poor) and many of the present events are related without strong emotions. But at the same time, the protagonist has vivid recollections of the past, regrets, and almost breaks the fourth wall when admitting she hasn't been entirely truthful. And yet again, despite these personal insights, she's extremely introverted and recollects them with emotions that are often difficult to relate with. I just can't suspend my disbelief nor relate too much with this constant back and forth between levels of emotions involved, detachement, recollections, present horror, objectivity vs subjectivity. I found the tone inconsistent. All of this would perhaps have worked with more striking prose, or a more experimental one, but alas it wasn't for me.
* \[*Plot and Pacing*\] Gripping plot. I was intrigued and always wanted to know more. But the pacing isn't great (especially weird for such a short novel). Too many flashbacks, they managed to communicate all the main ideas quickly and then became redundant (as flashbacks often are when not handled well).
* \[*Characters*\] Hyper focused on the main character. Fairly interesting and relatively unique, though her characterization was a bit redundant. For such a short novel, the same concepts were repeated a bit too much. Despite that, I liked her well enough, and I'd want to follow her more. The supporting cast is there just for the plot's sake (not even named for the ""atmosphere""). The eldritch being that could arguably be called ""antagonist"" is super unique and definitely the original idea that carries the novel on its back.
* \[*Setting*\] The world was very unique, creepy and with such a great atmosphere. It's the key part of the novel and the main reason to read it. It is uncanny and weird in the best of ways. I don't want to spoil it so I'll stop talking about Area X itself. The themes were also fresh and well-woven into the world and into the main character's personality / history. On a personal level, I interpreted it as a story about facing things you hide or try to ignore, about the struggle of connecting with people, about how hard it is to communicate, especially when the two people involved are so deeply different.
* \[*Final Comments*\] Honestly even after writing this review I'm still quite ambivalent about the novel. I really loved the setting, the themes. I enjoyed enough the protagonist. But the detached, unclear writing style and the issues with pacing and flashbacks truly turned me away from rating it higher.

(24) Reference Material: ***The Tyrant Baru Cormorant*** by ***Seth Dickinson*** \[8.3/10\]

* \[*Sequel*\] I gave an extremely high rating to the first (and debut!) novel in the series, The Traitor Baru Cormorant: \[9.1/10\]. It was such a well crafted book on so many levels: amazing character work, rich themes, good prose, great plot, excellent cohesion between character arcs, narrative arcs and themes. The sequel wasn't nearly as good, though still riding on the back of the first novel for the protagonist's character work (and some antagonists), world-building and prose. It had so many issues: the flashbacks were especially terrible for pacing and for tone contrast, the plot was meandering, the new antagonist was too cliché for the story, some dialogues were almost retcons. But it also added further complexity to themes and world-building, and it reinforces the morbid notes already present in book 1. Book 3 is a step up from book 2 but still inferior to the first. It has a more clear direction, it fixes most plot points left hanging, and the side character work is better. Still, one of my favourite sagas so far.

(25) Book Club (Classics): ***Elric of Melniboné*** by ***Micheal Moorcock*** \[7.1/10\]

* \[*Oh no!*\] The fourth and final review I couldn't finish in time. A fairly enjoyable classic - even if a bit outdated under some aspects. I didn't love its episodic nature, though the main character is definitely an iconic and compelling one. I'll do a proper review after moving forwards with the series, as many of the character-defining events mentioned early on are actually narrated further into the series.",4,1743479985.0,Fantasy,1,1.0,False

(Sorry for the messy English, it's not my 1st language)

About 8-9 months ago, I (19M) walked in on my then GF in bed with another guy. Needless to say, this one event (and the ensuing messy breakup) did a number on my mental health and it took me a very long time to get back to where I was. I went on a healing journey, picked up some hobbies, stayed consistent at the gym, and I tried to expand my horizons a little bit. All to make me a better person and with the goal of becoming more desirable. Don't get me wrong, I'm proud of my progress, but I was perfectly happy with the person I was before the breakup (Gym 5x a week, fluent in 3 languages, decent personality, etc.), so my main motivator behind further self improvement was finding a life partner.

Now recently, I felt ready enough to start dating again. The apps were a complete disaster. Less than 10 matches total over 2 months (I tended to swipe right on 50% of profiles), with most either never responding or being bots/scammers. I did also go out and meet people, both through my hobbies (Rugby, book club, volunteering mainly), and at bars and clubs (usually went out with my friends on Fridays). I've always struggled to talk to women (really bad social anxiety and ADHD), so I never got anywhere at clubs and bars. I was able to give good impressions but I could never keep someone's attention before they got bored or moved on to the next guy. I had a bit more luck at the food bank I volunteer at and met this wonderful girl there.

We hit it off really quickly. Turns out we share a lot of the same interests (she was also a big reader and had been interested in rugby), and she even had the same tastes as I did with both TV and books. It all really seemed too good to be true, but when we get comfortable with each other I asked her out for coffee. Things went really well, and we committed to a 2nd date. The 2nd date also went well and we started dating regularly. We really clicked and started dating regularly. I made sure to be myself, which she seemed to enjoy, and I didn't bring up anything too sexual unless the conversation prompted it. I felt like I may have finally found that happiness I was chasing with my ex, so I made plans to ask her to be exclusive on our 6th date. We made plans, and I paid for a reservation at a pretty nice restaurant. I also set up a small surprise at an overlook nearby where I'd pop the question.

I never got that far.

On the day, I texted her in the morning to make sure we were still on, and we updated each other throughout the day. Originally the plan was for me to pick her up and drive us, but she told me something came up and she'd meet me there. I guess this was the first red flag. I got to the restaurant, and I waited. I tried texting and calling, but 0 response. I waited until the restaurant called and told me they couldn't hold our reservation anymore, so I cancelled it, went home, and just cried for a very long time. I've been rejected, ghosted, and even stood up since I had started dating again but it never felt like actual betrayal before.

This was all 3 days ago and I don't think I've ever felt this lonely. At this point I've lost my motivation and only get out of bed to attend classes and get my homework done. I feel like some kind of freak, undeserving of love. I push everyone away, I did it with my ex, and now I've done it with this girl and I don't even know what I did wrong. She seemed fine earlier in the day but just dissappears later. We've met and hung out so many times. I just feel disgusted by myself. I thought I could handle failure but at this point it feels like a pattern with me as the common denominator. I feel pathetic getting this hung up over someone I wasn't even in a relationship with, and all the repressed memories from my past breakup have come rushing back.

I've started to resent dating, but there's nothing I'd hate more than to become that one guy who sits in front of his computer all day and blames women for all his misfortunes. I want to be better. I work on myself constantly in order to be someone I can take pride in, I work out 5 times a week and I'm proud of my current state. But whats the point of living this life if I've got no one to share it with? All my close friends rave about how awesome their partners are, and how great they feel as a couple, while all I could do was grin and bear it with the hopes that I would also find someone I could share that joy with, but not anymore. I'm so close to giving up and I just can't see the point of going thru all this effort when it results in nothing.

Sorry for the vent, but I'm just so frustrated, it seems that no matter what you do, something happens. Either someone funnier/better looking comes along, or they realize they're not ready for a relationship, or they find out I'm just plain ugly. I just wish I could at least know why.",1,1743479634.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I'll explain all the flavors and ways coffee is made. We'll also eat food because it is nice to have something yummy to pair with the Devils Juice. 

Then we'll go underwear shopping at your choice of stores. My personal favorites are standard drawers from the mall for women, Costco's Kirkland brand for men. We'll keep it basic to help your transition to real fabrics. 

After you get your first post-mo underwear, we'll swing by a liquor store. Even if you choose to not drink alcohol, it is good to be educated on what all the fuss is about. Just like coffees, there is endless variety in ways to get a teeny tiny bit of drunk. And we'll review the laws about intoxication so you know not to be stupid with drinking and driving, public drinking, etc. No reason for you to be a middle-age idiot about alcohol.  

We'll have a nice meal at a decent restaurant, where we'll practicing ordering coffee, tea or a glass of whatever mixed drink you want. It's important to learn how to behave in social situations. We'll finish off with dessert - tiramisu or whatever they have with coffee or alcohol in it. Even Satan deserves a bit of sweetness in life. 

Before I take you home, we'll visit a Cannibus store to get a lesson in all things natural herb. Again - no pressure to buy anything. Just an informational tour to get the lay of the land. 

Women might want to pay a bit extra for a side quest to find sleeveless clothes or two-piece bathing suits. Although, with the new garment tops, maybe the sleeveless tops won't be such a shocker in coming years. 

If the client is particularly daring, I'd be happy to accompany them to their first rated R movie in a theater. I'll coach them on ordering a proper caffeine soda at the snack bar, and I'll hold their hand during the scary sexy scenes. Everyone knows Mormons have no problem with graphic war movies, but naked boobies and wieners is just too much. 

I think this business would be a gold-mine in Utah, AZ and Idaho. How much would you pay for such a wonderful day learning all the ways of the world?

The end I just completely lost the plot cause I went on my phone once. Im 18, never really written like this besides for school. Wanted to share even if its generally shitty.","Also I should note that I do believe that asexuals exist and I know not everyone likes sex and drugs, its an exaggeration of what American culture appears to be. I wrote it in one sitting completely off the dome, it is my thoughts on this topic. That is all it is. And it definitely isn't going to be perfect. If there is typos I'm not surprised and if no one reads this im also not surprised. I just felt weird leaving it in google docs but also want no real attachment towards it, itll just stay on reddit forever.

Like I said I dont really write, this is the first time Ive expressed myself this way on my own and i kind of enjoyed it, so im a little sad there is no proper ending. you will probably get the gist if anyone reads it anyhow. It is meant to be read as if its a conversation, my vibe probably wont be translated well into writing.

anyways here it is, at 1,970 words and 3 pages single spaced. American culture.

What is American culture? People say that it doesn’t exist but I think its just too diverse and huge to really pinpoint it in a general sense. Socal culture is different from Norcal culture, New Orleans definitely has a culture, Louisiana, you get it. Even if you start to expand it a bit, we call the MidWest the Midwest for a reason, Those areas share a culture in a way. Same with the great lakes and the south. Now even then, culture differs from age groups/generations, America’s culture is evermoving forward and backwards, progressive and conservative. Again this makes it harder to pinpoint in a general sense, but also, who really cares about the culture of people past the age of 60 in America; their lives are too boring to bring in the conversation of “America’s Culture”. 

Teenagers and Twenty-year-olds are who I’m basing this definition of culture on. What is common between these people no matter the state in America? Hypersexuality and drugs are probably the easiest to name. Look at Utah, if it wasn’t for Mormonism there wouldn’t be a term called soaking. Even the super-religious folk in America want to have sex so they find new loopholes. Whether it's Catholics and their thing for anal sex so their virginity isn’t “really lost” or Christians and their love for male oral sex; I feel like they wouldn’t go down on a woman unfortunately. You’re average young churchgoer has committed adultery more times than their ancestors from 3 generations and on combined probably. Increasing porn addictions in young men and the addictions to phones dont help either cause everywhere on social media you will find something sexual because that is what we love anyways. If you like it, youre hardly ever gonna go out of your way to block it out or care when you see it. Of course there are issues with hypersexuality but that’s not the point I’m trying to make here. I love sex. Even before I watched my first porn video and got scared that the virus pop-up on my phone was real. I was a weirdly sexual kid, I didn’t know what sex was but I knew pleasure when I felt it and liked to talk/flirt to the older women who were nice to me. Religion In America can hardly stop people’s lust and now more than ever, sex talk is normal. 

The easiest way to find out what our culture is, is by viewing or consuming the art we create. Family Guy unironically pointed this out, we like seeing sex on tv. When I see those slop rom-coms, I can’t help but think, “this movie is so american, it could ONLY be made in america”. That right there shows you American Culture. “Why Him?” Its like the two different white people colliding with each other, loud roudy probably more progressive, and family oriented probably conservative. Now the movie kind of sucks, but my point really is shown throughout the movie. The mom uses the bidet for pleasure like the freak ass american she is. I didn’t finish the movie like I said it kind of sucks and is way too long. But lets look at kendrick lamar, every single album has a reference to something sexual, because that is what we like and do as young people. Tyler the creator, JpegMafia, Kanye, and the most important example, Nettspend all have written sexual lyrics. 

Whether or not you know who he is or even like him, he does have a grasp on the young audience of America. I do actually like nettspend, but he only recently had his 18th birthday and his freshman album was written at 17 (i presume as it was released before he was 18 but could also have older songs written at 16 i dont know the guy). This kid from Richmond Virginia is rapping with lyrics in involving “sluttruck” and saying “Shut up bitch it needs more spit” or “Bitch, I’m seventeen, kinda weird she likes me, but I ain’t no child, bitch”. Now again I’m a fan of Nettspend but I really think he is a perfect example of what younger people think is cool today, I think culture has always been based on what is cool. And what is truly cool now is fucking bitches and doing drugs.

Nettspend also has lyrics involving drug use, I'm not gonna quote them just believe me it shouldn't be that hard to. But everyone knows kids like to do drugs too. Juul epidemic, xan epidemic, you know them if you were there. Nicotine is a very popular drug now for younger people, I’ve seen fucking NERDS hit the geekbar after class. College has been known for this. Underage drinking and copious amounts of sex are what young people imagine a frat party to be filled with. And its not like that bar has been set for no reason, of course not everyone likes drugs or sex or partying, BUT a lot of young american experience is filled with it. Whether or not you do it, you probably have friends, or have heard about it. Culture isn’t based off what is quiet, unless the quietness overwhelms the loud. If you do nothing of course that isn’t gonna contribute to the culture unless everyone is doing nothing. If you study comp sci and engineering and stay away from what ive mentioned till later in your life then you are in a niche, a subculture if anything, a branch away from what american culture is. Unfortunately, most young americans arent disciplined until they have to be, when they realized they fucked around too much in high school and have to work construction till their back gives out. Being disciplined is not a part of american culture, even those who are disciplined dont express it, because it lacks substance and is boring.

“Good stories make bad lives” and “bad stories make good lives”. The over consumption of everything has led america to only express what is a good story, hardly ever will you watch a movie about a happy go lucky thing unless its funny or educational. And you know whats funny? Sex jokes are, sometimes, hardly, depending the age bracket. You know what I would hate to listen to? Someone rapping or singing about studying for their midterm, unless it was super poetic and indirect with its lyricism, but thats really fucking hard and as far as im aware no one has done it. Even if sonically it sounds good, itd just probably be a bore to sing along to. America’s culture has shifted due to the current expressionism shown, we want bad lives. We want to have fun. We want to feel pleasure. America has become a hedonistic culture. Even the bad lives part, its because it derives pleasure later on with it being a “good story”. It has this weird masochistic vibe to it where we are okay with doing drugs even if it harms our body. It looks cool and it gives pleasure. Thats all that matters right? I’ll probably quit later on when I’m done being young or I dont want to live long anyways.

Young Americans do not see the future optimistically. Whether youre a climate denier or not, whether you like the current administration or not, whether you have a family or not. Pollution is real and the weather has been pretty weird and there are a lot of species going extinct at a faster rate and the global temperature has risen. And there are rising geopolitical conflicts and there are still wars over land. And there is still child labor and there is still starving kids. If you have a 2 year old, can you really imagine how the world will look for them when they are 20? The peak of most cities is gone, hollywood is moving to a different state now, and homelessness/the open use of drugs are becoming wayyyyy more apparent. Its no wonder people who have the option, meaning middle class kids, love this hedonistic culture. What do we have to look for in 20 years? Ai is probably gonna start taking over jobs too now. The only things we have to look forward to is the meager hope that our relationship will last till we die, we make our parents proud till they die, we maybe leave a legacy after we die, some person speaks about us after we’re 6 feet under or cremated. Its no wonder young american culture is filled with hedonistic pleasures. We are death-obsessed and there is hardly any pleasure left after we are young, no one wants to work a 9-5 office job for the rest of their life. So we fill it with quick pleasures now, as much as we can till we cant anymore. Till we are forced to be disciplined and work for the rest of our lives to survive. Till we can’t have sex anymore cause our dicks dont work or our pussies dont get wet like they used to so we have to use lube. Till that vape collapses our lung after hitting it 500 times everyday. The reason its hard to pinpoint older generations culture is because its so fucking boring. Its too individualistic. That old feeling as a kid of sneaking into your parents liquor cabinet and taking a sip of something already opened will never exist again. It loses its spark. As does most things. How many friends do your grandparents talk to? You get me?

Thats why its okay we have these pleasures. Its okay we want to have sex. Its okay we do drugs. Its okay we want to pretend our lives are shittier than they are. Its okay to be really into god. Its okay to fall out of religion. Because most americans end up doing this shit anyway. We get that 9-5 cause its our only chance to have a casual job and maybe if the world is actually cool in 20 years we will be comfortable. We are not hopeless, we just dont think the odds are in our favor.

If you dislike how young people act this might come off as me whining or something, but most of what I say is based on personal experience. What I’ve seen. I’m still shooting for the stars, but I’ll probably be like icarus (i know it was the sun). This young culture isn’t bad or good to me, it just is. This is what we like and are okay with seeing. We have accepted that we like these things so we dont care. I like sex and i like feeling good. I like being productive and that is what a lot of older people like as well. Thats why instead of alcohol during the day, its coffee. Thats why for young people we use vapes and zyns to stimulate our brains while we focus on school. Its not that we have given up but we pretend like we have. If we’d have really given up then we’d do way more stuff than just smoke weed and drink. 

American culture in itself is a facade, we are hedonistic, we do think there is hardly a future, but we havent given up completely yet. We like sex, but to us its just sex. We like drugs, but to us its just drugs. Some of us let our vices take control of us, but there is still some who try not to. Remember when I brought up the consumption of media being a huge factor as to why our culture is the way it is? Or maybe i didnt, i dont really remember. Anyways while we are hedonistic, its only human nature

**Notes I Like/Dislike:**

* My favorite citrus-y, tart, or fruity notes are: bergamot, tart apple, mango, red currant, nectarine, sour cherry, pink pepper.
* Not so much a fan of jasmine or iris, want to minimize those if possible. Love a good turkish rose heart, lavendar, lotus flower, ylang-ylang, or orange blossom.
* Huge soft spot for darker & spicier notes - cardamom, amber, tobacco, leather, amber, bourbon, oud, coffee.
* Holy grail note is a vanilla that is dry & extract-y instead of sweet & creamy.
* Specifically, I'm really curious about fragrances that feature harder to pin down notes like **fig**, **litchi**, &/or **plum**. Also specifically interested in tea notes.



**What I'm Looking For:**

**1. A year-round, elegant formal wear** **option**

For this category I've already sampled Tom Ford's **Black Orchid** & **Terre D'Hermes.** Both are wonderful, just not quite exactly the right fit. Black Orchid has a damp licorice note coming from somewhere weighing it down too much, & the cold brightness **Terre** feels out of place on me, I think I'm looking for something darker or denser. The two fragrances I'm looking at for this hole in my collection are **BDK Parfums Gris Charnel Extrait** & **Penhaligon's Halfeti.** Does anyone have any experience with either of those, or other recommendations for formal options?



**2. Sexy, Alluring Date Night/Night Out Fragrances**

Things I've sampled in this category include: **Emporio Armani Stronger With You Intensely**, & **D&G The One For Men EDT.** SWY Intensely is a fantastic fragrance but it feels slightly too winter-y & sweet to be a year round wear for me.  The One EDT is a good, well-rounded fragrance where I like all of the notes, but it feels really muted on my skin. Nothing really stands out except the orange blossom, which does produce a creamy orange vanilla creamsicle. I wish it was bolder, & I find myself wishing I had bought the EDP version. 

For this category I'm trying to decide between **Side Effect by Initio Parfums**, **Herod by PDM**, **Tom Ford Noir Extreme Parfum,** & **Spicebomb Extreme by Viktor & Rolf**. Any other suggestions in this lane please let me know!



**Other fragrances I generally sort of like but find it hard to categorize are:** 

Tom Ford Ombre Leather, YSL La Nuit De L'Homme & YSL MYSELF EDP, D&G Light Blue Eau Intense, Polo Double Black, YSL Black Opium Over Red, Carolina Herrerra Very Good Girl, Valentino Uomo Born In Roma Green Stravaganza, Prada Luna Rossa Black, Polo Double Black",1,1743479404.0,fragrance,0,0.67,False

1jomjnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1jomjnm/how_to_advance_things_when_were_taking_things_slow/,How to advance things when we’re taking things slow,"I know everyone has different expectations/preferences in dating, but I’m looking for any potential suggestions or advice. 

I (20M) have been seeing this girl (20F) for around 3 weeks now. We both go to the same college, and are pretty busy with the semester wrapping up, so we’ve only been on 2 dates. The first was my suggestion, we grabbed coffee and had a great conversation, at the end she told me she had a great time and suggested we get dinner the next time, which is what we did a couple days ago. 

Dinner also went great, and I think we’re both interested in continuing things. At the end of the date, she mentioned she was treated badly in her last relationship, this happened as we were leaving so we didn’t have much of a conversation about it. After the date she repeated what she said, saying she had a great time and wanted to see me soon, and that I hope I understand that she wants to take things slow. I told her I did and that I also take things slow so she should try not to worry too much about it. She messaged me yesterday saying she wants to focus on studying this week and that she would reach out to me next week, so chances are we won’t see each other until next weekend. 

This has given me some time to think, and has made me question what exactly she means by taking things slow. Besides the occasional compliment, we haven’t really done anything physical or in a romantic sense, we’ve just been getting to know each other. I think up to now that’s ok, but I want her to know I am serious about continuing things with her and want to advance things. I think it doesn’t help that we’re both just nervous as hell and too have been too worried to try anything

I’m not saying I need to do everything in the book by the end of the next date, but I’m worried that she may lose interest if nothing progresses. Should I speak to her about this  and see what taking things slow means to her? Or should I just start being more affectionate and gauging her reaction? Thanks!

## Key Features Analysis

The Keyboard Case market is rapidly evolving, with manufacturers constantly innovating to improve usability and functionality. Understanding the core technical specifications is essential for making an informed purchase.

**Keyboard Layout and Key Travel:** The physical layout of the keyboard is crucial for comfortable and efficient typing. Consider the key spacing, key size, and overall arrangement.

Key travel refers to the distance a key travels when pressed. A longer key travel typically provides a more tactile and satisfying typing experience,while a shorter key travel can offer a faster response. Look for keyboard cases that offer a key travel depth of at least 1.2mm for a comfortable typing experience. The availability of dedicated function keys and media controls can also greatly enhance productivity.

**Connectivity and Battery Life:** Keyboard cases typically connect to devices via Bluetooth. Ensuring a stable and reliable Bluetooth connection is paramount to prevent dropped keystrokes or lag.

Battery life is another critical factor. Look for keyboard cases that offer long battery life, ideally lasting for several weeks or even months on a single charge. Models with rechargeable batteries are generally preferred over those that require disposable batteries, offering both convenience and cost savings. A keyboard case with an auto-sleep function that conserves power when not in use is also a plus.

**Material and Durability:** The material used in the construction of the keyboard case significantly impacts its durability and overall feel.Common materials include polycarbonate, aluminum, and synthetic leather.

Aluminum keyboard cases offer excellent durability and a premium aesthetic, while polycarbonate provides a more lightweight and budget-friendly option. The hinge mechanism that connects the keyboard to the tablet or phone holder should also be robust and well-engineered to withstand frequent opening and closing. A scratch-resistant coating can help to maintain the keyboard case's appearance over time.

**Protection and Portability:** A good keyboard case should provide sufficient protection for your tablet or smartphone, shielding it from scratches, bumps, and accidental drops.

Consider the level of protection offered by the case, paying attention to reinforced corners and edges. Simultaneously occurring, the keyboard case should be reasonably compact and lightweight to maintain portability. A bulky and heavy keyboard case can defeat the purpose of using a mobile device on the go. Look for slim and lightweight designs that do not add excessive bulk to your tablet or smartphone.

**Backlighting and Special Features:** Backlit keys can significantly improve typing accuracy in low-light conditions. Consider a keyboard case with adjustable backlight brightness levels to customize the typing experience to your preference.

Some keyboard cases also offer additional features such as a built-in stylus holder, a kickstand for convenient viewing, and programmable shortcut keys. These extra features can further enhance the overall usability and versatility of the keyboard case. Some keyboard cases even include a trackpad or touchpad, providing similar functionality to a laptop.

## Core Benefits

Keyboard cases offer a myriad of benefits for users seeking enhanced productivity and convenience with their tablets or smartphones.

**increased Typing Speed and Accuracy:** The primary benefit of a keyboard case is the ability to type faster and more accurately compared to using an on-screen keyboard. Physical keys provide tactile feedback and allow for touch typing, resulting in significantly improved typing speeds and reduced errors. This is especially beneficial for tasks such as writing emails, composing documents, and engaging in instant messaging.**Enhanced Productivity on the Go:** Keyboard cases transform tablets and smartphones into portable workstations,enabling users to accomplish tasks on the go without having to rely on a laptop or desktop computer. This is especially useful for professionals who need to stay connected and productive while traveling or working remotely. A keyboard case paired with a tablet offers a compact and lightweight choice to a laptop, allowing users to easily work from anywhere with increased efficiency.

**Improved Ergonomics and Comfort:** Typing on an on-screen keyboard for extended periods can lead to discomfort and strain in the hands and wrists.A keyboard case with a physical keyboard offers a more ergonomic typing experience, promoting better posture and reducing the risk of repetitive strain injuries. The tactile feedback of the keys allows for a more natural and comfortable typing experience, especially during long writing sessions.

**Protection for Your device:** In addition to enhancing productivity, keyboard cases also provide physical protection for your tablet or smartphone. The case acts as a shield against scratches, bumps, and accidental drops, helping to preserve the device's appearance and functionality. This is particularly significant for users who frequently travel with their devices or use them in environments where they are prone to damage.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions about keyboard cases can help consumers make informed purchasing decisions.

**are all keyboard cases universally compatible with all tablets and smartphones?**
No, keyboard cases are typically designed to be compatible with specific tablet or smartphone models. Be sure to check the product specifications to ensure that the keyboard case is compatible with your device before making a purchase. Universal keyboard cases that connect via Bluetooth are also available, but these may not offer the same level of integration and fit as model-specific cases.

**How does a keyboard case connect to my tablet or smartphone?**
Most keyboard cases connect to tablets and smartphones via Bluetooth. Simply pair the keyboard case with your device through the Bluetooth settings, and you'll be able to start typing immediately. Some keyboard cases may also connect via a physical connector, such as a Smart Connector or a USB-C port, depending on the device model.

**Can I use a keyboard case with multiple devices?**
Many keyboard cases support pairing with multiple devices, allowing you to switch between them easily. This can be particularly useful if you use both a tablet and a smartphone or if you share the keyboard case with other users. Check the product specifications to determine how many devices the keyboard case can be paired with simultaneously and how easy it is to switch between them.

**What is the average lifespan of a keyboard case before it needs replacement?**
The lifespan of a keyboard case depends on several factors, including the quality of materials, the frequency of use, and the care taken to maintain it. On average, a high-quality keyboard case can last for several years with proper use and maintenance. However, the battery life of wireless keyboard cases may degrade over time, requiring more frequent charging.

Reading all of your stories, knowing the chaos in the world today, makes me realize how lucky I am that my kid is just a freshman right now. How I can encourage him to chase his dreams and explore his passions right now. How to help him become a thoughtful, considerate and kind adult. And that the college pressure really doesn’t need to come from me too. You guys all have it, because the world is topsy turvy already. 

I hope you know, that the purpose of college is to explore as adults what you want to do in life. Your brains haven’t fully formed yet- your hormones are cray- and you feel also this pressure. But at the end of the day- the sheer fact that you are healthy, alive and striving for excellence makes me so happy.  So please go to the college you get into with open hearts and minds. 

And I hope you guys find love!  I hope you fall in love, or lust, or whatever and if your hearts are broken, to pick it up and continue. I hope you write manifestos in the mall/lawn of your college and drink coffee and pontificate the meaning of the universe with friends at 1 am and marvel at how impossible and ordinary life is all at the same time. Grow gardens of friends and explore your infinite possibilities.

But also- please practice good hygiene and do your laundry regularly. Wash on Wednesday for laundry is a good idea.  Don’t make me move in with you and start nagging.

1jomdsx,https://v.redd.it/7286g2uvz4se1,Britt Lower: Professional Actress or Collective Hallucination?,"*Evidence for ‘Professional Actress’: IMDb page, Severance S2 promo, that one tweet from 2017.*  
*Evidence for ‘Collective Hallucination’: Have you ever actually seen her in person? Has anyone?*  
*Discuss.*  
...........................................................................  
So, there's this person. Her name is Britt Lower. Apparently, some people find her... interesting enough for a dedicated online forum. Who knew? In a world teeming with complexities – geopolitical tensions, the ever-evolving landscape of breakfast cereals – the human mind, in its infinite wisdom, decides to dedicate digital space to an individual. But hey, you clicked, so who am I to judge? 

This Britt Lower, born on August 2, 1985, in the sprawling metropolis of Illinois (population: debatable), decided at some point that pretending to be other people for a living was a viable career path.Or perhaps she just stumbled into it. The specifics remain shrouded in the mists of time, much like the true purpose of the appendix. Her given name was Brittney Leigh Lower, a fact that raises the profound question: why the abbreviation? Such are the mysteries that plague our existence.

Her resume boasts a collection of roles, each presumably involving the aforementioned pretending. There was Liz in *Man Seeking Woman*, a title so straightforward it almost loops back into being avant-garde. Or maybe it’s just straightforward. Then came Tanya Sitkowsky in *Unforgettable*. Was it, though? Really? The show aired from 2011 to 2014, so the details might be a tad fuzzy for some.More recently, she graced the screen as Helly in *Severance*. Ah yes, the one where they... sever things. A truly groundbreaking concept that explores the intricate nuances of... well, severing things. So, she plays different people in different shows. Is that... acting? This is all quite perplexing.And apparently, people *like* these performances. What does that say about us as a society?

Delving into the labyrinth of her public persona, one unearths whispers of a ""dark sense of humor."" Which, in the context of Hollywood, likely translates to occasionally ordering unsweetened iced tea.Some sources suggest she is ""insightful"" and ""creative."" Or perhaps she just benefits from the collaborative efforts of writers and directors. The line between genuine brilliance and effective collaboration can often be blurry, much like the definition of ""organic"" at your local supermarket.She has also been described as possessing ""humanity"" and a ""keen sense of what is ethical."" In this industry? One might be forgiven for raising an eyebrow, or perhaps both. Is any of this real, or is it just carefully crafted PR designed to entice more viewers to click ""next episode""? The enigma endures. Next week, perhaps we can explore the migratory patterns of her spirit animal. Spoiler alert: it's probably a slightly bemused sloth.

So, if you've managed to wade through this exposition and are still contemplating joining this digital gathering, congratulations. You possess a remarkably specific area of interest. Feel free to subscribe. Or don't. The cosmos remains indifferent.Maybe this online community will become a beacon of thoughtful appreciation. Maybe it will devolve into chaos and endless speculation about her favorite brand of coffee. Only time (and the moderators, bless their tireless souls) will reveal the ultimate fate of r/TheBrittLower. Proceed with a healthy dose of skepticism.

(Sorry for the messy English, it's not my 1st language)  
  
About 8-9 months ago, I (19M) walked in on my then GF in bed with another guy. Needless to say, this one event (and the ensuing messy breakup) did a number on my mental health and it took me a very long time to get back to where I was. I went on a healing journey, picked up some hobbies, stayed consistent at the gym, and I tried to expand my horizons a little bit. All to make me a better person and with the goal of becoming more desirable. Don't get me wrong, I'm proud of my progress, but I was perfectly happy with the person I was before the breakup (Gym 5x a week, fluent in 3 languages, decent personality, etc.), so my main motivator behind further self improvement was finding a life partner. 

Now recently, I felt ready enough to start dating again. The apps were a complete disaster. Less than 10 matches total over 2 months (I tended to swipe right on 50% of profiles), with most either never responding or being bots/scammers. I did also go out and meet people, both through my hobbies (Rugby, book club, volunteering mainly), and at bars and clubs (usually went out with my friends on Fridays). I've always struggled to talk to women (really bad social anxiety and ADHD), so I never got anywhere at clubs and bars. I was able to give good impressions but I could never keep someone's attention before they got bored or moved on to the next guy. I had a bit more luck at the food bank I volunteer at and met this wonderful girl there. 

We hit it off really quickly. Turns out we share a lot of the same interests (she was also a big reader and had been interested in rugby), and she even had the same tastes as I did with both TV and books. It all really seemed too good to be true, but when we get comfortable with each other I asked her out for coffee. Things went really well, and we committed to a 2nd date. The 2nd date also went well and we started dating regularly. We really clicked and started dating regularly. I made sure to be myself, which she seemed to enjoy, and I didn't bring up anything too sexual unless the conversation prompted it. I felt like I may have finally found that happiness I was chasing with my ex, so I made plans to ask her to be exclusive on our 6th date. We made plans, and I paid for a reservation at a pretty nice restaurant. I also set up a small surprise at an overlook nearby where I'd pop the question.

I never got that far.

On the day, I texted her in the morning to make sure we were still on, and we updated each other throughout the day. Originally the plan was for me to pick her up and drive us, but she told me something came up and she'd meet me there. I guess this was the first red flag. I got to the restaurant, and I waited. I tried texting and calling, but 0 response. I waited until the restaurant called and told me they couldn't hold our reservation anymore, so I cancelled it, went home, and just cried for a very long time. I've been rejected, ghosted, and even stood up since I had started dating again but it never felt like actual betrayal before.

This was all 3 days ago and I don't think I've ever felt this lonely. At this point I've lost my motivation and only get out of bed to attend classes and get my homework done. I feel like some kind of freak, undeserving of love. I push everyone away, I did it with my ex, and now I've done it with this girl and I don't even know what I did wrong. She seemed fine earlier in the day but just dissappears later. We've met and hung out so many times. I just feel disgusted by myself. I thought I could handle failure but at this point it feels like a pattern with me as the common denominator. I feel pathetic getting this hung up over someone I wasn't even in a relationship with, and all the repressed memories from my past breakup have come rushing back.

I've started to resent dating, but there's nothing I'd hate more than to become that one guy who sits in front of his computer all day and blames women for all his misfortunes. I want to be better. I work on myself constantly in order to be someone I can take pride in, I work out 5 times a week and I'm proud of my current state. But whats the point of living this life if I've got no one to share it with? All my close friends rave about how awesome their partners are, and how great they feel as a couple, while all I could do was grin and bear it with the hopes that I would also find someone I could share that joy with, but not anymore. I'm so close to giving up and I just can't see the point of going thru all this effort when it results in nothing.

Sorry for the vent, but I'm just so frustrated, it seems that no matter what you do, something happens. Either someone funnier/better looking comes along, or they realize they're not ready for a relationship, or they find out I'm just plain ugly. I just wish I could at least know why.

It all really seemed too good to be true, but when we get comfortable with each other I asked her out for coffee. Things went really well, and we committed to a 2nd date. The 2nd date also went well and we started dating regularly. We really clicked and started dating regularly. I made sure to be myself, which she seemed to enjoy, and I didn't bring up anything too sexual unless the conversation prompted it. I felt like I may have finally found that happiness I was chasing with my ex, so I made plans to ask her to be exclusive on our 6th date. We made plans, and I paid for a reservation at a pretty nice restaurant. I also set up a small surprise at an overlook nearby where I'd pop the question.

I never got that far.

On the day, I texted her in the morning to make sure we were still on, and we updated each other throughout the day. Originally the plan was for me to pick her up and drive us, but she told me something came up and she'd meet me there. I guess this was the first red flag. I got to the restaurant, and I waited. I tried texting and calling, but 0 response. I waited until the restaurant called and told me they couldn't hold our reservation anymore, so I cancelled it, went home, and just cried for a very long time. I've been rejected, ghosted, and even stood up since I had started dating again but it never felt like actual betrayal before.

This was all 3 days ago and I don't think I've ever felt this lonely. At this point I've lost my motivation and only get out of bed to attend classes and get my homework done. I feel like some kind of freak, undeserving of love. I push everyone away, I did it with my ex, and now I've done it with this girl and I don't even know what I did wrong. She seemed fine earlier in the day but just dissappears later. We've met and hung out so many times. I just feel disgusted by myself. I thought I could handle failure but at this point it feels like a pattern with me as the common denominator. I feel pathetic getting this hung up over someone I wasn't even in a relationship with, and all the repressed memories from my past breakup have come rushing back.

I've started to resent dating, but there's nothing I'd hate more than to become that one guy who sits in front of his computer all day and blames women for all his misfortunes. I want to be better. I work on myself constantly in order to be someone I can take pride in, I work out 5 times a week and I'm proud of my current state. But whats the point of living this life if I've got no one to share it with? All my close friends rave about how awesome their partners are, and how great they feel as a couple, while all I could do was grin and bear it with the hopes that I would also find someone I could share that joy with, but not anymore. I'm so close to giving up and I just can't see the point of going thru all this effort when it results in nothing.

Sorry for the vent, but I'm just so frustrated, it seems that no matter what you do, something happens. Either someone funnier/better looking comes along, or they realize they're not ready for a relationship, or they find out I'm just plain ugly. I just wish I could at least know why.",0,1743478490.0,ForeverAlone,0,0.5,False
1jomb3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1jomb3z/mood_swings/,Mood Swings,"For context I (37F) have been on Vyvanse for about 5 months. (ADHD and Binge Eating Disorder) I tend to take it 3 days consecutively and then take a day or two off because I get incredibly irritable on it. Super short tempered with my kids and partner in particular (and I annoy myself SO MUCH). 

I have hypothyroidism and take 112mcg of levothyroxine a day. 

I’ve had medication resistant MDD, GAD, and cPTSD since 2012, but had TMS treatment a year and a half ago that seemed to really help until recently when the anxiety and mood changes came flooding back. Previously I’ve been on Prozac, Lexapro, Zoloft, and Wellbutrin, but my doc thought the Vyvanse without antidepressants could resolve some of my crossover symptoms and for the most part it’s been amazing, but the angry outbursts that come out of nowhere are affecting my relationships negatively. I do take propranolol as needed for anxiety.

It should be noted, I’ve had a hysterectomy so no cycle, and I’m not currently taking hormone replacement of any kind.

Is there something I can do to mitigate the mood swings? More protein? Coffee in the afternoon? Adding an SSRI back? I am scheduling an appointment with my psych but he’s out 3 weeks so I’m wondering what I can try in the meantime. Any help is appreciated! 

Schedule:
6:15am - wake up, take levothyroxine
7:00am - coffee w/protein shake
8:30am - 60mg Vyvanse 
1pm - snack/light lunch (usually a sandwich with meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato), Greek yogurt
2pm - Coke Zero (20oz)
4pm - get home, irritability starts (come down)
5pm - dinner 
6pm - peek overstimulation/irritable/snapping at everyone
8pm - kids in bed, shower, read, devotions, etc.
9pm - I’m in bed, relaxing
11:30pm - 1:30am finally sleep cuz insomnia. (Never know what time I’ll finally fall asleep lol)

At this point, I'm beginning to suspect that sleep is simply a farce. Turning to my side, I see my wife comfortably asleep. While I'd love to say she looks gorgeous while dreaming, honesty prevents me; her mouth is half open, and she snores like a chainsaw. I quietly tiptoe out of bed, making sure not to wake her, and head to the bathroom to freshen up. After that, I make my way downstairs to the kitchen for a cup of coffee. Gazing out the window, I’m once again greeted by that endless white void that seems to stretch into infinity. I find myself staring at it...

 

""Good morning,"" she suddenly exclaims, having crept down the stairs without me noticing, which catches me off guard.

 

""Yeah, morning,"" I reply half-heartedly. I turn around just in time to see her rubbing her eyes and stifling a yawn.

 

""Did you make enough for me too?"" she playfully asks, pointing to my coffee mug. I direct her attention to the cup I prepared for her, resting on the kitchen counter. She ambles over, picks it up, but instead of sipping it, she just gazes into it.

 

""Have we tried drowning yet?"" she asks, her tone casual.

 

""I think we gave that a go during our first year here,"" I remind her.

 

She continues to stare into her cup, then suddenly tilts her head back, allowing the scorching coffee to spill down her nose. I watch her drop to the floor with a thud, the cup vibrating as it hits the ground. It’s somewhat humorous in a twisted way before she goes still. I take another sip of my coffee, then set it down, deciding it's time to clean the house. I begin with sweeping the living room, the bathroom, the guest room, the upstairs hallway, and then the kitchen, all while making sure not to disturb her. After that, I engage in some light exercise. I take a break to read until I sense it's getting late, even though time doesn’t seem to exist in this place.

 

Eventually, I head back upstairs and collapse into bed, drifting off to sleep again. When I wake up, the fatigue lingers. I'm accustomed to it, however. I turn to my side to find my wife peacefully sleeping, still looking a tad disheveled. I remembered all the times she died; hell, I remembered all the times I've kicked the bucket trying to get out of here, wherever here is.

The good, the bad, and everything in between.


First, an introduction and my experience.

Sent packages prior to arrival. You have to pick them up from the FedEx located in the building. That FedEx opens at 9 on Monday. It is not open Sunday.


Upon arrival, as a general WoH member you have a much shorter check in queue.
Depending on the hours, as a Globalist you can check in at the VIP lounge.

My room wasn’t available until 12:30 which is to be expected so I checked my bags with the bell desk outside the entrance to the left.


Once 1PM hit I checked in, was offered all of the waters for my stay all at once vs visiting the desk each day to obtain 2.

I was assigned a room on the 16th floor - upon getting to the elevator banks I encountered…

BAD: vents were missing along the floor and looked wicked dusty.

BAD: upon getting to my floor the hallway carpet was pretty dirty. Huge chunk of a nature valley bar, dirty Q-Tip right outside the room door.
Hallway smelled kind of… lightly odd.

Good: The room was set up very comfortably. Clean. Kind of basic but had nice lighting.

Bad: no place to work from say for the coffee table.
The coffee table had what appeared to be Coca Cola stains on the leg.

Occasionally there would be whiffs of smoke, sometimes cannabis, other times cigarettes but never consistently one or the other.


Woke up with a headache and asked to be moved.

Good: The front desk wasn’t too fussy about it and pretty understanding.
They assigned me to the 20th floor which is significantly nicer.

Great: the hallway didn’t smell funny, the floor was very quiet. The room was well appointed, clean, felt luxe and there was NO odor anywhere. 

Hallways were fun, clean, luxe. 

If I was assigned this room to begin with I’d give it a 8/10.


Breakfast is offered at Hash House A Go Go.
Huge portions, delicious made to order food from a menu.

Standard diner fare but elevated quality with healthier options available.


Would I stay here again?
Yes…. As long as I get a clean odor free room like I ended up with.

I’d love to see more rooms like the one I’m in.

Would I recommend this to someone?
Not necessarily- no guarantee for a clean/odor free room.

He asked if they had recorded it correctly it was so high.

He put me down for an ultrasound at the 8 months mark for my 'excessive maternal weight gain'. I started at 135 and am now 195. I'm 5'9"", a disordered eater, a smoker and an alcoholic.

I quit smoking, vaping and drinking upon discovering I was pregnant around 6 weeks. Drinking smoking and vaping suppressed my appetite. Now i let myself eat when I want, I enjoy healthy foods but also enjoy unhealthy foods. I am the heaviest I've ever been. I'm self conscious about it, but being as kind to myself as I can all things considered.

Most of my family is supportive and says I look good pregnant. Still my grandpa who says things that are out of touch and that make you cringe has made some upsetting comments such as calling me ""chubs"". I love him but that shit hurts my feelings.

My 'excessive maternal weight gain' ultrasound revealed a 91st percentile baby, and this new doctor said ""you're not eating for two. You're eating for one plus a snack. No baby is born and is 50 pounds"" 

I passed my gestational diabetes test with no problems, my weight gain has slowed substantially. Still, I'm over it and ready for baby to be here so I can stop eating breakfast and lunch and start drinking 6 cups of coffee a day again. I don't want these comments to have that power over me... but I'm tired of this. I could use a cigarette.

around night time, my boyfriend came over and we chilled for a bit and like everything was cool till the *incident* but we resolved things and we're back to being ok. then he had to go home which sucked but such is life

after that, i just chilled and watched tv and was drawing the entire time wile occasionally scrolling through reddit

later on in the night, i just couldnt fall asleep so i decided to get a cup of coffee and smoked outside then after a bit went back inside again. it was pretty calming honestly since its been a while since i last smoked a cigarette (it has literally just been hours). after that i literally just couldnt sleep so all i did was scroll through reddit and tiktok occasionally then i decided to draw something a bit abstract but really dumb honestly because i cant think straight whenever i pull all nighters

right now, im just watching jurassic world to chill and stuff while listening to music and writing this on my laptop. i literally dont have any plans for the day besides absolutely just try to stay awake and like try not to die because my boyfriend obviously needs me im literally batman (what am i even saying?)

1jom13u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guyver/comments/1jom13u/the_last_human_3/,the last human 3,"Two days had passed and, in the morning, Alkanphel was floating in the street with his hands behind his back and his immaculate white suit billowing in the wind; the passing cars swerved to the sides as if an enormous current of water were running down the middle of the road. Meanwhile, behind him, a woman floated in a bubble a few meters above the ground.

The woman had blonde hair tied in two pigtails and wore a very revealing outfit decorated with red and blue diamonds.  
—Hey, Legolas! Can you tell me why you brought me to Metropolis? —she asked.

—You're the bait to lure Superman —replied Alkanphel, pulling out a pocket watch to check the time.

—Oh, please! You have dozens of people in Metropolis, and you bring me around the streets. If you wanted a date, you could have asked. I mean, I might have sent you to hell, but that would have been less embarrassing for you.

—You're mistaken. Why kidnap random people? Everyone who comes to challenge Superman does the same, but since you’re a criminal, I’m sure he’ll be more interested. After all, he needs people to know that he is morally superior to everyone else. Saving you is worth more than saving ordinary pedestrians.

—Sure —replied Harley, popping a bubble with chewing gum—. Keep saying that; you’ll surely convince someone. By the way, why are you staring at that watch so much? I mean, why use one when you know there are phones that tell the time?

—I've always liked using these kinds of gadgets; ever since I first got one, I've found them very amusing —said Alkanphel as he put away his watch and looked up at the sky—. It seems I arrived very early; perhaps it would have been better to arrive at noon.

—You should enjoy the day, because when the great blue boy arrives they’ll kick your ass —said Harley, taking out her phone and pressing it against the bubble in which she floated—. At least, can you get me out of this thing? There's no internet signal here.

—If I let you go, you'll start running and jumping like a monkey, so no —replied Alkanphel, still gazing at the sky, just as a group of police officers arrived, aiming their weapons at him and ordering him to descend for causing a disturbance in public.

—Are all the people on this planet stupid? —he asked aloud, incredulous at the police using chemical propulsion weapons.

Alkanphel’s eyes flashed, and in an instant, the weapons fell to the ground, cleanly cut in half; the officers, knocked down, hurried back to their patrol cars to escape the scene.

—Do you think so highly of yourself, huh? Don’t you think that hurts you, since your behavior reflects the typical case of parental abandonment.

—I suppose I have no choice but to wait for Superman to return to the city.

—So, will you let me go? —asked Harley, emitting squeals like a spoiled child—, or will you start killing the police to bring Superman faster?

—No, what I'll do is go have a coffee, maybe eat a slice of cake, to give Superman time to return.

—Can I have one too?

—Sure, why not? I had planned to start the fight now, but I guess I'll wait a bit.

Then a shadow covered them: three people were floating. There was a girl wearing a pleated miniskirt with Superman’s emblem on her chest, a woman in a white swimsuit with a deep neckline and red cape, and a man in armor, also sporting Superman’s emblem, holding a large hammer.

Alkanphel approached and, calmly, said while placing his hands in his pants’ pockets:  
—Good morning. Can you tell me if you’ve seen Superman anywhere?  
He pulled out his pocket watch upon noticing it was barely 10 in the morning and added:  
—We had a date today, and he hasn’t shown up.

The girl replied that Superman was in the Middle East; apparently, a huge monster had appeared there and the League was taking care of it.  
—See? This is the problem with this world —said Alkanphel, turning to look at Harley—. Everyone does what they want without any consideration.  
He looked at the three present and commented:  
—I had planned to kill Superman by now, but it seems common sense isn’t one of his powers.

—Cut the games! Superman told me about you: you came and we’re going to arrest you —exclaimed Supergirl, launching herself at Alkanphel ready to strike him. However, when she was just centimeters away, she vanished; the world tipped over and crashed into a building. Supergirl flew off to reach Steel and Power Girl.

—I’ll guess: she’s Superman’s cousin, his stag. And —he looked at Power Girl—, I won’t even try.

—What does that mean? —yelled Power Girl.

—He’s calling you a bitch —said Harley with a big smile.

—In fact, I was going to use the word “backbencher,” but since you said it —replied Alkanphel.

Power Girl lunged in a blink at Alkanphel, but was halted by tiny, dazzling spheres of light like motes of dust. Steel, flying and gripping his hammer, added:  
—I know you’re not leaving —while watching Alkanphel—. I’ve seen that look before in many men. It would be an insult to your master if you were to escape now.

—Superman is not my master. We’re friends.

—That’s what you say; I bet he holds you in very high regard, but you seem to adore him. He can call you his friend and consider you as such, but you know it isn’t true. He lets you use his family’s shield, and I’m sure you won’t stop fighting, right?

Steel charged at Alkanphel; the head of his hammer emitted a blue flame that propelled him at great speed toward Alkanphel’s head. The hammer pierced through without difficulty, yet Alkanphel remained unaffected. As Steel spun, he caught a glimpse of Supergirl flying toward him to apprehend him.

Alkanphel hurled Power Girl at both of them, making them fall to the ground.

—Well, that was interesting, but we should stop. Consider this a warning: I’m coming for Superman, but if any of you dare mock me again, I’ll kill you on the spot. Get out now.

Just as he finished speaking, a red stain covered him: it was Plasticman, who had been waiting for this moment to attack. He simply pierced through Alkanphel’s body and, upon falling, a force field enveloped him, compressing him to the size of a golf ball. Still, he managed to insult Alkanphel, comparing him to Martian Manhunter.

Superman finally arrived in the city and, with a thundering voice, ordered:  
—Let him go now!  
Alkanphel maintained his calm expression, with a slight smile.

—No —he replied, placing Harley and Plasticman in front of him—. Let’s start this game: if you had been on time, it would have been easier; and if these idiots hadn’t shown up, there wouldn’t have been any problem. So I give you a choice: only one must die. If you don’t choose or try to save both, they will both die.

This infuriated Superman, who exclaimed:  
—Only one has to die, you say? Then kill me.

Alkanphel released both and began clapping:  
—Bravo, it’s the worst decision you could have made.  
Before they hit the ground, Harley and Plasticman exploded in a shower of blood, scattering organs and bones that stained the street.

Superman’s eyes widened in astonishment:  
—Monster, you said only one had to…  
—I told you to choose between them; if you tried to save both, I’d kill them both —replied Alkanphel, shrugging and drawing near Superman—. I’m not one of those fools you face for a week and then they help you save the world. I’m neither your enemy nor your ally; I’m your executioner.

Superman unleashed heat rays from his eyes with such force that the surrounding air heated up; Supergirl and the others could feel the heat from several meters away. However, the burst of red light dissipated in front of Alkanphel, as if colliding with an invisible wall; suddenly, the light reappeared, piercing a nearby building and creating a hole in its side. Flames burst through the windows as people fled: some climbed to the roof, others exited through the doors, and the most desperate leaped out of the windows.

Superman could hear the screams of dozens of people, but before he could head to the building to rescue them, he heard someone shout:  
—They’re portals —exclaimed Supergirl—; he’s using them so that you can’t hurt him.

The trio of heroes exited the building to evacuate people, while Alkanphel noticed a red stain inside absorbing as many as it could.

With astounding speed, Superman reappeared behind Alkanphel, generating a roar, but before he could strike, a shield enveloped Alkanphel. The impact of Superman’s punch was so powerful that the shockwave shattered the windows of nearby buildings. Alkanphel, still clutching his watch, maintained his unchanged expression.

Superman’s blows came so rapidly they seemed like a chain of explosions, while the sky darkened with dense, black storm clouds. The heroes charged at Alkanphel with all their might when a huge lightning bolt, as wide as a car, crashed down, splitting a building and leaving an enormous scar on its side. The steel melted, glass shattered, and fragments fell like a rain of red shards mixed with chunks of concrete.

He fired twice more at a building; the steel on one side melted and bent, causing the structure to sway. Inside, amidst the flames, screams could be heard as smoke poured from the windows.

—Coward! —yelled Superman—. You say you came to kill me; then why harm defenseless people?

Alkanphel fell silent, staring at Superman. He pointed to a building on his right and another lightning bolt fell; but before he could strike, Superman halted the bolt.  
—You still don’t understand anything —said Alkanphel—. This is your fault. I warned you that I would come for you this day and kill you. You could have been on time and evacuated the city to avoid casualties, but you didn’t. Your arrogance, combined with your stupidity, is condemning these people.

A barrage of lightning bolts began to fall, and with each one, Superman lost his breath. On several occasions, his vision faltered; he suffered burns on his right arm and moved more slowly until one bolt struck a building. It was then that Alkanphel noticed more heroes arriving, beginning to evacuate people from every building.

One of them, dressed in a black and green suit, used energy constructs to rescue people and had covered the last building when Superman could no longer keep up.

—As you see, I’m no fool. I assumed you’d try something like this, but I needed time for the League to arrive —said Superman, pausing as he saw Alkanphel gazing at the darkened sky with an expression of complete boredom—. Are you insane? Do you think this is a game?

—Are you used to having your enemies listen when you start talking? But since you chose to use your underlings, I’ll have to remove them from the scene.

The atmosphere darkened, except for the flames from the buildings and the lights of the attacks. Superman lunged at Alkanphel when a strange distortion in the surroundings enveloped him and halted him; the sound was blocked, and he found himself in a dark, heatless place. Suddenly, a violent wave of pressure swept over his body as if he were bound by a rope. The rest of his body suffered reverse pressure that made him bleed as his skin tore; one of his ears was muffled and the other began to bleed, while his eyes endured so much pressure that he felt they were about to burst.

The pain lasted only a few seconds. Superman collapsed to the ground while Green Lantern attacked Alkanphel with a massive energy punch. The collision between Alkanphel’s shield and Green Lantern’s punch caused both to momentarily vanish.

—He has no shields left, finish him off! —ordered Supergirl.

With utmost care not to be diverted by the portals, everyone charged at Alkanphel. He evaded the League’s attacks. When the area was illuminated again, enormous fire holes appeared in the clouds and columns of flames rained down across the city. As the first impacts struck, the buildings were pierced and riddled with colossal projectiles.

—What did you do? —asked Green Lantern.

—They are mere tungsten rods launched from orbit —shouted Alkanphel to the League—. You have exactly 30 seconds to intercept them, or everyone dies.

From the ground, voices cried out for anyone who could intercept the rods before they struck the city. Taking advantage of that moment, Alkanphel, now transformed into a mass of golden light, charged at Superman, stomping on the hero’s face until it sank into the street. The shoe and the leg of his pants exploded upon impact, while the members of the League who couldn’t fly closed in.

—Just to clarify: this is happening all over the world. 1.2 billion tungsten rods have been launched at major cities. Fly, you have people to save! —mocked Alkanphel as he looked at the heroes.

Superman punched Alkanphel in the stomach, sending him flying into the air.  
—Get lost! I’ll handle this braggart —he exclaimed.

Supergirl stopped Superman, warning him not to fall for such an obvious lie.  
—Can’t you hear them? —asked Superman.

Supergirl focused for a moment and flew off as fast as she could. The rest of the League vanished into the air, transported wherever they were needed.

—You still have quite a bit of strength —said Alkanphel, who was flying over Superman while unbuttoning his jacket—. Well, it doesn’t matter; before we continue, where did you get that costume of yours? Do you think someone could make me a suit? It really bothers me that normal fabric tears so easily.

Superman rose to face Alkanphel.  
—Why are you doing this? —he asked, furious, his fists trembling and his jaw clenched, as explosions echoed throughout the city.

—Because, if I hadn’t done it, you would have escaped and all your underlings would have surrounded me. —At that moment, Alkanphel threw his jacket to the ground and, from one of the buildings, something leaped and wrapped around his chest, holding his arms. It was Plasticman.  
—Weren’t you dead? —asked Alkanphel, surprised.

—It hurt a lot; luckily, Harley had enough blood to cover me —replied Plasticman, looking at Superman and urging him to hit Alkanphel while holding him. But before Superman could approach, Alkanphel emitted an intense golden light that enveloped his body, illuminating the entire area and generating so much heat that nearby glass melted.

When, at last, Superman could see clearly, Plasticman was falling to pieces, cut into several chunks by the heat. Superman tried to gather the fragments, but they incinerated in mid-air. Ash slipped through Superman’s fingers as his fists cracked from clenching tightly, while Alkanphel, still shrouded in golden light, watched him; his features became slightly more pronounced and a smile appeared on his face.

Alkanphel shot forward, as fast as lightning, toward Superman, creating a crater in the street where he landed. The shockwave sent Superman flying backward and, in the crater, Alkanphel’s silhouette could barely be seen, leaving a brilliant trail in the golden light. Superman opened his eyes to fire at him and moved forward; his radiant body left a vaporous trail that faded after a few meters.

Superman tried to punch Alkanphel in the chest, but his fist sank into the air just before reaching him. At the same time, he felt a blow on his side that sent him crashing onto the street. When he tried to get up, he could only lift his face to see several black spheres falling like a rain of stones that lacerated his skin.

Alkanphel paused for a moment, with both hands pointing toward the sky, then lowered them and crossed his arms. Dozens of lightning bolts fell one upon another, forming a tower of light in the middle of the city. Superman drove through those bolts and struck Alkanphel in the face with all his might; again and again he pounded him, forcing him back to drive him out of the city. Between blows, he shouted:  
—Monster! Assassin! Coward!  
With the final blow, he threw Alkanphel against a building. Superman accelerated even more, becoming a blue blur in the air, and delivered another blow with all his strength to Alkanphel, who was amidst a cloud of dust and rubble.

—Brat! —exclaimed Alkanphel, as an enormous golden hand halted Superman’s punch. From the cloud of debris emerged a humanoid figure, almost twice as tall as Superman. Its gigantic hand enveloped Superman’s fist with such force that he could not move.  
—Spoiled and arrogant because of your power —the being pronounced.

Superman recognized in him the same grimace, the features of Alkanphel, the straight nose, and those golden eyes with vertical pupils. Although his body still shone, a humanoid silhouette was discernible: his feather-like hair stood as if he had several wings on his head; on his forehead, a huge black crystal gleamed; on his shoulders, forearms, and thighs, hair stood on end. His chest boasted four crystals and his abdomen two more; additionally, other small crystals, resembling red pearls, were scattered over his body, glowing with a power unknown to Superman.

Superman received a punch so forceful in the stomach that he began foaming at the mouth. He attempted to counter with a kick, but it was stopped mid-air in front of Alkanphel, who immediately vanished along with Superman’s leg and reappeared to the right, grabbing him by the neck.  
—You’re one hell of a resilient thing! —commented Alkanphel, as his expression changed and the crystal on his forehead shone with golden light. The pain Superman felt was excruciating, and his scream was heard in several nearby buildings.

There stood Alkanphel, enormous, holding Superman with one fist while, in the other hand, displaying the hero’s severed leg. The blood flowed with less force than expected. Suddenly, a powerful blast of ice enveloped Alkanphel, distracting him for a moment—a moment that Superman took to break free. Glancing at his leg, he saw that Alkanphel had cleanly cut it just below the knee.

—Yes, very good, isn’t it? —remarked Alkanphel, tossing Superman’s leg over his shoulder as if it were a garbage bag. —I investigated you, and until now no one had cut off one of your limbs; it’s unusual, considering those types with magical swords and such.  
With a completely serious expression, he continued:  
—I admit I had to weaken you first for this to work. For that, I used the documents I gave you; I had to keep you busy while I took care of blocking the sun.

—Clouds don’t stop me from absorbing sunlight; in fact, if they could, I’d fly straight to the sun and… —began Superman in reply.

—And you’d leave me alone with all these innocent people to entertain myself while you weren’t around —interrupted Alkanphel, making a gesture with his hand that vanished. Superman realized he had just passed through another portal, felt his arm being tugged, and, just an instant before Alkanphel cut off his arm, they pulled him aside.

—Right now, you’re much weaker; not only because you’re injured, but because you can’t recharge your energy. That’s the key: to prevent you from recharging while you suffer significant damage —explained Alkanphel with a shrug. Meanwhile, Superman flew upward, beyond the cloud cover.

Superman took a deep breath and exhaled with all his might, creating a huge hole in the storm clouds. The sunlight reached him, but he didn’t feel better; the radiation was weaker than normal. Down in the city, Alkanphel had begun shooting at buildings still occupied by people. Screams inundated Superman’s ears, and amid the chaos, a voice was heard:

—Superman, don’t worry, fly! I’ll stay here.

Superman looked down and noticed Alkanphel’s smile. Hearing some screams abruptly silenced, he crashed like a meteorite into Alkanphel.

Transformed into a ball of fire, Superman prepared his one remaining punch to deliver a decisive blow to Alkanphel, who, raising his hands in a defensive posture, seemed to be on guard. However, his movements—likely faster than any human’s—appeared to Superman in slow motion, who accelerated even more. Before he knew it, he was in front of Alkanphel; his punch pierced the villain’s chin, yet Alkanphel’s expression did not change. By inertia, Superman continued through Alkanphel’s body, convinced he had used some density-shifting power to avoid the blow.

He spun around as fast as he could and, in his confusion, Alkanphel grabbed him by the neck.  
—Did you think it was the clouds that prevented you from recharging? —he asked with amusement, showing his fist whose knuckles glowed with a silvery radiance and left trails of distortion in the air—.  
He punched Superman in the face, sending him to the ground where he remained immobilized in a crater.

—The reason you couldn’t recharge —said Alkanphel, grabbing Superman’s hair to bring his face closer— was because I prevented it. The nuclear bombs weren’t stolen just to get your attention; I placed them in a set of asteroids that I moved between Earth and the Sun, at a precise point, so that when they exploded, they would form a cloud of dust and debris that blocked most of the sunlight that day.

Superman fired at Alkanphel with his heat vision and tried to fly away, but found the villain immobile, absorbing the shot without flinching. Looking around, he noticed that he was no longer on the ground but suspended in mid-air, surrounded by fragments of his own body: parts of his chest, his shoulders, his leg. A macabre dome had been formed from the pieces—a display of power.

—Yes, it was difficult —commented Alkanphel from behind, to prevent further attacks—, but it’s over now. With a single order, all the portals closed, cutting Superman’s body into dozens of pieces that fell to the ground.  
Superman’s death cry was little more than an exhalation that died in the air. Alkanphel stood still for a moment, watching the fragments of the extraterrestrial, and thought that if he had attacked him head-on, without hesitation and without studying him, he surely would have been humiliated in seconds.

A voice was heard behind him:  
—Cheater, cheater, no one can defeat Superman.  
A small being, dressed in a suit with a purple bowler hat and a black tie, with little hair on the sides and bald on top, said:  
—Cheater, you couldn’t kill Superman like that. He’s faster than infinity; he can even withstand solar explosions. Only kryptonite or magic can hurt him, and you didn’t use either.

Alkanphel observed the being, who accused him of cheating with a frowning yet excited expression, like a child who had just been shown a new game.

—Well, you saw it: he won, and it was very fair —commented the same being who had brought Alkanphel to this strange world.

—He didn’t win; don’t celebrate victory so soon —added the suited being—. Soon, Superman will be brought back to life; in the Fortress of Solitude, the Kryptonians have advanced machines to restore him.

—Do they do this all the time? —asked Alkanphel to the other being.

—I’m afraid so. Whenever one is defeated, his friends rewrite reality—either so he isn’t their hero anymore, so that he becomes a robot or an inferior substitute, or even to make it seem that nothing ever happened— replied the being in a disappointed tone.

—That doesn’t matter. In a month, Superman will be back, and this time you won’t be able to handle him, because he will have you at his measure.

—And in a week, Batman will devise a plan to finish you off, you’ll see —added a third little imp, comically dressed as a miniature Batman.

—And, assuming they kill you again, will they repeat this all over? —inquired Alkanphel.

—Unfortunately, yes —answered the being, explaining that the reason these heroes have survived so much is that, from time to time, their allies rewrite reality, causing some events never to occur and others to unfold differently.

Finally, amid the chaos, a voice declared:  
If someone is beating up Superman, that fool snaps his fingers and, magically, Superman becomes dozens of times stronger, finishing off the villain. The reason you were able to kill him, in addition to your plan, is that I halted Mr. Mxyzptlk’s intervention; otherwise, you wouldn’t have been able to hurt Superman.",1,1743477524.0,Guyver,0,1.0,False

1joluua,https://www.reddit.com/r/endometriosis/comments/1joluua/might_have_thoracic_endo/,Might have thoracic endo?,"Hi! I've been having chronic unexplained chest pains since I was probably 16, I'm 30 now. I'm high suspicion for pelvic endo. Wondering if some other people out there have had a similar experience to me. 

I just learned about a year ago that thoracic endo is a thing. I never in a million years would have put two and two together that my symptoms were cyclic before that. I've been more consistently tracking over the past few months, and the pain is mostly cyclic around ovulation and my period, but not 100%. But then again my pelvic endo pain is not 100% cyclic either. 

I've always described the chest pain as a sharp ache radiating from my sternum. It will get way worse when I lay down. I'll take a deep breath and the pain is SO sharp. I never thought of it as being short of breath exactly, which I know a lot of others with this condition experience, but maybe that would be the best way to describe it. I was diagnosed with costochondritis around age 18 but it has not fully gone away. I've been told many times it's heart burn but I'm positive it's not that! Years later I started getting a sharp pain on the left side of my chest also (I guess over my heart?). 

I also have had this intense left side ""shoulder knot"" where my neck meets my shoulder since about age 16. The shoulder pain can be so debilitating that I can't work. It's a sharp, tight stabbing pain. 

Something else that makes me think it's endo related is that coffee is a trigger for my pelvic pain, and also triggers chest pain. There was a time a few years ago that I was drinking coffee and I couldn't breathe, it was so strange. Around that time I actually ended up at the hospital because the pain and shortness of breath became so bad, and then it felt like someone was stepping on my throat, like I had a spasm or something. They didn't find anything wrong. That time I remember was right before my period. 

Also I can't find anything about this online, but I've found that microwaved food triggers my chest pain. And if you're wondering if that's due to being an unhealthy microwave meal, no it's not that. I eat a specific diet of the same foods all the time now and it doesn't matter what it is. Can be reheating liquids also. I know I've probably lost people here lol but I swear it happens. 

I'm scheduled for endo excision surgery in a month, but only for the pelvic region. He will look at my diaphragm and take pictures but won't remove it because they're saying there's a risk of infection, so I need another surgery if they do find it. Just wanted to see if what I'm experiencing is similar to others. ",1,1743476952.0,endometriosis,0,1.0,False

1jolsdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1jolsdp/ma_10weeks_in/,MA 10weeks in 🇵🇭,"My Abortion Experience in the Phil. (10wks)

Finding legitimate and reliable sellers for abortion medication in the Philippines is rare, but I was fortunate to come across one. At first, I had doubts, but they patiently assured me, provided guidance, and gave me all the necessary advice throughout the preparation and procedures.

Discovery and Decision

On March 1,  I confirmed my pregnancy through an HCG blood test. That week, I started searching online for options and came across a seller. To assure me of their legitimacy, they added me to various group chats where I could observe feedback and results from other clients. Many of them vouched for the service, some using private or throwaway accounts. I also learned that the seller herself had used the same medication, and the founder of the service was active in the group chat, addressing everyone’s concerns.

After monitoring the group chat for a while, I decided to proceed. On March 17, I officially placed my order, filling out a form and preparing myself for the process. Since I was in Mindanao, the package was expected to arrive in seven days.

Preparation Phase

The seller provided me with a list of preparations to follow for 10-14 days to help my body be in the best condition for the process. This included:
- Regular exercise
- Drinking pineapple juice daily
- Consuming ginger tea and coffee
- Following a specific diet
- Using primrose oil to soften the cervix

However, I was already experiencing severe morning sickness, constant vomiting, and heightened sensitivity to smells. Because of this, I was unable to fully commit to the preparation steps. The only thing I managed to do was drink one can of pineapple juice since I craved it.

The Medication Arrival & Process

On March 24, my package arrived in a small, discreet accessory box. I confirmed with the seller that everything was included.

On March 25, I asked when I could start the process. Since I believed I was already around 10 weeks pregnant, I was panicking. The seller asked if I had followed the 10-14 day preparation properly. Although I had not done so, I lied and said I started on March 20. Thankfully, I had read that the preparation was not strictly necessary and decided to trust my body.

With a set date for the procedure, I spent the remaining days resting and preparing myself mentally and physically.

The Abortion Process

On March 30, I fasted the entire day, only drinking water and pineapple juice. The seller provided detailed step-by-step instructions, infographics, and guidance for the procedure.

- 5:07 PM:Took the first dose of Mifepristone and waited 30 minutes.
- 5:37 PM: Took Ibuprofen for pain management, then the remaining Mifepristone. Placed Misoprostol under my tongue and inserted additional Misoprostol vaginally while elevating my legs.
- 6:10 PM: Swallowed the dissolved Misoprostol and continued to keep my legs elevated.

Shortly after, I began experiencing side effects:
- 7:08 PM: Itching in my hands, legs, and feet (a normal allergic reaction).
- 7:40 PM:Mild cramps started but were tolerable.
- 9:00 - 9:49 PM: Intense cramps began, so painful that I started crying.
- 10:03 PM:Light bleeding started; I changed my napkin and laid back down.
- 11:00 PM: Heavier bleeding began. Feeling weak from fasting, I drank pineapple juice to gain some energy.
- 11:26 PM: I stand up amd a little walk in my room, Passed a large clot onto my napkin, sent a photo to the seller for confirmation for sac and embryo.

The seller confirmed it was part of the process.

I went to wash myself with warm water, but as I was about to leave the bathroom, I felt another strong urge. Rushing back, I passed the placenta onto the floor.

At that moment, I experienced a mix of emotions—relief, sadness, and exhaustion. My partner was by my side the entire time, providing me with emotional and physical support. Together, we buried the embryo, closing this chapter with respect and care.

I still experience bleeding till now but not that intense. Had to take ibuprofens since my lower back is pain as hell right now. Will expect this to last till the bleeding is gone.

Abortion is a deeply personal decision, and no one should feel ashamed for making the choice that is best for them. If you are in the Philippines and considering this option, here are some key takeaways from my experience:

1. Find a legitimate and trustworthy source – Research well, join private groups, and check verified reviews. Scammers exist, so be cautious.

2. Listen to your body– While preparation steps may be helpful, do what you can and don’t push yourself too hard.

3. Have a support system– Whether it's a partner, a friend, or an online community, emotional and physical support is invaluable.

4. Follow the instructions carefully– Take the medications as directed and ensure you’re in a safe, private space during the process.

5. Stay strong and prioritize your well-being – You are not alone, and many others have gone through this too. Healing, both physically and emotionally, takes time, so be kind to yourself.

If you are unsure or need guidance, consider reaching out to safe and legitimate organizations that provide reproductive health support.

To anyone reading this who may be in the same situation: You are strong. You are capable. You are not alone. Whatever decision you make, it is valid, and your well-being matters above all else.

The first venue we saw is nice from the outside  and the inside. It can accommodates our number of guests also. The only con is that the catering food cost and reception bar is a little pricy for our budget.

The second venue is in an industrial area but when you enter inside it is very beautiful. Also the food cost is better than the first one. The con is that because it’s a lunch reception the reception is not included and we have to provide our own bartender and booze.

I’d claim my little area and get in the zone. Naturally, after a while, nature calls. Since I was a regular and both the staff and other regulars knew me, I felt comfortable leaving my stuff for a minute or so. This was Manhattan, and most of my “table guards” ranged from frail old men to socially awkward people. I never really expected anyone to physically protect my belongings if someone bold enough to walk in to a Starbucks and snatch a random MacBook came through: I always understood the risk of walking away from thousands of dollars in hardware and property. A familiar environment and the urge to urinate make you dumb.

All that to say, I recently stumbled upon a device that essentially bolts your laptop to the table. I’m sure there are plenty of variations, but it raised a question for me.

Working in cafés is already a debated topic, but what are your thoughts on bolting down a laptop so you can relieve yourself in peace? What would be your genuine initial reaction upon seeing someone with such a contraption? (Criticisms of all sorts are welcome.)

What should I do? (4) Would admissions committees expect more research accolades or a more mature profile from someone who has taken an extra year, or is the timing less significant?

I must also apologize to whoever gave me my prompt as I completed this 8 days late. I severely underestimated how long it would take to go from my outline to finished story, which caused the delay.

This story is also a surprise ficnapping. After planning everything out I realized if it would make a lot of sense if some of these characters were actually minor character made by u/Acceptable_Egg5560 and u/TheManwithaNoPlan. I asked Egg for permission and he gave the go-ahead.

Without further ado, here is my contribution to the MCP.

# Prompt:

    Several years after the war comes to a close (can be canon or any au if you wish so) the galaxy has changed in many ways for the better or worse, while some are trying to recover what was lost the humans are now making their presence in space known more, even more after BoE and many refugees were sent to human-allied species, and so after a while a small documentary crew mostly made out of non-humans sets out to see how humanity has settled in many new worlds were they are now a pressesance in studying their living conditions be it in VP (Skalga), The Cradle, Coila, Leirn, Wriss, etc.
    How are their living conditions? How are they treated?, are they “safe” in their new home?, do they have it easier in some places than in others?

**Memory Transcription Subject: Anladowsky, Harchen Film Editor**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: October 17th, 2153*

I was trying to turn off the AI interpolation for higher frame-rates while the computer ran a diagnostic on the 1.2% slower-than-expected ping frequency and the thermostats on my overclocked GPU were at acceptable levels but not below ideal levels, yet the multicolored LED backlights for my custom computer-case kept changing and ruining my bedroom’s temperature so first I had to-

“Son.” Ma’s voice snapped me out of my work. I turned my snout at her to focus with both eyes. “Are you almost done... setting up?” she asked me with a paw gesture at my desk.

“Almost. I just need to,” *-open BIOS and adjust the overclock degree-* “fix a few more things.”

“Well, the video will start after then next commercial end and I think it looks fine now.”

I focused my eyes on the large computer monitor I brought back home from college. It was displaying the live-stream of my employer’s TV channel and the quality was… actually pretty good, considering we were in a cabin in the middle of nowhere that only had a wired connection because Da personally installed fiber-optic cables for my 10th birthday.

I gave up my adjustments and joined Ma sitting on my bed. My old bedroom was just as I left it: blackout curtains on the bay window, my PC set covering up a quarter of the hardwood floors, a cabinet built from a felled tree overflowing with salvaged motherboards.

Ma look at me with one eye and asked, “Is everything okay, son?”

I sighed deeply and leaned forward. “Can you rub your claws on my back, like when I was a kid. Thanks Ma. I just want everything to be the best I could do for Pa.” I clutched and opened my paws a few times. “I got this job right after graduation and its my big break, but he just doesn’t get it.” Before she could correct me I added. “I know he supports me, and he know what this opportunity means for my career, but he doesn’t *get* it. He doesn’t watch a video and see the cuts, or the camera angles. Scene lighting, shot composition, blocking, none of it!” I dropped my paws on the bed. “He just see a video, and none of the soul.”

Ma’s claws traced my spine, scratching an itch every Harchen needs another to scratch. I continued, “I just want this to be perfect. That he could see that I really tried and put everything I had into it. I put so much into this project and could spend hours talking about all the nuances, but what if he just doesn’t see it.” I felt a tear on my check. “I just want him to feel like I do.”

""He does, he really does. Just about different topics than you.""

""I know Ma. That's probably what makes it hurt most.""

I hear the faint click-clack of clawfalls in the hallway. I focused and changed from a saddeningly deep turquoise to a joyfully neon pink. Pa burst through the door carrying a family-sized bowl, his scales a solid light blue. Ma may be fooled into thinking he was excited, but I could tell the colors were too uniform to be subconscious. “Snacks are finally all ready! Don’t know why humans insist on selling their best movie-food with shells attached.” Pa joined us on the bed, sitting on my other side. He put the bowl of pistachios on my lap, but slightly closer to himself than Ma.

“Quiet! Ma, the lights!”

The last commercial ended right as our time slot rolled in. First there was silence, then a short parental advisory and trigger warning were shown. After a few seconds, the recording production commissioned a local band to make of a [classical human song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5d7EbtLb8ok) started, and the opening I spent the last half cycle editing together for an underfunded documentary series rolled.

>Human: Hello  
Yotul: Hello  
Krakotl: Hello

The speaker changed with each word. First a human, then a Yotul, finally a Krakotl. At the same time I displayed historic footage of Governor Tarva standing in front of two humans in space suits; the moment she announced to Venlil Prime their newest allies.

When the drums came in the title card of the series held for a bar: “Everything You Touch, You Change”. The rock beat continued for several more bars with other instruments coming in, so I cut the credits in time to the music. This part lasted a bit longer than the original song to accommodate the main credits, but eventually the human started sing the first verse:

>Human: Build a ship, sent it off, we wanted to walk the stars

Three images flashed of humanity discovering FTL, building the Odyssey, and its launch.

>Human: Scared some friends, smoothed it out, the brave Venlil then risk it all

Next was a photo of Advisor Cheln passed out before the humans, Noah hugging Tarva as she cried, and her repaying the act by scaring off the Gojid fleet.

>Human: Exchange program, building bonds, but then a war rears its head

A human woman giving a class to UN troops on controlling their instincts, some tender moments from Beta Station, and then the Gojid craft carrying Marcel Fraser. As the music carried on without lyrics for a few moments, I faded through some close up of his injuries.

>Human: Came in peace and asked for allies in this brand new dark time

The diplomats who voted to ally with humans collected around the two shuttles on Aafa. Like all the shadow caste’s collected intelligence, this was publicly available now.

>Human: We did not stop looking, for a truth behind it all

I don’t know what deals production made, but they managed to get the actual footage of humans interrogating their first Arxur POW.

>Human: Can you tell us, is that what made us really special after all this time

Body camera footage of UN forces taking a captive human out of the Archive’s cyropods. To compliment the singer’s gentler tones for this line, the camera focuses on the dawning recognition on human’s face.

>Human: Once we believed our world was burnin’ to the ground

The human’s voice strained as they cried out, while photos of the Battle of Earth flashed across the screen. All the photos were taken from ground-level, from people looking up at the space battle that could have ended their species.

>Human: Oh well, I guess we’re gonna find out

A single photo of Chief Hunter Isif and his soldiers landing outside New York City. All three singers delivered the next 2 lines in harmony.

>All: Let’s see how far we’ve come

Six images with rapid cuts, in time to the beat:

A Dossur being carried down the street by a human

A human napping with his Yotul baby-brother and two Venlil pups

A Sivkit listening to their human husband playing the ukulele

A crayon drawing of a human father with his 4 Arxur children

A Yulpa daughter being taught to read by their human mother

A human eating lunch while wearing their Krakotl friend as a hat

>All: Let’s see how far we’ll go

After the deluge of stimulation, a single image is held on screen for the entirety of this line. A single image to represent the central theme of first episode. It is a poster for Orphaned Stars, the UN’s agency for facilitating off-world adoptions. It was founded only 3 years after humans discovered FTL, and it is credited for humans having the highest interspecies adoption rate for 12 cycles running. It showed several non-human pups before a stylized sunrise, with a simple message across the top and contact information across the bottom.

>Human: So, you said we were weak and couldn’t hold our own

Footage of a Krakotl minister talking down to his Venlil subordinate, which would have been career ending in any good society but was instead the state-sponsored propaganda of the cripplers.

>Human: But now, we will rebuild from the bone

Naturally, I followed that scene of weakness with one of empowerment, so I cut to Venlil physical therapy class, with the instructor doing leg scissors to help fix their knocked knees.

>All: Let’s see how far we’ve come

A carved club, found in by the first Venlil-lead archaeological exposition

The hidden library of White Hill University

A Venlil soldier with missing wool and a scarred face

A replica Skalgian firearm being crafted by a Venlil gunsmith

A department photo of the Blackriver Police Department

The opening ceremony of the first Venlil Olympics

>All: Let’s see how far we’ll go

Time for one final image to symbolize the Venlil’s transformation. A military recruitment poster featuring a Skalga spec ops operative posing in full combat gear. The entire suit is black with mobile ear-covers, a wide face-plate to maximize peripheral vision, thick, ceramic plates along the chest and limbs, and flexible mesh for at the joins. Their tail is posed to draw the eye to the straight legs and functional knees.

I really hoped Da liked this next part. I could already feel my scales turn light blue around the snout.

>Yotul: Steam and steel powered the day, but we didn’t really know

The Yotul singer’s verse started with a painting of a Yotul port, with workers attending to many steamships and families enjoying the beach.

>Yotul: Feds would tear it all down for scrap in just a year or so

A photograph of the same location, shot from the same angle. The docks are now desolate, with the burned out husk of a half-sunken boat being the only thing close to the shoreline.

>Yotul: Started cryin’ and who could stop themselves

I showed a news segment celebrating the melting down of the last locomotive on Mainland. In my periphery, I could see my father smolder a dangerous reddish orange.

>Yotul: Its time for running’, but there’s no where to run to

I used videos parents took of exterminators escorting a group of teenage Yotul, forcing them to walk during on their Running Day ceremony to prevent stampedes. What better way to emphasis the Yotul’s forced acceptance of their own debasement?

>Yotul: Sat down with my betben, we took a look around

Here was a wide shot of a Yotul ghetto in central Mainland. Pothole dot the road, the houses had faded and chipped paint, and trash-bags lined the street.

>Yotul: Said, “Where we going’, man? You know the world is set for Denkin

I juxtaposed that poverty with an extremely low angle shot of a pristine and flawless Exterminator’s Hall.

>Yotul: Say your goodbyes if you’ve got someone you can say goodbye to”

A daguerreotype of a Yotul family playing with their Hensa. A slight lighting change offscreen causes the image to shift from the positive to a haunting negative.

>Yotul: But humans told us to rebuild what was lost

I had to use the playbill for the Leirn-wide premier of the human play Hadestown, featuring a mixed cast of humans and Yotul. For some reason I couldn’t find the poster.

>Yotul: Can we? I guess we’re gonna find out

A rugged Yotul with tears on their snow-white muzzle holding a long-haired Hensa cub in the arms.

>All: Let’s see how far we’ve come  
(Human: Right now)

A striped hat with a brass emblem

An abandoned steel-mill filled with rusted machinery

Several Yotul in a rundown bar drowning their problems

A team of Yotul rail-workers laying tracks alongside humans

A noble Yotul in a cloth mask overseeing the first test of the shield busters

A Yotul sitting behind the counter of a textiles shop

>All: Let’s see how far we’ll go

The roasting room of Leirn’s largest coffee factory, 2nd largest in the galaxy. Dozens industrial-sized roaster fill the room, their 2 story high drums and matching pans were polished to a brilliant shine. The predominately Yotul workforce navigates mazes of walkways above and alleyways below the behemoths. The hop about with the confidence, coordination, and caution of people who have done a dangerous task thousands of times.

I knew what came next and wrapped my tail around Ma's to prepare.

>Yotul: Lightning, cutting, ice baths all came to an end

Images flashed across of stained electric chairs, filthy surgery suits, and rusted tubs with loops for restraints on the rim.

>Yotul: Now we will see how to truly mend

A Zurulian in scrubs getting hugged by a human child in a leg-cast.

>All: Let’s see how far we’ve come (Human: Again)

A Venlil child with a notebook being strapped to a table

The infamous photograph of Tarlim the Exonerated being escorted to court in a neck-restraint

Zurulian Hospital Fleet members working with alongside Arxur to treat humans

A masked human and older Zurulian demonstrating medical equipment to a college class

An albino Gojid getting a saliva sample taken by a clearly nervous Zurulian nurse

A Zurulian administrating ‘Cure’ reversal treatment to a Gojid

>All: Let’s see how far we’ll go

A Zurulian with a pink armband talking to a Venlil in a garden. The Venlil is tall with solid black fur and dark grey ears and is watering the plants as he talks. The distinct burn marks from a shock collar are clear on the Venlil’s neck, but he otherwise appears to be an average adult with a hobby. I remember overhearing two producers complain about how much that shot cost just in terms of compensating that Venlil, but the director kept insisting that an interview a violent PD patient was necessary.

Those thoughts left my mind when I noticed Ma stopped stroking my back. I turned my head to look at Ma, but she already camouflaged herself to be nearly invisible in the darkness of my room. The song entered the breakdown, but I didn’t care about any of that.

“I am so sorry Ma!” I moved the bowl aside to get up and turn off the monitor “We can stop watch-”

“No.” She swiftly moved her hand to my shoulder and pushed me back into my seat. “I am safe here. I will ne-never go back. I am loved.” Ma repeated her old mantra again, softly. Da put his arm on my back and shifted to a comforting green. I settled back down and got ready for the Krakotl’s verse.

>Krakotl: It’s lies, lies, empire built on lies

To match the lower energy section, I had the images slowly faded into each other for the breakdown. First was the ‘Pure Evil’ exhibit banner, then Thydoron giving an interview on his Yotul *‘documentary’*, and finally the root of the problem with the Farsul Archive’s logo.

>Krakotl: You wanted total control and there’s no way to hide

Horrific footage from the Leirn coup of a Krakotl exterminator beating the bound human ambassador with her flamethrower as a silent Gojid watches.

>Krakotl: That you made cruel, cruel, you made us so cruel

3 more images of exterminator cruelty against human; a man in a blue spacesuit standing before a Venlil, an emaciated woman on her knees before Zurulian in a train station, and a woman clutching her forearm as a Hanchen brandishes their baton.

>Krakotl: You tricked us into war, you tricked us as your fools

Nikonus had a sickeningly sweet expression as he gloated above a dry-heaving Captain Solvin.

>Krakotl: Now there’s dead, dead, just so many dead

Here I used orbital photos of Nishtal, the Gojid cradle and Fahl. These large scale but impersonal images sets up to contrast the horror that comes happens next.

>Krakotl: No help sent for our planet, no help for the cattle

Footage provided by the Collective of Arxur capturing their first cattle.

>Krakotl: But, there is hope, hope, we all still have hope

For a line about hope I obviously show footage of children born as cattle playing in a treatment facility. I could have cut between 3 facilities, but I needed to slow down even more as the music built tension, so instead I stuck to a single example.

>Krakotl: Now that the truth is out and we know what to do

I played a clip of the Nikonus and Giznel talking over comms in split-screen, so we could focus on both of the monsters at once.

>Krakotl: We can build each other up from the ruins

A beautifully framed shot of diplomats applauding after the unanimous vote to form the Sapient Coalition...

>Krakotl: But how? You are now gonna find out

...that was contrasted perfectly the dark and grimy shot of Kalsim sitting in a cell staring blankly at a holopad.

>All: Let’s see how far we’ve come

A Krakotl starting a brawl after some species vote against human genocide

A Krakotl is a prestige exterminator’s dress uniform giving a speech to a pack hall

A Krakotl looking at a Colonel Gabreski holding a family photo

A Krakotl aiming a gun at a human’s head while a Yotul aimed a gun at her head

A Krakotl, probably too young to drink, speaking at a podium to a room of Gojid

A Krakotl handcuffing a Humanity First terrorist while her roughed-up, undercover partner watched

>All: Let’s see how far we’ll go

A Krakotl and human officer inspecting mixed race platoon in UN garb. The platoon was mostly human, but some Venlil and Gojid could easily be picked out. Two Yotul wearing helmets bearing a red cross were also present. Both his scars and demeanor made it clear the Krakotl was a veteran many times over, although he walked abreast with the other officer.

>Krakotl: At first, pred versus prey got our world turned into glass

First was a picture of a mile-wide crater on the Gojid’s cradle, with no life in sight

>Krakotl: But then, learned the chain xzik-xzik to grass

Then I used a slide-wipe to show the same place now, a meadow filled with grasses and dotted with bushes tended to by Gojid and humans

>All: Let’s see how far we’ve come (Human: Again)

A meadow with the sod disturbed in one rectangular area next to a tree

A rookie Gojid exterminator fleeing in terror from a mobbing crow

Two Gojid ecologists, a married pair, giving a presentation to their son’s class

A pendent with a symbol of 6 chains connecting to a central ring, resting in a Gojid paw

Humans soldiers and Gojid exterminators fighting off Arxur side-by-side

A Gojid and a human setting up a birdhouse on an apartment windowsill

>All: Let’s see how far we’ll go

Two Gojid in a submersible, starring out at the depth of the cradles ocean for the first time. The camera is behind the two sets, so we don’t get shots of their faces. Still, their ears are flapping with excitement and their claws keep pointing out new discoveries that go past their window. Brilliantly painted fish occasionally swim by in a school of a dozen or so. Behind them is the a living forest of bioluminescent kelp, swaying and dancing with the currents.

It was time for the song’s outro, with the singers really stretching their voices to the limits. Right at my favorite part too.

>All: Let’s see how far we’ve come

An episode of the show ‘The Exterminators’ feature on AI-generated Ambassador Williams

Fear-mongering posters warning Harchen about the human ‘blood-lust’ and ‘predatory-deceit’

A Harchen posing with his painting of a Venlil and human sitting tail-in-paw

A 5 piece band of mixed species preforming for a bar of humans while a Harchen backstage looks on

The opening screen for the video game depicting many Harchen and Farsul in an underwater complex

The scene for the very popular and still running pups’ show Skalgan Squad

>All: Let’s see how far we’ll go

We finally get to the image showing just how far Harchen media has progressed since the Fed’s dark age. A poster for last year’s blockbuster *Thilliar of Marhal* showed the titular Thilliar staring off in contemplation, huge about the movie’s title. His human side-kick was in silhouette in the lower left corner, raising his signature whip in defiance and challenge. Before him was the army of exterminators,  that Thilliar must outwit and outmaneuver throughout the movie. Only though his understanding of the terrain and ancient Harchen society can the hero rescue our heritage from those monsters who tried to burn it and ensure our slavery to a self-serving, colonialist power.

Getting all the clips for the next part was easily the hardest part of the project, but when I showed it to our Thafki sound-engineer she cried.

>All: Let’s see how far we’ve come 

The First Wave was danced by Thafki on Aestus for a New Years festival

The Second Wave was danced by Thafki cattle, preforming in a large mud puddle/ their water supply

The Third Wave was a danced by Ambassador Kilitfu for a home video filmed by his giggling wife

The Fourth Wave was a danced by a River Wolf trying to gain serenity and calm before a mission

The Fifth Wave was a danced by a cattle-rescue on Lesser Sispa working through his rage

The Sixth Wave was a danced by a teacher for his class of pups, 3/4 Thafki and 1/4 human

>All: Let’s see how far we’ll go

The grand finale  of the Seventh Wave, as preformed by Lillypad. The venue was a dock/viewing platform specially constructed at Ocean’s Breeze, Leirn for the occasion. Lillypad was wrapped in multi-colored cloths, appearing to be tied down and with no way to surface for air. She exhaled beneath the surface and let a blank look cross her eyes, an act so convincing, that some on the audience reported that they though her symbolic drowning became literal. I still feel on unsettling panic as I watch.

But there was little time to focus on that, as undoubted the most controversial part was about to begin.

>All: Let’s see how far we’ve come

Chief Hunter Isif standing at the Sapient Coalician’s podium with a Dossur balanced on his head

A confident Arxur posing with a very long sniper rifle before a mountain of fluffy pillows

A terrified Arxur lying on a hospital bed and missing several limbs being comforted by another

A nervous Arxur child with a damaged eye standing in an exterminator suit up to the neck

An awkward Arxur trying to smoke while watching a Nevok delivering a colony-wide announcement

A energetic Arxur child planting flowerbed after flowerbed by road on Wriss

>All: Let’s see how far we’ll go

And finally, to truly encapsulate how the Arxur have demilitarized and become a peaceful people over the last 17 years, a photo of a human teaching Arxur philosophy. He stand at the head of a lecture hall filled with about 2 dozen college-aged Arxur. Although barely adults, any one would have easily been able to rip the humans head from his shoulders. Yet not a trace of fear or unease flick across his face. It was clear he was as comfortable teaching Arxur ethics as any other sapients.

>All: Let’s see how far we’ll go

The final image to close out my contribution to the project was a family photo of the now retired Governor Tarva and Ambassador Noah. Their Venlil daughter was human son were each enjoying a game of ‘uppies’ with their parents. Smiles and tail-wags abounded where anatomy allowed.

The image held with the drumroll, but slowly faded out as the music died down. Today it revealed the title of the first episode: *Human Families*. Next week it will say *Venlil Strength* and after that *Yotul Industry*. Then will be *Krakotl Military*, *Gojid Ecology*, *Harchen Media*, *Thafki Dance*, and finally, *Arxur Disarmament*.

I turned toward Da. His scales weren't pastel purple from amusement, or pale white with surprise, or even a deep blue with embarreshment. Instead he was bright green with pride, with dashes of light blue with enjoyment. I suppose that is good enough.",8,1743475157.0,NatureofPredators,8,1.0,False

I met this girl at work and she is also 24. We really hit it off. There was obvious chemistry between us, and at some point, we ended up at her place after 2 days of going out. She mentioned a few times that her shoulders were hurting, which now I realize might have been a hint that she wanted me to make a move. But I didn’t do anything—I just played it safe, and we ended up just sleeping.

Since then, things have felt different. She’s been more distant, taking hours to reply to messages, and at work, she doesn’t seem as comfortable around me as before. She even switched seats to sit away from me. But at the same time, she still bought me a coffee when I asked, so it’s not like she’s completely shut me out.

Now, I’m trying to figure out how to turn things around. I don’t want her to think I’m a pushover or that I wasn’t into her. I just need another chance to show her I’m not that guy, but I don’t know how to make it happen.

Could you please help me on how to win her?

P,S. I didn't make any move because I just had started to have a cold sore and I was not feeling good.

I have bought a new top burr holder which helped a little and did change the alignment from the original top burr holder but it’s still off.

I’m just bored.  The grind is never ending.  At least when I was drinking it momentarily felt like there was a fun intermission.  Go out, have a couple of drinks at a bar, chat with some random folks, go home.  Harmless.  I fucking miss it.

Siting at home.  Two fingers of really great scotch.  Chat with spouse over the scotch.  One of the reasons I stopped drinking was to try to hit reset on some marriage issues but they’ve just gotten worse. 

I can’t do it though.  That couple of drinks at the bar turns into getting totally wasted and lap dances at a strip club (which is just… dumb, honestly, setting aside how my spouse would react).  The two fingers of scotch turns into multiple Irish coffees every Saturday and Sunday morning and other day drinking, not being present at all with my kid.

God damnit.  IWNDWYT even though I would very, very much like to to get away from it all. Obviously the drink doesn’t fix anything or make it better, but man, while I have the buzz, life sure does seem slightly more tolerable.

1jokz9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/BungouStrayDogs/comments/1jokz9u/shortish_rant/,Short(-ish) Rant,"“Atsushi is the only reason Lucy is even involved with the ADA; she’s a satellite character!”

Erm, ackshually, Atsushi is the only reason Lucy knows the ADA is *innocent*, and her *quid-pro-quo mindset* was – for a time – the only reason she was involved with the ADA. 🤓☝️

~~Okay, no, but seriously-~~

Lucy is one of few characters who understands Atsushi on a fundamental level, simply by virtue of perceiving his victimhood (and the heroism that belies it). She recognizes that [he bases his worth off of his ability to save people](https://i.imgur.com/Pfyzco6.jpeg) – not as much as he used to, granted, but still. She doesn’t put him on an untouchable pedestal, say, the way Higuchi does Akutagawa or Teruko did Fukuchi. On the contrary, she's hyper-aware of his flaws, his reckless heroism above all. Not only is she [highly critical of his self-destructive habits](https://i.imgur.com/d4g2HNu.jpeg), she represents their antithesis: her very *introduction* posed a challenge to Atsushi’s hero narrative in the sense that, try as he might, he couldn’t save her, [only defeat her](https://tenseikizokunoisekaiboukenroku.com/images/ATHN6SuuC6dSA7XRK5SK1635822780.jpg). Conventional heroism – the kind he used to save Kyōka, for example – wasn't enough, and lo and behold, it wasn't his strength that got through to her, rather, [his vulnerability](https://i.imgur.com/OoOQhyK.jpeg).

The same goes for why [she defends him when the ADA is framed for terrorism](https://i.imgur.com/DO7yXhX.jpeg). It isn’t because, in her mind, Atsushi is a perfect being who can do no wrong. Unlike Aya, another non-law enforcement character who believes in the Agency’s innocence, Lucy’s rationale isn’t anything along the lines of “his virtues saved me, so he couldn’t possibly be bad.” It's because terrorism – and by extension associating with other terrorists – would *fly in the face of* Atsushi's reckless heroism. Y’know… the unit by which he measures his right to live? So in other words, Lucy advocates for the ADA because she understands Atsushi. Not because of her crush or even because she has innate faith in him (hell, we know she doesn’t). Because she understands him.

As for why she helps the ADA, at first it’s out of [a sense of indebtedness](https://i.imgur.com/JW90h6A.jpeg). Sure, so far only *she’s* been able to save Atsushi in the conventional sense – [not vice-versa](https://i.imgur.com/ASJxylx.jpeg) – but in the same way conventional heroism couldn’t get through to her where vulnerability could, everything she’s done for him pales in comparison to his ultimate act of compassion. What good is repeatedly saving Atsushi’s hide via Anne’s Room if [she can’t even comfort him properly](https://i.imgur.com/07mHpU3.jpeg)? So naturally, she tries to repay her debt. She goes searching for that elusive, commensurate act that will make her and Atsushi even. Ultimately, though, that search is flipped on its head. In the climax of the Sky Casino arc, Atsushi saves her from Nathaniel, and this sparks an epiphany: just as her care for *Atsushi* doesn’t depend on his being a *hero*, Atsushi's care for *her* doesn’t depend on her being *vulnerable*. They already *are* even.

Only once her feelings of debt are done away with does Lucy start helping Atsushi and the others because she *wants* to – because [she really, truly cares](https://i.imgur.com/GNGBwFz.png). Not the artificial care that comes with repaying a debt, but the kind she showcases when she stays by Atsushi’s side after he faints, pressing a cold towel to his face. The kind that involves refusing to hurt Atsushi in any way, even to jog potentially vital memories. That’s when it becomes fair to say she’s doing it for Atsushi. Before that, she’s doing it because of her own personal struggle – a struggle no doubt born of trauma. First she had to justify taking up space she had no choice in taking up via physical labor, then she had to justify keeping her surrogate family via successful missions; is it really any wonder she felt the need to justify her relationship with Atsushi? Her crush didn’t even factor in, save for the occasional blushy moment.

And that’s the thing: Lucy’s quid-pro-quo mindset is seen *primarily* in her relationship with Atsushi, *not* exclusively. [She asks for “repayment” from Fukuzawa in the Cannibalism arc](https://tenseikizokunoisekaiboukenroku.com/images/fgRFiPpt86b15jtLlb081635824480.jpg); she repays the café owner for his kindness by keeping his coffee beans fresh in Anne’s Room; and she repays Ango for getting her out of hot water with the Division by agreeing to the infiltration plan. Atsushi is Lucy’s main dynamic, so naturally they share the most interactions, but her character doesn’t revolve around him. She has conflicts and goals of her own; he simply plays into them. Keep in mind, clearing the ADA’s name would also mean that she gets to go back to the café – to reunite with the café owner and his wife and keep chatting with the Agency members during coffee breaks. She’s finally found a place to belong, and she wants to hold onto that. Why wouldn’t she?

I cut it open when I thought it was done & there was enough to fill one of those shack sized Rubbermaids.

March 20:

* I feel sick and notice that I can't smell my coffee. I DoorDash a COVID test, remember that I have one from a few years ago, cancel the order. Start getting ready for work, take the COVID test, and forget about it for like 30+ minutes. I look at it about 5 minutes before I need to leave and see that it's positive. Everyone shows up sick. Coworkers cough into their mouths. The test is old and has been sitting out for a while.  Those are things that I tell myself as I leave. That was massively irresponsible of me. Compartmentalization, justification, and being in denial won't excuse that. I was wrong.
* Larry calls me 5 minutes before I am supposed to be there, wondering where I am. He hangs up on me. I clock in on time, and he makes some comment that just irritated me. I was going to just be quiet (again stupid) and tell him about my COVID test. I told him I DoorDash’d a test. Dumb, very dumb. I figured being at delivery's mercy was smarter than admitting that I kiiiiinda took my time taking what I had at home. I was wrong here.
* About 45 minutes into my shift, he sends me home
* Larry wants confirmation of and a picture of the test. Which I found dumb because tests should not be read that long after being taken. In hindsight, I wish I had just sent a photo of it. I placed an Amazon order for new tests and let him know.
* He wanted a DoorDash receipt. I zoomed in on the order with my card info and canceled status being out, but name and test visible. I close the tab. He didn't like that it was zoomed in like that, and I opened a new tab and took another screenshot. He wanted the timestamp on it. I then called my PCP's office for a COVID test. While I was on the phone, I guess he texted me that he was en route to my home with a COVID test. After the call, I just closed my eyes and didn't see the text
* Larry called, and I picked up the phone to see who it was without realizing that I answered it. I know I went, “What the fuck do you want now?” and realized that the call was answered. He wasn't happy and didn't buy my explanation.  He was downstairs. I didn't invite him. I have never invited him to my home during my entire employment there.
* I went downstairs and opened the lobby door for Larry, who told me to take a COVID test in the apartment lobby with no surface to put everything down. He wanted the results that evening, not wanting to wait until the next morning.
* I dropped the test materials more than once. Neighbors are walking by me. I feel like a criminal with how Larry is treating me, I'm getting read the riot act, and during the waiting (it was not the full 10 minutes), the way Larry spoke to me was reminiscent of the crazy making behavior of a toxic relationship. I wish I had the presence of mind to record the conversation or have someone on the phone to listen to the conversation. It was not okay, but maybe I am just overly sensitive.
* Overall, this is a spectacle being made in front of my neighbors. I look at the test early, and note that it is negative. Larry is very mad and leaves,

March 21:

* COVID test from the clinic is positive. My PCP is out of the country and the office closes early on Friday, so I couldn't call about the note that said I tested positive for COVID on 3/20. I assume that was because it was the first day of the first positive test for quarantine/return to work purposes.
* I sent the letter to Larry via text and email.

March 22:

* The Amazon COVID test came back positive. I saved the second one.

March 25:

* I received a text from Larry that says: “CDC guidelines are 10 days so if you were planning to come in tonight or tomorrow do not, same for the weekend.""
* I took the second Amazon COVID test. Negative.
* The CDC website doesn't say 10 days. I called the hotline to confirm the current protocol.
* I figured I should just not argue about the guidelines because Larry probably wouldn't care anyway. I figured it lets the situation blow over.

March 27:

* Received an email from the owner:” …You were immediately sent home by General Manager \[name\]  You were provided with a Covid Test and it was negative.   You have missed subsequent shifts including Wednesday, March 27 and we have been informed that you have called out for your scheduled shift on Thursday, March 27.  We need an explanation as to why you have missed any scheduled shifts.   Due to the unclear situation regarding your claim of having Covid we may require a Doctor clearance to return to work.  Please reply with your explanation and your ability to work as scheduled ASAP.”
* I explained and threw Larry under the bus by mentioning that he showed up “at my home unannounced and uninvited” with the COVID test. I included the screenshots of the text conversation in the email along with my physician's note and information from the CDC. I stated that: “to my understanding, it's acceptable to leave quarantine 24 hours after symptoms are gone and there's no fever. I've been feeling better since Tuesday and am able and willing to return to work.”

March 28:

* Radio silence from everyone since the email. I texted Larry to confirm that I am to stay home from work for the weekend.

March 29:

* Larry texts me back as I am about to walk in that I am to stay home. This was 9 minutes before my scheduled shift. Larry had over 10 hours to reply.

Today:

* I noticed that I am not scheduled for any work this coming week. The schedule for everyone else has been posted. I sent him the following: “I noticed that I am not scheduled for the upcoming week. Am I still employed?” That was over three hours ago.

Wisconsin is an at-will employment state, but this silence just strikes me as petty. It seems that my employment there is over, but I do not have enough saved up to cover my expenses while looking for another job, and without termination, I can't collect unemployment to help in the meantime. I do not want to take any action against what seems to be my former employer; I am just not sure what I *can* do. Should I just file for unemployment anyway?",0,1743474074.0,legaladvice,0,0.5,False
