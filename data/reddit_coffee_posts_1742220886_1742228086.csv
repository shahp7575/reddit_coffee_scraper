However it’s currently selling for $1700. Not a price we’re eager to pay but I haven’t found anything that we like or that fits the space/look.

How difficult do you all think this could be to build ourselves? Looks like there are 6 key pieces to the table (2 table boards and 4 spindles). I’m curious if I’m oversimplifying how easy DIYing this could be to save us a ton of money. I have the tools for this, would just need to source the materials.",1,1742227642.0,woodworking,2,1.0,False

I just wanted a night to disconnect with my wife. I’ve been feeling really depressed recently, suicidal even, with my own family stuff and just the current state of America
 
Multiple times she was on her phone messaging, or messaging quickly until I came back in the bedroom and would put her phone down. 
 
I don’t ask too much honestly, I like coffee and going to the garden centre, I like to feel loved and reassured, handholds and little kisses here & there, no shame of admitting it too, I adore my wife, there is so much love in my heart for her
 
I make breakfast, lunch, dinner, I even get out of bed before she goes to work and make her lunch so it’s freshly made on the day
 
I clean the house, do the washing, or the handiwork , look after my partner’s dogs, our cats, reptiles, fish, snails.
 
Let me mention one of my wife’s dogs hates me, bites me, barks and growls, hates any time my wife and I are close, even just sitting together. He won’t even come out the cage during the day, he will just sit in the glaring at me. He has cut me open, scarred me, honestly kind of traumatised me haha 
 
I’m just beat, I’m tired
 
Usually in the evenings, my partner is playing games on the phone or scrolling, watching videos, whatever else, she seems content doing it so it’s not an issue, I’m out in the kitchen and cooking dinner and cleaning up anyway
 
I’m asking for too much, wanting a night to disconnect? And I better off alone? Do I sound like I am just too much for anyone? 
 
I just feel like I’m not a good partner and that maybe she just doesn’t want to be close to me, idk 
 
I moved from the UK to be with my wife here in America, my family has basically disowned me, my dad hates me for it, my brothers and sisters don’t speak to me anymore, which of course is on them but I still think about it often as I love them and will continue to love them even if there is no contact
 
The above paragraph definitely added to the depression and the recent feelings of suicidal ideation
 
Please don’t be nasty, in all honesty I’m feeling really really low, humiliated, feeling disrespected and some more suicidal with just how exhausted I feel

The encounter I had, the awful smell, etc etc.

I wanted to update you all about my recent interview with Mr. Withers.

A few days ago, I was at the library when Mrs. Collins approached me.

“Hey sweetie, I’ve got to get home early today. Can you finish this all tomorrow?” She asked. I was surrounded by a few newspapers.

“Hm? I won’t be here tomorrow,” I answered as a shocked look crossed her face.

“You’re here every day though?” I grabbed my phone, snapping a picture of a newspaper before handing said piece of paper to her.

“Yeah, but I’m going to the old Withers house tomorrow,” I began to clean the area around me.

“The Withers? That old house at the end of Clarance Street?” She looked confused, “why would you want to go there?”

I sighed, lugging my backpack over my shoulder, “I'm pretty sure Mr. Withers was friends with the Smiths. In one of the newspapers I saw, he and Mr. Smith were hugging in the background of a picture from the opening day."" 

“Well, please be careful. Mr. Withers is…strange?” She didn’t sound positive in her response.

“Yeah yeah, I will be,” I smiled, and that was it. As I got into my car, I thought long and hard about Mr. Withers. What if he didn’t want to talk? I hadn’t exactly texted him. Honestly, I didn’t know if he even had a phone.

I couldn’t sleep that night and the next day at school my eyes were fixated on the clock. I needed out, I couldn’t wait to get in my car and get to the old house at the end of Clarance Street.

When school did let out, I practically jogged out of the school and into my car. Throwing on my Spotify playlist, I kicked the car into drive and peeled out of the lot. I sped to the road, obeying the traffic laws this time. When I arrived, I slowed and parked my car. Anxiety took over, I realized just how stupid this might have been.

I took in a deep breath and stepped out of the car. It was now or never.

Walking across the road and up the sidewalk, I felt a shiver run down my spine. The house was dark, the wood was splintered harshly in a few places, the swing on the porch was sitting on the ground. The windows were dark, a few of them boarded up, and the lights by the door were shattered. I racked my knuckles on the old wooden door, I thought it might break when my hand hit it.

The door flung open, an old man standing darkly in the door frame. “Who are you?! What do you want!?” He shouted. He was tall, a looming presence, towering at least a head over my own.

“Hi?” I stuttered out, unsure of his next move, “I just uhm…I wanted to ask you some questions.”

“Who are you.” It wasn’t a question.

“My name is Clara and I’m here to ask you questions,” I tried to be as firm as him.

“About?”

“The Smiths,” I wondered if this guy was always so harsh.

“Who?” A confused look crossed his face.

“The Smiths? The couple who owned the old the old grocery store over on Limestone Drive?”

“The Smiths? Oh, wait- You mean the Claymont's?” Now it was my turn to be confused.

“Claymont?”

“Why do you want to know all this, kid?” He moved to the side, silently inviting me in. I stepped inside, taking in the scene. It was lovely, like a warm cabin in the mountains during the wintertime. A candle was burning and smelt like smokey pine. 

“Well,” I turned to look at him as he shut the door, “I’m doing this research project on it.”

“That’s kind of weird kid,” he gave me a funny look. I shot him a glare in return. He began to walk through his home, I followed suit. We landed in an old, rustic-looking kitchen. It was homey and nice, kind of what I pictured my future home to look like. 

""So, I got two questions for ya',"" His thick southern drawl snapped my attention to him. 

""Shoot.""

""One, why are you doing this? Two, what do you already know?"" This guy got straight to the point.

""Well, I thought I knew a good bit. But you kinda' blew that all away..."" I trailed off, glaring at him, ""and why? Great question, I don't know.""

""You don't know?"" He scoffed, shooting me a condescending look. 

""I mean, old abandoned spooky place? Every teenager has had some kind of interest in it, I guess I'm just the only one who wants to learn,"" I tried to reason. 

""Well, you don't know much-"" He let out a short chuckle, ""you called them the Smiths.""

""That's what newspapers called them!"" I argued. 

""Well, their names were Stacy and Tom Claymont. Real shady couple- nobody knew where they even lived. One day they just showed up and opened that supermarket, then disappeared,"" He explained, moving over to the counter to start making something. 

""So, what all do you know?"" I wasn't going to sugarcoat it, I wanted answers. 

""Why do you think I know so much, kid?"" He retorted, now I could see what he was making, coffee. 

""Because I know you've shopped there."" 

His head snapped to look at me, an unreadable expression crossed his face, ""Excuse me?"" 

""Yeah, I know all about you,"" I tried to appear confident. It was a lie, but he didn't have to know that. 

""What else do you know about the place?""

""That's it. I want you to help me fill in the gaps,"" I tried to get him to talk more. He walked past me, down the hall, and to the doorway. I could hear the lock clicking and the noise of the blinds shutting only made my fear rise.  

He walked back into the room and poured himself a cup of coffee. ""If you call the cops, I'll kill you."" a lightning bolt of fear crashed into my body. I nodded, taking a seat at the kitchen island. A looming dread fell upon me, I felt like I had bitten off more than I could chew. Alarm bells were ringing in my ears, my body was telling me I was in danger.

""So, you don't know anything?"" I nodded in response. He let out a long sigh and sat down next to me, setting his coffee and a sheet of paper on the island. 

""So, back in the 90s, these guys showed up, the Claymonts. Originally it was Tom, Stacy, and their two kids Sarah and Jason. White picket fence type family, pretty sure they had a dog. They looked so normal, so loving. They opened up that store and nobody thought anything of it. Not many people shopped there since it was a little bit of a drive and other grocery stores were closer. About a month or two later, the kids disappeared,"" he took a swig of his coffee and picked up a pencil, beginning to draw something, ""I don't know what happened to them. Nobody dose. After that, Tom and Stacy went quiet, and nobody ever saw them. A few months later, Stacy and Tom disappeared. After they disappeared, nobody thought about the store and it was just left to rot,"" he was drawing a blueprint of the grocery store. 

""So why did people shop there originally...?"" I trailed off, watching him draw lines and boxes. 

""It was because of the meat,"" he answered, setting down his pencil and sliding the paper over to me. A rough blueprint of the grocery store, including details of the back. I could tell where the two doors I went through and saw the man were and the memory made me shutter. 

""What?"" I laughed a little, trying not to appear nervous, ""did it spoil easy?""

""It was human meat.""",1,1742226984.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1jdfz64,https://i.redd.it/qn9g1dsqu9pe1.png,My illustrated Capri map with some of the best things to do. Enjoy...,"I created this illustrated map of Capri to give a clear, easy-to-digest overview of the island.

A simple map with clear icons helps me plan my trip and visualize the layout of a place. 

I thought I'd include the most famous attractions as well as some of my favorite lesser-known spots from my trip.

Anyways, here's a list of the main places to visit in Capri, from the map above:

Marina Grande – The island’s main port and transport hub, where all ferries arrive. It’s also home to Marina Grande Beach, the largest beach on Capri.

Blue Grotto – The island’s most famous attraction, a sea cave where sunlight creates a glowing blue effect in the water.

Capri Town & Piazzetta – The lively heart of Capri, perfect for people-watching over coffee and exploring charming streets.

Gardens of Augustus & Via Krupp – Stunning gardens with views overlooking the Faraglioni Rocks and a historic zigzagging path carved into the cliffs.

Marina Piccola – A beautiful cove on the southern coast with crystal-clear waters and views of the Faraglioni.

San Giacomo Monastery – A peaceful historic site with impressive 17th-century frescoes.

Faraglioni Rocks – Iconic rock formations rising from the sea. Best seen by boat or from scenic viewpoints like Belvedere Tragara.

Natural Arch – A dramatic limestone arch on the east coast, accessible via a scenic walking trail.

Villa Lysis – A gorgeous, neoclassical villa in a secluded setting, offering beautiful views and a unique atmosphere.

Anacapri – The quieter, more local side of the island, known for Monte Solaro, the highest point on Capri, accessible by chairlift.

Punta Carena Lighthouse – A wild, dramatic coastal spot and one of the best places to watch the sunset on Capri.

This list could honestly go on and on, but I'll leave it at that. There's so much to see and do on this tiny island, it's really incredible.

I hope you find this helpful, or at least inspirational! :)",3,1742226794.0,amalficoast,0,1.0,False

We have been together about 5 months and I’m noticing that when things are brought up he will tell me what he’s feeling but mixed in with insults to me. For example: he just got a new job after months of working a part time job (this isn’t the issue). We were having coffee and he says something to the effect of “I’m not going to have as much time as we did in the past and things are going to change. How do you feel about that?” I say “things will be fine, we will figure it out” he wanted reassurance and I missed that-my bad. He was obviously not satisfied with my answer and said something like “you are so intelligent but you just don’t use it sometimes.” Then I’m frustrated because he’s essentially calling me stupid when what he meant was “i need reassurance.” The conversation went to what he calls a “total loss” and we decided to talk about it another time when we’re cooled down. Two days later it comes up again and the conversation goes to shit again. I feel misunderstood and attacked and when I express this he says “let me know if you want to be a good time couple, that will be fine I just need to adjust my expectations. It’s not worth it.” 


This is just an example of what’s becoming a pattern. I was in one (mostly unhealthy) relationship from 20-23 so my experience is limited.

Turns out, a lot has changed! 

Earth’s Journey Through Space (and Ours!):

* Our planet has traveled 30.95 billion km (19.23 billion miles) around the Sun.
* Meanwhile, the entire solar system has moved 239.5 billion km (148.8 billion miles) through the Milky Way.
* Just by existing on Earth, I (and everyone else my age) have traveled 30.95 billion km (19.23 billion miles) through space—without taking a single step!

Stars Being Born & Dying:

* Roughly 3.3 million new stars have formed.
* Around 964,000 stars have burned out and died.

Human Population Changes:

* Since my birth, about 4.64 billion people have been born.
* At the same time, around 1.93 billion people have passed away.
* Net population increase: \~2.7 billion more humans!

Water Humanity Has Drunk:

* If we assume the average person drinks about 2.5 liters of water daily, then humanity has collectively consumed about 241 trillion liters of water since 1992.

Personal Stats (Even If You Didn’t Notice!):

* My heart has beaten approximately 1.39 billion times since birth.
* I’ve taken about 278 million breaths.
* Assuming an average of 5,000 steps per day, I’ve taken around 60.3 million steps.

Other Crazy Facts:

* The Sun has emitted more energy in this time than all of human civilization has ever used.
* Light from stars 44 light-years away is just now reaching Earth since I was born.
* The Earth's tectonic plates have shifted by about 4.5 meters (15 feet).
* If I had been falling at terminal velocity since birth, I would have fallen over 1.2 trillion kilometers by now (of course, I’d be long gone, but still fun to think about).
* About 9 quadrillion cups of coffee have been consumed worldwide in this time.

It’s kind of surreal to think about how much has happened while I’ve just been… existing

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

\* Someone intelligent, **open-minded,** and always **up for trying new things**. Bonus points if you can **travel the world on a budget** and appreciate **a good cup of coffee.**

\* We can **explore hidden alleys** and **quirky shops** in our city, looking for the **best street food** or the **most unexpected treasure**!

\* Someone who's **down to earth** and doesn't take themselves too seriously. (But also **appreciates a good pun** )

**Here's what I'm not looking for:**

\* Low-effort replies or negativity. This is **a genuine attempt at connection, not a karma grab.**

\* Anyone solely focused on appearance. **I care more about what's inside than what's on the outside.**

**If this resonates with you, shoot me a DM!** Tell me your favorite meme, your dream travel destination, or anything else that makes you, you. The most interesting messages will get a response.

**Worst that happens?** We become internet pen pals with a shared love for **Shayari**.

**Best case scenario?** We hit it off, grab some **pani puri,** and maybe even find something special along the way.

I'm a writer and artist. I've been writing some stories for a comic series and recently been stuck on how to progress. Last week I bought a bag of crack for the first time in years and no joke, I had one puff and I managed to unravel the knot of stories I had. I finished the dose and my mind was on fire and with so many ideas that I managed to solve my story issues. In the days since I got the bag I've written 6-7 more stories. I'll literally be smoking or sitting in nature after having a dose and an idea will pop up. And then another idea, and then another story, as if by divine revelation. Cocaine is a super mind altering drug that expands the mind. I'm convinced of it.

Looking at the long list of addicts that are great writers from Philip K. Dick to Conan Doyle to Stephen King and others I've made my mind that cocaine is an enhancer of the creative process due to the chemical component of cocaine. Shit literally gives you super powers and makes it hard to quit because of this enhancement and unlike alcohol it doesn't alter the mind in a detrimental manner. You can stay sober and alert. This makes it a dangerous combination. I just had my morning fix with coffee and I'm so peaceful with all of my day arranged and planned out in an organized way despite my usual ADHD knot of daily goals. The knot is neatly placed in my brain. This is powerful. So much so that I'm convinced that a writer that injects gets an edge over a writer that doesn't.

We also have two accent chairs that we plan to place facing the sectional, with their backs to the TV, along with a coffee table and a rug in the center.

Now, I'm second-guessing myself and wondering if I made a mistake. Maybe we should have gone with the sectional that has the chaise on the left side (when sitting on it). The reason I avoided that option was because I didn’t want to block that wall in case we decided to place the chairs or a plant there—but maybe I was wrong?

Or would a better layout be placing the chairs with their backs to the staircase and moving the TV to the currently empty wall? In that case, having the chaise on the bookshelf side wouldn’t be an issue. What do you think?

Do you believe in ghosts, holy and haunting?

Touches that reach beyond our constructions of time

Stories uncontained by the arms of history

Presence that spills over, palpable and potent

Beyond our rigid binaries of ends and beginnings

a mysterious fluidity among realms of living.

Lives leave traces among us

Relics summon them without our even asking

A coffee cup. A collar. A mere suggestion of a scent.

Imprints and remnants dance and weep in our midst

Eerie residue in transitions of matter and spirit

There is grief that outlasts death

Horrors untended, still screaming unheard

Love that aches for more time

We mostly move through our days unnoticing and arrogant

until something peculiar animates our senses,

disturbs our illusions of severed connections,

and untidies our certainties of knowing and fact.

A wider web of life ensnares us

sticky and elusive.

Every fragile thread,

weaving a cosmic tapestry,

across planes of existence.

Call it heaven. Call it hell.

To this hallowed tangle, we belong.",1,1742225040.0,u_Default-Avatar,0,1.0,False

1jdf74d,https://www.reddit.com/r/recoverywithoutAA/comments/1jdf74d/recovering_from_aa_what_it_was_like_what_happened/,"Recovering from AA - What it was Like, What Happened, and What it's Like Now","I joined Alcoholics Anonymous three years ago at the age of 22, following a prolonged unhealthy relationship with alcohol since my mid-teens which culminated in daily drinking since the age of 20, morning drinking in the final months, and sporadic cocaine binges and use of other substances on and off throughout the years. When I got to my first meeting in a small city in England, I was the youngest there by at least 20 years and felt out of place based on my relatively well-kept appearance, although mentally I was absolutely shot to pieces. However, I was greeted with open arms and accepted (begrudgingly by some) into the fold, told where the next meeting was and recommended to get there, given a copy of the Big Book and Living Sober, and told to keep coming back and to get a sponsor.

That was the start of a year and a half journey in the fellowship. I dedicated my evenings and weekends to getting to meetings, at least one a day for the first nine months, and outside of that I socialised almost exclusively with people I had met within the rooms. I quickly realised that in order to fit in that I should speak like everybody else, pick up those same one liners and use them in share backs, come up with wild and powerful metaphors, tell my past like it was a story akin the Bill’s in the book, and parrot back how AA had transformed my life. I had old timers with over 30 years of sobriety telling my that “AA is safe in your hands”, “gold-standard of recovery”, “shining example of what sobriety can do”, all things which inflated my ego and confirmed that I was doing the right thing… Or so I thought.

In the background, I had a sponsor whom I spoke to daily on the phone or in person for the first year of my recovery. I was attending conventions across the country, sharing whenever called upon, attending hospital and institution visits, being a cornerstone of the young peoples’ fellowship which was growing in the area. However, all of this I did whilst never fully working the 12 Steps (something which I craftily hid from all who knew me, except my sponsor).

As a gay man in a conservative area, I always struggled with fitting in in the rooms and not being judged based on my sexuality. Whilst frowned upon by some, I surrounded myself with women in the fellowship whom I felt safer around than the men. There were a few of us who stuck together as queer people and often spoke about setting up an LGBTQ+ meeting, only for old timers to tell us how we weren’t special and different, and that there was no place for dividing the fellowship. In the Home Group which I became secretary of, I made suggestions around addressing safeguarding concerns and minor changes to the literature to make the rooms more inclusive of non-cis/het people who would come across the rooms.

Then something changed. I was a year and a half sober, and in the worst place I had ever been in. Despite all I had been doing to keep myself from drinking, my mental health started coming out in other directions. I had developed anorexia off the back of years of disordered eating and poor relationship with my body image, but there was nobody in the rooms I could confide in without being told it was an outside issue and not to be discussed. I ended up in A&E following an episode of self-harm which went too far, but once again I couldn’t discuss how I was feeling in meetings.

For reasons I still don’t understand to this day, I started to be shunned by those I would formerly have called my closest friends – complete no contact on the phone, no eye-contact in person. I couldn’t understand why, and being sat in the chair of a meeting looking back at a room of people which seemed to suddenly hate me was horrendous. I was brought to tears in a group conscience meeting where the safeguarding and inclusion measures which had previously been agreed on were all overturned by my former friends who had previously voted in support of them. I never went back to that meeting after that day.

Instead, I sought out other meetings which felt safe. I returned to a previous Home Group in search of a change and some guidance from old timers whom I trusted. That very same day I was sexually assaulted in the car park after the meeting by the very same old timer who I sought help from. Who would ever believe me though? A man, with wife and children and grandchildren, over 20 years sober – if I spoke out, I would have been instantly shut down as a liar and stirring drama.

I attended different meetings again. And then discovered that one of my former friends had been accused of rape by another of my friends. I couldn’t discuss this with anybody, because we had the same sponsor, and the idea that I could even imagine that the ‘alleged’ perpetrator had committed such an offense was insane. Obviously, it was the victim making things up… He was no longer my sponsor after that day.

I attended a convention with a friend in fellowship from outside the area, a final attempt to renew my efforts within AA. I was tight on money at the time, and he had already planned and booked a hotel for the weekend so very kindly offered to change his booking from a double to a twin room so that I could attend. Except he never changed it, claiming that there must have been a mix-up at the hotel’s end when we arrived. It was all part of a ruse to get me into bed with him. Nothing happened, I was happily in a relationship and have never had any interest in anything more than friendship with anybody in the fellowship, not least him. However, I wasn’t strong enough to stand up for myself and put up with creepy advances from a man 20 years my senior for the entire weekend. I returned home and met a ‘friend’ in fellowship for coffee to discuss – they told me that I had clearly instigated the advances and that I was entirely to blame for leading him on. Admittedly, had I planned my finances accordingly the issue would have been avoided. But I refused to accept responsibility for these actions when all I was desperate for was to retain my sobriety against the backdrop of everything else going on.

I withdrew from the fellowship entirely; I attended maybe two meetings a month for about four months on the belief that without doing so I would relapse. This was a women’s only meeting, but they lovingly and graciously accepted me, and were the only people to have believed my experiences. Nonetheless, the inevitable happened a few weeks after my second sober birthday.

My partner was away for the weekend, and I saw an opportunity to cut loose and set myself free of the madness in my head for a short time, without the risk of causing hurt and damage to my relationship. My partner is sober and has been for some time, but only by personal choice rather than any historical issues. I blew through £300 of booze and coke in a night and woke up with horrendous regret but somehow the power to get to a meeting the next day. I shared back and cried through the duration of the meeting, vowing to get back into the programme. I received kindness and support from some, but most people in the rooms seemed to back away from me as if fearful that they might catch the relapse.

For around three months I tried to get to regular meetings, but I felt so unbearably uncomfortable in them that I would dissociate in an effort to get through. I couldn’t stand being around people who would give all the good talk about working the programme and being saintly human beings, whilst knowing that the moment they leave the rooms that they were treating their wives and families in such horrendous ways. I switched up my fellowships, attending CA and NA hoping to find a new safe haven and home. Still, I could not. I tried working the steps with a new sponsor, but I could not give myself to spirituality or powerlessness that they required – nor had I ever in the first two years.

Fast forward to today, I have not been to a meeting in about five months, nor spoken to anybody from that world. I realised that I was trying to fit myself into a box that was not made for me. I have a background in medicine and neuroscience, and for the whole time I was in fellowship I was trying to make myself believe in their make-believe, when I knew it made absolutely no sense that a power greater than me (which didn’t exist) could restore me to sanity (because I wasn’t insane).

I have felt so very lost because all that I knew for the past couple of years and that defined me has disappeared. My world has become very small, but I’m okay with that. I plan to get myself into therapy to discuss all of the damage that has been done to me and my mental health by being in the fellowship, and to unlearn the things that it has taught me. I can thank the fellowship for the ability it has given me to be introspective and to take stock of the things that have happened in my life which need to be addressed, but in a constructive way with a professional, rather than an old man with no qualifications who insists all that has happened to me is my fault. I am returning to mental health basics to build a foundation on which I can build myself up again – sleep, diet, exercise, journaling, rebuilding normal friendships and bonds with family. I have also realised that the traits which I self-medicated for so many years also have another contributor, more aligned with those of ADHD and autism for which I am awaiting an assessment.

Despite feeling so lost, I am beginning to find a true sense of happiness and contentedness from within. I have changed my job to make my life less chaotic whilst I recover from recovery and give myself new direction. I am starting to look at the root causes of my drinking in the first place – a lack of belonging and self-medication for my mental health – and create a life in which those core issues are not present (spoiler: it’s much easier without AA). And more critically, do I believe that alcoholism exists as a lifelong condition? Maybe for some it does, but for me I believe that it was a way of coping with life for a time, but it does not define me today.

In reviewing my ‘relapse’ outside of the gaze of AA, I believe that it was the fact that I was an AA member which made the relapse so severe. On that night I could very easily have had a couple of drinks to let go of things. But knowing that I would one day return to a meeting to own up to it, I felt like I had to go crazy. It was AA itself that contributed to the extent of the slip, that if I was going to have people looking down their nose at me, I should at least have good reason for it. That I should somehow have to prove that I am a real alcoholic/addict and be a warning for those who were considering that same course of action. The doctrine became a self-fulfilling prophecy.

I have experimented with moderation with respect to alcohol. Two glasses of wine at a Christmas dinner, and it turns out I’m not overcome with a craving which I cannot control. I even had a big night out with work in which I drank into the small hours and turned up home kebab in hand like the old times. Except it wasn’t like the old times. I wasn’t out of control; I was having fun like ‘normal drinkers’ would. I felt sorry for myself the next day, but nobody was hurt, and no harm was caused. Having been sober for an extended period of time, I can acknowledge that I would have had as much fun without drinking and still had an early night and woken up fresh the next morning. I don’t feel the need to do it again any time soon, nor to I even want to, but also what is so bad about cutting loose like anybody else once in a while?

I recognise that this sub is for people looking to find recovery, so encouraging to try drinking is not my suggestion at all. For me it was a necessary step to break free of the dogma that was instilled in me in AA. However, I can categorically say that my life is still better without alcohol than with it. I still identify as a sober person; I have no intentions to go back to the old ways because that was no way of living. What I have learned is that AA can be helpful for some, and I will never discourage anybody attending if they feel that they cannot stop drinking. But it is not a life sentence. I needed those two years of continuous sobriety that it gave me to show me that it is possible to live without drink and drugs, and now having had a direct and conscious side-by-side comparison I will still choose to. Maybe I will have a glass of champagne as a celebration once in a while, but probably not because who really likes the stuff anyway? I will no longer identify myself as an alcoholic, but the fundamental principles of meaningful connections with others and a fulfilling home, work and personal life are the things which keep me content and a long distance away from alcohol.

Big love to all out there, and that you to this sub for helping me recovery from my recovery in AA.",2,1742224901.0,recoverywithoutAA,2,0.67,False

I started at a hostel for struggeling young adults a few weeks ago. When I arrived at the intake the manager told me there is no toloration for sexual harrasment. I was very happy she said that. On my trial week everything was fine. When I officially joined however I was immidietly asked if I have a boyfriend by a 27 year old man. I'm 19. When I said no he asked me if I want to be his girlfriend. I was polite and said I dont know you well enough. We didnt talk for the rest of the day. The next day I was sitting next to him playing on my computer. He grunted to get my attention, he asked me to be his girlfriend again and I once again declined. I told my new friends about it and they said ""He asks all the girls he will back off eventually"" He sent me messages on whatapp the second I was added to the hostel group and got my number. over the next couple of weeks he would follow me around, I told the staff who asked him to stop and he didnt. When I would go to the smoking area he would follow (he doesnt smoke) when I would get up he got up. He watched me get out of the shower. He tried to call me. I sent him a very angry message to stop, he didnt. This whole time he was stalking my friend too. Doing the exact same thing to her. She too sent him a message to stop. We both blocked him. He stalked her social media. I dont use my real name so he didnt find mine. Every time we told the staff they said they would deal with it but nothing changed. On friday a social worker from the hostel told us to go to the police. Yesterday we did. We went to the police station the next city over. The police didnt have a translator for my friend who only speaks English so they told us to go to court to get an emergency restraining order, when we talked to the judge we showed her evedence we gathered and she asked why the staff didnt deal with it in the 6 years hes been here (for 6 years he has been harrasing and stalking women. He even pulled down his pants a few years back and told a woman to suck his you know what according to the) we said we were just as confused. The judge wanted the name of a staff member that could come to court next week, we told her about the social worker. Lets call her Diane. The judge asked for Dianes last name, we didnt know so the judge gave us permision to call her. My friend called Diane, she told her her last name but also shouted at her for getting her involved. We were very confused. She told us to go to the police. Why wouldnt she agree to get involved. We get the restraining order and are told by the judge to go back to the police station so an officer can bring him his copy of the restraining order, we were worried the staff would retaliate against us. When we got to the police station we explained the situation to the police officer that sent us to court earlier that day. She called the hostel but there was no answer. She called again, no answer. She called specific staff that we had their number and they kept telling the officer to call someone else. She eventually talked to Diane who lied to the police saying when the creep was asked by the staff to stop he stopped which was not true. He did not stop. The officer didnt belive her lie. The officer said they need to get the creep out of the hostel because we have a restraining order. They refused. We were at the station for hours. Until the police and the hostel finally came to the agreement that if he tries to come anywhere near us we call the police and he gets arrested. We arrive back and I'm told by my case worker that if I dont move out of my friends room one of us is gonna move to another hostel in the branch. They were gonna kick one of us out because we were scared of a creep so stayed in a room together. They were not even going to consider kicking a creep out for stalking and harrassing every woman to set foot into the hostel. I was pissed and walked right out of his office. I told my friend what happened and she too was pissed. This morning I was woken up by my case worker because I needed to cleen the coffee station, he then wanted to talk with me about yesterday and I refused. He came to my friends room and told her were not allowed to talk about the situation anymore, he tried to tell me the same thing and I ignored him. He said that if I'm not gonna cooprate with the staff I can go home. So I said I would. I took my bag and asked for my pills for the week. The staff member gave me my pillbox and told me my case manager says I can come back any time. I'm gonna go back tomorrow night so I can go to the police station on wednesday and on sunday after court Ill pack my stuff and leave for good. I cancelled the monthly payments. I'm done. Btw I tried calling the manager and texting her while we were basically trapped at the police station and she ignored me.

Hey MaximizeMe fam! 👋

Alright, who here is **NOT a morning person?** 🙋‍♀️ Listen, if you're anything like me, you've tried everything from chugging coffee to those intense morning routines that make you feel guilty for hitting snooze. Spoiler alert: I'm still not the ""up by 5 AM"" kinda person, and guess what? That's totally okay!

If you’ve been battling against your natural energy rhythms, maybe it’s time to *stop fighting the tide* and start riding the wave. Here's how I flipped the script and found myself with an extra 10 hours a week!

### **1. Time Blocking... But Make It Personal**

We’ve all heard about time blocking, right? You assign specific time slots to specific tasks. But what if you’re blocking time when you’re half-asleep? *Useless.*

- **Identify your energy peaks:** For me, afternoons are gold. Mornings? Not so much. 
- **Block hours for deep work during natural highs:** I save creative tasks for afternoons when I'm buzzing with energy.
- **Routine is key, but so is flexibility:** Some days you just need to shuffle things around. 🤷‍♂️

### **2. Listen to Your Body**

Ever notice how some tasks just *flow* when you do them at certain times? Listen up:

- **Creative work when you're energized = WIN!** For me, it's 2 PM when the mental fog clears like magic.
- **Declutter your mind during lull times:** I use low energy slots for mundane tasks like emails and admin work. It’s less challenging and keeps me productive even when I'm not feeling it.

### **3. Embrace the Lazy Mornings**

Let’s bash that age-old myth, shall we? Mornings don’t have to be a productivity war zone.

- **Ease into your day.** I start with something fun or soothing – maybe a podcast that's not about hustling but learning or those warm-up stretches you always skip.
- **Ditch the guilt.** You’re not lazy; you’re just smart. You're conserving brain juice for when it counts.

### **4. Experiment and Audit**

You can’t manage what you don’t measure. Try this:

- **Track your energy and productivity:** Notice patterns over a week or two. You'll start seeing those energy peaks and valleys.
- **Tweak and repeat:** It's like a science project, minus the lab coat!

Funny thing is, once I let go of trying to fit my square peg self into a round early-bird corporate hole, my productivity skyrocketed. 🎉 More time, less burnout.

**What about you guys?** What's your secret sauce in managing your time and energy? Would love to hear your stories or even your hilarious morning fails!

1jdf2je,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1jdf2je/the_elevator_part_1_the_descent/,The Elevator Part 1: The Descent,"Emily sat in her office chair, typing endlessly. The due date was approaching and she couldn't risk being late again. She stopped typing for a moment, stretched her fingers and rubbed her eyes. Leaning back in her worn out office chair, she looked at the picture on the corner of her desk. It was a picture of her ex husband and her three year old daughter, Dayla. Emily took out her phone and viewed the text messages. Still no reply for her ex. It had been weeks since she had seen Dayla and she longed to see her. David could care less. After a three year relationship, it ended in failure. David had moved on effortlessly, and that would have been fine with Emily, if David didn’t have a piece of her, Dayla. Emily shrugged the thought from her mind and returned her gaze back to the screen. Her gaze then averted to the hallway window when she heard the sound of chatter. It was her stuck up boss, Ramsy, talking to Elen, a coworker in the office adjacent to her. Emily hated Ramsy. He was constantly on her back and she knew she couldn't miss this upcoming due date. That prick made it clear it would be the last time. Elen laughed at something Ramsy said. That hypocritical laugh Emily knew well. Elen was a pleaser. That's how she got that promotion from Ramsy, not to mention other things she did with Ramsy after work hours.

Emily felt disgusted. She’d never stoop down to Elen’s level. She had respect for herself. Before they walked off, Ramsy glanced at Emily. Emily didn’t see it but she didn’t need to. She felt it. 

“Fuck you Ramsy” Emily said to herself, under her breath. 

Emily grabbed her coffee flask and gulped down. She needed that energy. She would stay late if necessary, but she wasn't going to miss that deadline. She wouldn't give Ramsy the satisfaction of firing her.



Hours passed and finally, she did it. It was done. 



“Maybe being an Uber driver isn't a bad idea after all” Emily thought to herself. 

She chuckled at the thought. She was joking, of course. Working in this office was hectic, yes, but at least there she had one prick to deal with. As an uber driver, she’d have to deal with several, self entitled, pricks  every day, or worse. A few days ago, an uber driver, a single mother of two, was kidnapped and murdered by her passenger. No, Emily wouldn't be considering Uber as an alternative any time soon. She looked at the time on her phone. It was eleven-thirty-six. Emily leaned back in her office chair, stretched her arms above her head and let out a sigh. She slipped on her black heel shoes and got up from her seat. She put her phone in her purse, grabbed her empty coffee flask and proceeded to leave her work area. As she exited into the hallway, she gazed down the hall. It was dark. It was her first time working this late, so she was unfamiliar with how dark the halls could get when the office lights were off. The only light visible was that of the elevator located at the end of the hall. Its light, like a beacon of safety and comfort in a dark void of nothingness. Emily clutched onto the strap of her purse tightly. She felt uneasy. Something about the darkness unsettled her, but she didn’t know why. She began to walk slowly down the hall. Suddenly it hit her. Emily shuffled through her purse and pulled out her phone. She turned on its light.

“That's better…” she thought to herself.

Emily continued at a faster pace, more confidently. The sound of her high heel shoes, fast paced tapping echoing through the hall. Suddenly she stopped. The tapping sound replaced by silence. Emily felt uneasy. The type of feeling that makes your hairs stand up. She felt it up her spine. Emily turned around, the narrow beam of her phone light cutting through the darkness but she saw nothing, but still the uneasy feeling persisted. 

Emily turned back around and continued to walk towards the elevator. 

“A grown woman scared of the dark. Scared of nothing” she chastised herself. “I’ll be home soon”.



After what felt longer than what it should, she finally made it inside the elevator, embraced by its comforting light. She let out a sigh of relief while still clutching onto her purse strap. She turned off the phone’s light, and with the hand that she held her phone, she pressed the elevator button. The elevator made a ding sound and then the doors closed. The elevator made its familiar humming sound as it started its descent. Emily leaned against the wall of the elevator. She closed her eyes and tried to unwind and release all of that silly tension. She took a deep breath as she gazed up at the elevator’s position indicator, watching the numbers descend. 

Suddenly, Emily’s peace of mind was interrupted by the elevator coming to an abrupt stop. Emily, almost losing her balance, grabbed the railing of the elevator. 

“Oh you gotta be kidding me” Emily said, as she looked around the elevator, aggravated by the fact her smooth trip home was being delayed by this random inconvenience.

Emily waited, staring at the metallic elevator door and listened. Other than her own breathing, she heard nothing. Emily went towards the elevator control panel and pressed the emergency button. Nothing happened. That's odd, Emily thought. Shouldn't something be activated when the emergency button is pressed? A light turning on? A voice over the intercom. Anything?

Emily eyed the control panel carefully, but saw nothing other than the floor buttons, the open and shut button and emergency button. She had pressed the emergency button. That's all she had to do, right?

Emily leaned against the wall of the elevator looking at the door, and waited.

Then it hit her. It was late Friday night. 

“Do employees work on Friday nights?” Emily thought to herself. “Oh great, this had to happen on a friday night of all nights!” Emilly thought to herself, irritated. Maybe nobody’s in the building so pressing the emergency button would do no good. Or maybe it wasn't working? Although uncertain, the thought built anxiety in her, increasing the gravity of the situation. Frantically, Emily proceeded to unlock her phone.  While trying to keep her hand from shaking, Emily dilled the emergency number 9-1-1. To make matters worse, her phone screen displayed two words that made matters worse. “no connection”.

“Fuck!”

What if the emergency button didn’t work? What if it was faulty? What if no one knew she was here?

Emily tried again, and again, and again. Nothing. There was no cellular connection. Desperate, Emily held her phone up while moving around the small enclosure, hoping to get a connection. But it was no use. Emilly then began banging on the elevator door.

“Help, help, i'm in here, help” she yelled.

After banging on the elevator door until the pals of her hands became sore, she listened. She heard silence. Nothing but silence.



Eventually, she gave up, and sat down on the elevator floor, back against the wall. Looking up she saw the white elevator light, just one in the center of the ceiling, illuminating the small enclosure. Emily stared at her phone's home screen, looking at the background photo of her and her daughter. A tear trailed down her face, as she realized that her phone's battery would run out soon. She thought she had charged the phone, but the charger must have been unplugged. She was too busy working on her due assignment to notice. Time passed. The battery logo started flashing. Hopelessly, Emily stared at the phone screen, looking at a picture of her daughter that was set on the phone's wallpaper. She watched as the face of her daughter disappeared when the phone's screen fades to black and the phone powered off. It was dead. Time passed as Emily sat with her back against the wall, just staring at the elevator door. Emily didn't know long she'd been trapped. Minutes? Hours? Maybe a day?

“Maybe I should try again,” she thought. “Just one more time”'. 

Although exhausted, the stress of the situation made her move. She got up, and banged and yelled.

Once again she was met with nothing. Her ears hurt from her own yelling amplified by the small space.

Suddenly to her shock, a knock was heard, disturbing the silence like a sudden turbulence disturbing a peaceful flight. Startled Emily stood back, eyes opened wide, staring at the elevator door. She stared in disbelief. Was it her imagination?

“Hello” Emily said, unsure of herself, half not knowing what to expect.

She stood still, listening and eyes locked on the door. No response or follow up knock was heard. Emily walked up to the elevator door, and placed her ear against the cool metallic surface and held her breath. To her shock, she heard a voice. Four words were heard from the other side of the 3 inch metallic door.

“Do you see us?”

Shocked, Emilly stepped back away from the door. Before she had time to process what she heard, the elevator's ceiling light started to flicker, and then the elevator abruptly started to speed downward as if free falling. Losing her balance, Emily curled up in the elevator's coroner, and held onto the railing. 

The light continued to flicker uncontrollably, sending the elevator interior in and out of total darkness. To Emilies horror, in the flickering light, she could see three lanky humanoid beings, tall and dark like translucent shadows, with notable wright purple eyes. They looked down at her as their figures seemed to twist and contort like static on an analog tv.  Emily sat curled up in the corner, staring back at them in disbelief, looking into their sunken bright purple eyes. 

Suddenly the elevator went dark and came to an abrupt stop. The door opened…

I'm 27F, 272lbs 5' 5'', and feeling overwhelmed about where to start again with weight loss. I’ve been pescatarian (not open to reed meats/poultry) for a while now, and I do my best to stay under 1200 cals/day (max probably 1500). I drink *ocassionally*, maybe a glass or 2 of wine a week. I might have a diet coke every now and then, I don't drink a sugary coffee - a 8oz latte here and there.

On paper I'm healthy. No auto-immune diseases, high blood pressure/cholesterol etc... low sodium if anything. I work from home half the week, but the other three days I’m a server in a busy restaurant where I'm on my feet for 7-hour shifts.

I struggled with an eating disorder from ages 13-21, where I was undereating/starving myself. Since then, I've worked hard to improve my relationship with food. I haven’t gotten back to the gym because I often feel too tired when I’m not working, still struggle with depression.

I really want to lose weight in a sustainable, healthy way, but I’m unsure what steps to take next. Any advice on workout routines, energy-boosting strategies, or meal planning?

1jdexza,https://www.reddit.com/r/alltimelow/comments/1jdexza/im_a_newish_fan_just_sharing_thoughts_on_their/,I'm a newish fan just sharing thoughts on their albums,"About 5 years ago I found ATL when Once In a Lifetime came out (which I'm sad never made it to an album) and I became obsessed with that song which led me to the songs Dear Maria, Weightless, Old Scars/Future Hearts, Guts, Backseat Serenade,  & Break Your Little Heart. A little after that time I listened to Wake Up Sunshine (btw seeing the love for this album on this sub is awesome.) Until last summer I never branched past those tracks, although I knew that I loved this band. Last summer, I found Nothing Personal on CD at a thrift store, and it was the perfect gateway to get me diving into their music. I have been really enjoying stalking this sub because the community seems really cool and I just wanted to share my random thoughts as a newer fan who still hasn't listened to all their records.

My top 3 albums as of now are Nothing Personal, Wake Up Sunshine, & Don't Panic. I am absolutely obsessed with Coffee Shop Soundtrack, but unfortunately, that is the only song that really grabbed me from that album (not that the others songs are bad, just none stood out to me as much). Although I do think I need to revisit it. On first listen of SWIR, I did not particularly love it which I was not expecting because of how perfect Dear Maria is. I am on my third listen and I definitely like it more, but I would still not put it up with my favorites, not even close. I think that LYR is really good, it's just not the type of music I am particularly into so I can't imagine revisiting it much. With Future Hearts, it's just hit or miss. Some songs I really love, others are forgettable to me (Old Scars/Future Hearts is still a fav). WUS & TMIA are both amazing albums and it is crazy how they have developed their sound in a way that still works as these albums I think stand among their best. Dirty Work is the only album I have yet to listen to, and I see mixed things about it on this sub. I really like Guts, Time-bomb, & JTWIN so I think I will enjoy it. Based on those songs alone, I do not see it becoming a favorite & I think my top 3 albums will stand for a long time. Lastly, PMA & Once In A Lifetime are two of my favs from them and I wish they went on an album. After stalking this sub, I think it's so cool to see how almost every album is someone's favorite, and it always totally makes sense. Thanks if you read this farXD

1jdetik,https://i.redd.it/5oexghzam9pe1.jpeg,I analyzed Reddit for the 10 most recommended electric coffee grinders on r/pourover,"I’ve been doing analysis on reddit data and was looking at the most recommended electric coffee grinders on r/pourover. Thought I’d share the results.

Its part of a side project of mine to tinker with Reddit data and LLMs. My goal was to create something useful for the community while practicing my dev skills.

The analysis aims to highlight the most well reviewed electric coffee grinders - a very rough proxy for what’s widely considered the best electric coffee grinders. Hopefully it is a useful data point for those overwhelmed by all the information out there.

Methodology: 

I used Google and Reddit search (filtered for the past year for freshness) to source for discussions on electric coffee grinders in r/pourover. From the top results I analyzed a total of 61 relevant threads and used LLMs to extract opinions and perform sentiment analysis.

To rank the models, I calculated the normalized difference and ratio between the no. of positive and negative user sentiments, and used that to determine the final score for ranking.

Handling and merging different model namings, brands, abbreviations etc is non trivial so a 100% LLM approach wasn’t sufficient. I did some eyeballing and manual clean up but there may still be mistakes. Let me know if you spot anything wrong or surprising.

For those interested in, the source data (i.e. comments analyzed) and individual sentiment analysis can be found on RedditRecs dot com (or google RedditRecs)w",36,1742223957.0,pourover,31,0.93,False

I did meet my ex-wife for coffee. I will refer to her by her initial “M.” It was pleasant. She kept inviting me to dinner, which I refused at first. But we kept meeting for coffee and we went on long walks and hikes.  I really enjoyed it. But I made it clear that I wanted to take things slowly. Finally, after she invited me to dinner, I did agree but with the condition that I help shop for the groceries and help with the food prep. It was a great date. We decided that we would try again. We had long talks about the affair and her betrayal and the effect it had on me. She offered all sorts of things to give me confidence and to alleviate my anxiety.

As an example, I mentioned that I had some anxiety about  her work holiday party. It's not that I didn't trust her, but I knew that her male drunken co-workers would be hitting on her.  i thought that she would just re-assure me, but she immediately said she would not attend the party.

Communication was key for us. When i had intrusive thoughts, we would talk about them. When she experienced feelings of self-hatred and shame, we would talk about them. Each of us continue with our individual therapy. We have regular couples counseling. We have regular check-ins.

She asked her parents if she could bring “a guy she started seeing” to their family Christmas Eve celebration. It was quite a surprise when they saw me. I really love her family and was so happy to celebrate with them.

My family was a different story. While they loved her while we were together, they felt negatively when I told them that she had an affair.

 So when I told them that we were reconciling, that were shocked and not happy. They thought I was making a mistake. M went to them and apologized. She was literally shaking. After she apologized, she excused herself to go to the rest room, and I went to check on her. She was on the floor crying. It was painful. my parents might not feel about her the way they did before, but they are at least polite now.

Things were going great. We were talking about moving in together and maybe an eventual re-marriage.

But within the last two weeks, I have become indecisive. Before my “intrusive thoughts” were about the cause of my pain. Like “how could you have done that to me?”

But now, I am more focused on the effect of her betrayal. After I discovered the affair, and up until I called her to tell her that I forgave her, I was in the depths of despair. People on this sub know the feeling of going to sleep at night and praying that you don't wake up again. While I am in great spirits now and quite happy, it is like Tom Waits said: it is “a wound that will never heal.” It's like she took an axe and cut off my legs. I know she is very remorseful, but every day I look down and see that my legs are gone. And that she is the one who chopped them off. Does that make sense? 

So I told M that I need some time of no contact so that I can decide what I want to do. She was very upset, which I understand. I do love her. But I need this period of discerment. It will be at least 30 days, maybe longer. I truly want to be with her, and I love her, and I hope that at the end of this period of discernment, I decide that I want to be with her. She has done everything right. After everything that happened, I do trust her. But sometimes, some wounds just run too deep.

i think I am going to take some vacation time and book a trip. I have this overwhelming desire to be outdoors - in nature, hiking or kayaking. Hopefully that will help me make the correct decision.

I'm a writer and artist. I've been writing some stories for a comic series and recently been stuck on how to progress. Last week I bought a pack of cigs for the first time in years and no joke, I had one cigarette and I managed to unravel the knot of stories I had. I finished the cigarette and my mind was on fire and with so many ideas that I managed to solve my story issues. In the days since I got the pack I've written 6-7 more stories. I'll literally be smoking or sitting in nature after having a smoke and an idea will pop up. And then another idea, and then another story, as if by divine revelation. Tobacco is a super mind altering drug that expands the mind. I'm convinced of it.

Looking at the long list of smokers that are great writers from Mark Twain to Tolkien to Stephen King and others I've made my mind that tobacco is an enhancer of the creative process due to the chemical component of nicotine. Shit literally gives you super powers and makes it hard to quit because of this enhancement and unlike alcohol it doesn't alter the mind in a detrimental manner. You can stay sober and alert. This makes it a dangerous combination. I just had my morning cigarette with coffee and I'm so peaceful with all of my day arranged and planned out in an organized way despite my usual ADHD knot of daily goals. The knot is neatly placed, unraveled into a single piece of string, in my brain. This is powerful. So much so that I'm convinced that a writer that smokes gets an edge over a writer that doesn't. However, it comes at an obvious cost.

1jdeouq,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1jdeouq/the_elevator_part_1_the_descent/,The Elevator Part 1: The Descent,"Emily sat in her office chair, typing endlessly. The due date was approaching and she couldn't risk being late again. She stopped typing for a moment, stretched her fingers and rubbed her eyes. Leaning back in her worn out office chair, she looked at the picture on the corner of her desk. It was a picture of her ex husband and her three year old daughter, Dayla. Emily took out her phone and viewed the text messages. Still no reply for her ex. It had been weeks since she had seen Dayla and she longed to see her. David could care less. After a three year relationship, it ended in failure. David had moved on effortlessly, and that would have been fine with Emily, if David didn’t have a piece of her, Dayla. Emily shrugged the thought from her mind and returned her gaze back to the screen. Her gaze then averted to the hallway window when she heard the sound of chatter. It was her stuck up boss, Ramsy, talking to Elen, a coworker in the office adjacent to her. Emily hated Ramsy. He was constantly on her back and she knew she couldn't miss this upcoming due date. That prick made it clear it would be the last time. Elen laughed at something Ramsy said. That hypocritical laugh Emily knew well. Elen was a pleaser. That's how she got that promotion from Ramsy, not to mention other things she did with Ramsy after work hours.

Emily felt disgusted. She’d never stoop down to Elen’s level. She had respect for herself. Before they walked off, Ramsy glanced at Emily. Emily didn’t see it but she didn’t need to. She felt it. 

“Fuck you Ramsy” Emily said to herself, under her breath. 

Emily grabbed her coffee flask and gulped down. She needed that energy. She would stay late if necessary, but she wasn't going to miss that deadline. She wouldn't give Ramsy the satisfaction of firing her.

Hours passed and finally, she did it. It was done. 

“Maybe being an Uber driver isn't a bad idea after all” Emily thought to herself. 

She chuckled at the thought. She was joking, of course. Working in this office was hectic, yes, but at least there she had one prick to deal with. As an uber driver, she’d have to deal with several, self entitled, pricks  every day, or worse. A few days ago, an uber driver, a single mother of two, was kidnapped and murdered by her passenger. No, Emily wouldn't be considering Uber as an alternative any time soon. She looked at the time on her phone. It was eleven-thirty-six. Emily leaned back in her office chair, stretched her arms above her head and let out a sigh. She slipped on her black heel shoes and got up from her seat. She put her phone in her purse, grabbed her empty coffee flask and proceeded to leave her work area. As she exited into the hallway, she gazed down the hall. It was dark. It was her first time working this late, so she was unfamiliar with how dark the halls could get when the office lights were off. The only light visible was that of the elevator located at the end of the hall. Its light, like a beacon of safety and comfort in a dark void of nothingness. Emily clutched onto the strap of her purse tightly. She felt uneasy. Something about the darkness unsettled her, but she didn’t know why. She began to walk slowly down the hall. Suddenly it hit her. Emily shuffled through her purse and pulled out her phone. She turned on its light.

“That's better…” she thought to herself.

Emily continued at a faster pace, more confidently. The sound of her high heel shoes, fast paced tapping echoing through the hall. Suddenly she stopped. The tapping sound replaced by silence. Emily felt uneasy. The type of feeling that makes your hairs stand up. She felt it up her spine. Emily turned around, the narrow beam of her phone light cutting through the darkness but she saw nothing, but still the uneasy feeling persisted. 

Emily turned back around and continued to walk towards the elevator. 

“A grown woman scared of the dark. Scared of nothing” she chastised herself. “I’ll be home soon”.

After what felt longer than what it should, she finally made it inside the elevator, embraced by its comforting light. She let out a sigh of relief while still clutching onto her purse strap. She turned off the phone’s light, and with the hand that she held her phone, she pressed the elevator button. The elevator made a ding sound and then the doors closed. The elevator made its familiar humming sound as it started its descent. Emily leaned against the wall of the elevator. She closed her eyes and tried to unwind and release all of that silly tension. She took a deep breath as she gazed up at the elevator’s position indicator, watching the numbers descend. 

Suddenly, Emily’s peace of mind was interrupted by the elevator coming to an abrupt stop. Emily, almost losing her balance, grabbed the railing of the elevator. 

“Oh you gotta be kidding me” Emily said, as she looked around the elevator, aggravated by the fact her smooth trip home was being delayed by this random inconvenience.

Emily waited, staring at the metallic elevator door and listened. Other than her own breathing, she heard nothing. Emily went towards the elevator control panel and pressed the emergency button. Nothing happened. That's odd, Emily thought. Shouldn't something be activated when the emergency button is pressed? A light turning on? A voice over the intercom. Anything?

Emily eyed the control panel carefully, but saw nothing other than the floor buttons, the open and shut button and emergency button. She had pressed the emergency button. That's all she had to do, right?

Emily leaned against the wall of the elevator looking at the door, and waited.

Then it hit her. It was late Friday night. 

“Do employees work on Friday nights?” Emily thought to herself. “Oh great, this had to happen on a friday night of all nights!” Emilly thought to herself, irritated. Maybe nobody’s in the building so pressing the emergency button would do no good. Or maybe it wasn't working? Although uncertain, the thought built anxiety in her, increasing the gravity of the situation. Frantically, Emily proceeded to unlock her phone.  While trying to keep her hand from shaking, Emily dilled the emergency number 9-1-1. To make matters worse, her phone screen displayed two words that made matters worse. “no connection”.

“Fuck!”

What if the emergency button didn’t work? What if it was faulty? What if no one knew she was here?

Emily tried again, and again, and again. Nothing. There was no cellular connection. Desperate, Emily held her phone up while moving around the small enclosure, hoping to get a connection. But it was no use. Emilly then began banging on the elevator door.

“Help, help, i'm in here, help” she yelled.

After banging on the elevator door until the pals of her hands became sore, she listened. She heard silence. Nothing but silence.

Eventually, she gave up, and sat down on the elevator floor, back against the wall. Looking up she saw the white elevator light, just one in the center of the ceiling, illuminating the small enclosure. Emily stared at her phone's home screen, looking at the background photo of her and her daughter. A tear trailed down her face, as she realized that her phone's battery would run out soon. She thought she had charged the phone, but the charger must have been unplugged. She was too busy working on her due assignment to notice. Time passed. The battery logo started flashing. Hopelessly, Emily stared at the phone screen, looking at a picture of her daughter that was set on the phone's wallpaper. She watched as the face of her daughter disappeared when the phone's screen fades to black and the phone powered off. It was dead. Time passed as Emily sat with her back against the wall, just staring at the elevator door. Emily didn't know long she'd been trapped. Minutes? Hours? Maybe a day?

“Maybe I should try again,” she thought. “Just one more time”'. 

Although exhausted, the stress of the situation made her move. She got up, and banged and yelled.

Once again she was met with nothing. Her ears hurt from her own yelling amplified by the small space.

Suddenly to her shock, a knock was heard, disturbing the silence like a sudden turbulence disturbing a peaceful flight. Startled Emily stood back, eyes opened wide, staring at the elevator door. She stared in disbelief. Was it her imagination?

“Hello” Emily said, unsure of herself, half not knowing what to expect.

She stood still, listening and eyes locked on the door. No response or follow up knock was heard. Emily walked up to the elevator door, and placed her ear against the cool metallic surface and held her breath. To her shock, she heard a voice. Four words were heard from the other side of the 3 inch metallic door.

“Do you see us?”

Shocked, Emilly stepped back away from the door. Before she had time to process what she heard, the elevator's ceiling light started to flicker, and then the elevator abruptly started to speed downward as if free falling. Losing her balance, Emily curled up in the elevator's coroner, and held onto the railing. 

The light continued to flicker uncontrollably, sending the elevator interior in and out of total darkness. To Emilies horror, in the flickering light, she could see three lanky humanoid beings, tall and dark like translucent shadows, with notable wright purple eyes. They looked down at her as their figures seemed to twist and contort like static on an analog tv.  Emily sat curled up in the corner, staring back at them in disbelief, looking into their sunken bright purple eyes. 

Suddenly the elevator went dark and came to an abrupt stop. The door opened…

1jdeo99,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jdeo99,I was 9dpo when something odd happened...,"I woke up at 3:30am last Friday morning. Had my coffee as usual.
Husband got up and left for work just before 6am.
Just after he left, I went to use the bathroom and when I got up, I immediately felt my right breast swell up. 
I thought it was odd, so I let me husband know.
Not 5 minutes later, it started hurting a little.
Then my arm felt like it was going numb.
Then came the intense pain. 
I got in touch with my surgeon to tell him I'm  going to the ER. I'm crying on the phone with him and since he's 1.5 hours away, he sent me to his partner, who is only 30 minutes from me instead of the ER. He says it might be a hematoma.
The pain is so bad now, all I can do is holler. It feels like my breast grew 10x bigger. The swelling is in my armpit and up to my collarbone. 
Husband rushed home and we made our way to the office. I hollered the whole ride. I thought I was going to literally explode. The pain is moving to my back and neck now.
My breathing is labored but shallow. I feel like I'm being smothered.
We make it to the office and finally get back to a room. I'm still hollering and probably scarring everyone. This is the absolute worst pain I've ever been in. 
They tell me it's definitely a hematoma and give me an iv to finally knock me out.
He goes in through my previous incision to clean my breast out.
I wake up feeling SO MUCH better. 
First 2 photos are while it was swelling up and in one pic, I'm marking the top of the implant with my fingers. Last 2 are after they cleaned it out.
Oh, and my surgeon said it's very odd that a hematoma happened this far out! We aren't sure what caused it, BUT I can't help but wonder...the day before, I had my 1 week post op followup and he showed me how to massage my breasts and he did it pretty hard! It hurt, but I assume that's normal?

Just glad that's over and I can finally finish healing! I'm still massaging them, just not as aggressive as he did it!

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Anyway here are all the symptoms I get:

- heart feeling like it skips a beat or stops for a second when I'm sitting or laying

- I get easily exhausted when running even for a bit which causes my heart to beat strongly

- sometimes when I'm about to fall asleep my heart will skip or speed up which causes me to get jolted awake, this makes it hard to sleep because sometimes it happens multiple times in a row until I can finally fall asleep


These symptoms are pretty minor overall but it still worries me because I'm only 14, so does anyone have any solution as to what this might be? I'm gonna tell my parents more about this and hopefully get it checked out",1,1742223594.0,Heartpalpitations,0,1.0,False
1jdeo1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesome/comments/1jdeo1w/i_am_now_the_office_young_people_expertand_i_love/,I am now the office 'Young People' expert....and I love it.,"So I(38F) work in an office of mostly folks in their late 30s and 40s...me included. The only big difference is that I am one of the few who doesn't have kids ( I am a DINK). Now unlike the horror stories I hear on Reddit, my coworkers are great and they never make their kids anyone else's issue. I actually love hearing about their weekends and seeing adorable photos on the community boards on Teams. Its a nice environment to work in.

Having worked for the business for over a decade I have cultivated a reputation for being cheerful, hardworking, energetic---and a bit childish. When I say 'Childish' I mean that I like often like kid-oriented media. I will perk up when someone says their kid is playing a certain game or someone will notice my one of my coffee mugs durning a Teams meeting and ask about the cartoon character on it. 

You see, my partner and I both love all forms of media and are not prejudicial based on who the media was originally targeted for. We will happily watch a string of gory horror films followed up with a few episodes of *Bluey.* The last three games on my Deck played were *Binding of Issac, Outer Worlds* and *Dreamlight Valley.* This year so far I read two Stephen King books and reread the *Percy Jackson* series. This is just to show that while I enjoy adult-oriented media I will watch/play/listen/read anything if people say it has value and a good story.

So this reputation has created an interesting side effect. I now have people calling/DMing me with questions to help them better understand their kids. Here are some examples:

* Woman with a rather shy pre-teen daughter was asking about books for her birthday. She sent me a photo of her daughter's book shelf and I could see there was a related series to one of the ones the daughter had so I recommended it. The daughter absolutely love it. 
* I have a guy who calls me to ask all about the new *Pokémon* games and how to play for his young son. He knows I have played every title so he comes with a list of questions from his kid to ask ( I am now the 'Pokémon Lady' at his dad's job). I know he could google it but he appreciates that I explain in a way he can understand. It is adorable that he carefully writes down my answers so he can help his son later. 
* Slang - At least once a week I get an DM asking me to explain some meme, slang or Youtube thing. It is mostly funny until a lady asked (NSFW) >!what 'Gooning' was ( Hired Goons!) !<That was an awkward one....but we had a good laugh.
* Movie Checks - My husband and I watch a lot of films so we have usually seen every major thing that has come out. I often get asked about sensitivities, such as animal distress or blood for their kids who might get scared. I also use this as a way to recommend other, less well-known movies and shows. 

This is just to say that I love the people at my job. It makes me happy to see parents actively trying to understand their kids better and connect with them. I also like that they in no way judge me for my interests...they see it as a strength!

Have a great day folks!

1jdej5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/sciencefiction/comments/1jdej5l/flying_south_for_the_winter/,Flying South for the Winter,"There was no point to any of it. Work, survival, the illusion of progress—just an endless loop, a fleeting Ouroboros built by the uncaring egos of the upper echelon.

Sixty-hour weeks, performance reviews, forced small talk over stale coffee, all culminating in the grand reward: More work! The pizza party of corporate climbing. And now? A transfer to some humid backwater where the air felt like wet cement and the bugs were bigger than his ambition.

The golden tapestry of a new day opened with feigned hope, a cruel joke played by the universe. Sunrise wasn’t a promise—it was a reminder he had to do it all over again.

Every day was the same, except for the television’s blue hue pulsing brighter as news anchors murmured about anomalies in the sky—extraterrestrial sightings that defied familiar depictions, their forms obscured in grainy footage and distressed eyewitness accounts. The world churned with speculation, but Jim barely paid attention. What was one more crisis in a long list of existential threats?

""We should go to the party, Jimmy. It'll be a good chance for you to network with people from work.""

Susan had spent twelve years trying to make the best of their situation, believing against divorce. And all Jim could do was roll his eyes, already bracing for the inevitable remarks: Opposites sure do attract.

She was animated, bubbly, spinning story after story, filling silences with an encyclopedia’s worth of details about his life. That’s how people learned more than they needed to about him—his opinions, his habits, even his secrets—spilled into the world just to combat awkwardness. She never seemed to realize her overcompensation only made it worse, stretching conversations until they frayed, until people drifted toward the quiet corner of Jim's domain, finding new appreciation for his standoffishness.

And then there was him—haggard, cranky, keeping to himself.

""Why would I want to do that?"" Jim scoffed, staring down at the untouched coffee in his mug. ""I already see them sixty hours a week. They know me better than I know myself. And I certainly know them even better—because if they were any good at their jobs, I wouldn’t have been sent here to fix this mess.""

""Well, it’s a good thing the company is paying you a hefty bonus.""

""Yeah, great, sweetheart. You know what would make it even better? If the world ended tomorrow and all that money was only good for wallpaper, keeping warm at night, or cooking your ravishing dinners.""

Susan forced a smile, biting her tongue. When Jim called her sweetheart, he had already resigned himself to going where she wanted. If she argued back, he’d isolate in his study instead—a bastion of avoidance where all headaches went away in a blanket of solace and peace.

The party was worse than expected. Sycophants prattling on about work, dull office politics, hoping Jim would acknowledge their efforts over grilled chicken and cheap beer.

He had drifted in and out of conversation until he settled amongst the more interesting crowd—people whispering about the news, classified documents being leaked, a looming threat in space. A war. A lost home. A search for a planet with water. The invaders wouldn’t come in peace.

Jim’s eyes glazed over. He had heard enough doomsday talk over the years to know how these things went—wild theories, a bit of alcohol, and nothing ever came of it.

Then, even boredom closed out with a bang.

A thunderous crash shattered the night. Glass panes screamed as they fractured, the air itself rippling like disturbed water. The music cut out, replaced by the crackling of energy surging through the atmosphere.

Above them hovered a craft—silver and azure, brilliant and dull, moving to and fro, inside and outside of itself. Both there and not. Reality around it hummed and melted, dripping as if painted by a madman.

From its center formed a pool of radiating liquid, bright and luminous, expanding into a portal that released a golden egg made of countless metallic feathers.

Everyone stood still, bound by the hum—a siren call from a far-off island to those lost in the sea of daily monotony.

Then time gave up its facade, retiring into a perceived eternity.

The egg smashed into the earth, cracking open with a sickening pop. A plume of yellow gas erupted outward, faster than a blink.

The spell was broken.

The air turned rancid—a rotting, sickly-sweet stench, like an abandoned slaughterhouse left to fester.

People screamed, bolting for cover.

But it was useless. One by one, the runners choked and seized, their lungs burning, their muscles spasming. Faces turned red, veins bulging, eyes bulging from sockets as their bodies betrayed them. Streams of snot and bile dripped from their noses before they collapsed.

Jim, along with the others who had refused—or simply lacked the energy—to flee, remained untouched.

The bodies on the ground twisted, cracked, stretched. Flesh rippled and reformed. Clothes tore as bones snapped into new configurations. Feathers sprouted like invasive weeds, pushing through skin as talons curled where hands once were.

Jim whispered under his breath. ""Must be some sort of bird flu.""

One of them, its voice a mixture of squawks and screeches, turned to him.

""Those who run are not worthy. You-man Jimmy will serve. Jim serve. Others too. You shape this planet for us. You understand change. Run and die, serve and be rewarded.""

Wings ripped through what was left of Susan’s clothes, and with a shriek, she soared into the sky. A wave of ships followed.

Jim exhaled sharply, watching the heavens burn. ""Looks like I’m not the only foreigner who headed south. From uncaring bosses who barely acted human... to inhuman masters. One who happened to be my wife. From the fire into the flames.""

Tears welled up in his eyes as he looked up to see her one last time.

But all that remained in the skies were feathers falling, flocking to earth to terraform it to their own designs.

And Jim would clock in tomorrow.

Emily sat in her office chair, typing endlessly. The due date was approaching and she couldn't risk being late again. She stopped typing for a moment, stretched her fingers and rubbed her eyes. Leaning back in her worn out office chair, she looked at the picture on the corner of her desk. It was a picture of her ex husband and her three year old daughter, Dayla. Emily took out her phone and viewed the text messages. Still no reply for her ex. It had been weeks since she had seen Dayla and she longed to see her. David could care less. After a three year relationship, it ended in failure. David had moved on effortlessly, and that would have been fine with Emily, if David didn’t have a piece of her, Dayla. Emily shrugged the thought from her mind and returned her gaze back to the screen. Her gaze then averted to the hallway window when she heard the sound of chatter. It was her stuck up boss, Ramsy, talking to Elen, a coworker in the office adjacent to her. Emily hated Ramsy. He was constantly on her back and she knew she couldn't miss this upcoming due date. That prick made it clear it would be the last time. Elen laughed at something Ramsy said. That hypocritical laugh Emily knew well. Elen was a pleaser. That's how she got that promotion from Ramsy, not to mention other things she did with Ramsy after work hours.

Emily felt disgusted. She’d never stoop down to Elen’s level. She had respect for herself. Before they walked off, Ramsy glanced at Emily. Emily didn’t see it but she didn’t need to. She felt it. 

“Fuck you Ramsy” Emily said to herself, under her breath. 

Emily grabbed her coffee flask and gulped down. She needed that energy. She would stay late if necessary, but she wasn't going to miss that deadline. She wouldn't give Ramsy the satisfaction of firing her.



Hours passed and finally, she did it. It was done. 



“Maybe being an Uber driver isn't a bad idea after all” Emily thought to herself. 

She chuckled at the thought. She was joking, of course. Working in this office was hectic, yes, but at least there she had one prick to deal with. As an uber driver, she’d have to deal with several, self entitled, pricks  every day, or worse. A few days ago, an uber driver, a single mother of two, was kidnapped and murdered by her passenger. No, Emily wouldn't be considering Uber as an alternative any time soon. She looked at the time on her phone. It was eleven-thirty-six. Emily leaned back in her office chair, stretched her arms above her head and let out a sigh. She slipped on her black heel shoes and got up from her seat. She put her phone in her purse, grabbed her empty coffee flask and proceeded to leave her work area. As she exited into the hallway, she gazed down the hall. It was dark. It was her first time working this late, so she was unfamiliar with how dark the halls could get when the office lights were off. The only light visible was that of the elevator located at the end of the hall. Its light, like a beacon of safety and comfort in a dark void of nothingness. Emily clutched onto the strap of her purse tightly. She felt uneasy. Something about the darkness unsettled her, but she didn’t know why. She began to walk slowly down the hall. Suddenly it hit her. Emily shuffled through her purse and pulled out her phone. She turned on its light.

“That's better…” she thought to herself.

Emily continued at a faster pace, more confidently. The sound of her high heel shoes, fast paced tapping echoing through the hall. Suddenly she stopped. The tapping sound replaced by silence. Emily felt uneasy. The type of feeling that makes your hairs stand up. She felt it up her spine. Emily turned around, the narrow beam of her phone light cutting through the darkness but she saw nothing, but still the uneasy feeling persisted. 

Emily turned back around and continued to walk towards the elevator. 

“A grown woman scared of the dark. Scared of nothing” she chastised herself. “I’ll be home soon”.



After what felt longer than what it should, she finally made it inside the elevator, embraced by its comforting light. She let out a sigh of relief while still clutching onto her purse strap. She turned off the phone’s light, and with the hand that she held her phone, she pressed the elevator button. The elevator made a ding sound and then the doors closed. The elevator made its familiar humming sound as it started its descent. Emily leaned against the wall of the elevator. She closed her eyes and tried to unwind and release all of that silly tension. She took a deep breath as she gazed up at the elevator’s position indicator, watching the numbers descend. 

Suddenly, Emily’s peace of mind was interrupted by the elevator coming to an abrupt stop. Emily, almost losing her balance, grabbed the railing of the elevator. 

“Oh you gotta be kidding me” Emily said, as she looked around the elevator, aggravated by the fact her smooth trip home was being delayed by this random inconvenience.

Emily waited, staring at the metallic elevator door and listened. Other than her own breathing, she heard nothing. Emily went towards the elevator control panel and pressed the emergency button. Nothing happened. That's odd, Emily thought. Shouldn't something be activated when the emergency button is pressed? A light turning on? A voice over the intercom. Anything?

Emily eyed the control panel carefully, but saw nothing other than the floor buttons, the open and shut button and emergency button. She had pressed the emergency button. That's all she had to do, right?

Emily leaned against the wall of the elevator looking at the door, and waited.

Then it hit her. It was late Friday night. 

“Do employees work on Friday nights?” Emily thought to herself. “Oh great, this had to happen on a friday night of all nights!” Emilly thought to herself, irritated. Maybe nobody’s in the building so pressing the emergency button would do no good. Or maybe it wasn't working? Although uncertain, the thought built anxiety in her, increasing the gravity of the situation. Frantically, Emily proceeded to unlock her phone.  While trying to keep her hand from shaking, Emily dilled the emergency number 9-1-1. To make matters worse, her phone screen displayed two words that made matters worse. “no connection”.

“Fuck!”

What if the emergency button didn’t work? What if it was faulty? What if no one knew she was here?

Emily tried again, and again, and again. Nothing. There was no cellular connection. Desperate, Emily held her phone up while moving around the small enclosure, hoping to get a connection. But it was no use. Emilly then began banging on the elevator door.

“Help, help, i'm in here, help” she yelled.

After banging on the elevator door until the pals of her hands became sore, she listened. She heard silence. Nothing but silence.



Eventually, she gave up, and sat down on the elevator floor, back against the wall. Looking up she saw the white elevator light, just one in the center of the ceiling, illuminating the small enclosure. Emily stared at her phone's home screen, looking at the background photo of her and her daughter. A tear trailed down her face, as she realized that her phone's battery would run out soon. She thought she had charged the phone, but the charger must have been unplugged. She was too busy working on her due assignment to notice. Time passed. The battery logo started flashing. Hopelessly, Emily stared at the phone screen, looking at a picture of her daughter that was set on the phone's wallpaper. She watched as the face of her daughter disappeared when the phone's screen fades to black and the phone powered off. It was dead. Time passed as Emily sat with her back against the wall, just staring at the elevator door. Emily didn't know long she'd been trapped. Minutes? Hours? Maybe a day?

“Maybe I should try again,” she thought. “Just one more time”'. 

Although exhausted, the stress of the situation made her move. She got up, and banged and yelled.

Once again she was met with nothing. Her ears hurt from her own yelling amplified by the small space.

Suddenly to her shock, a knock was heard, disturbing the silence like a sudden turbulence disturbing a peaceful flight. Startled Emily stood back, eyes opened wide, staring at the elevator door. She stared in disbelief. Was it her imagination?

“Hello” Emily said, unsure of herself, half not knowing what to expect.

She stood still, listening and eyes locked on the door. No response or follow up knock was heard. Emily walked up to the elevator door, and placed her ear against the cool metallic surface and held her breath. To her shock, she heard a voice. Four words were heard from the other side of the 3 inch metallic door.

“Do you see us?”

Shocked, Emilly stepped back away from the door. Before she had time to process what she heard, the elevator's ceiling light started to flicker, and then the elevator abruptly started to speed downward as if free falling. Losing her balance, Emily curled up in the elevator's coroner, and held onto the railing. 

The light continued to flicker uncontrollably, sending the elevator interior in and out of total darkness. To Emilies horror, in the flickering light, she could see three lanky humanoid beings, tall and dark like translucent shadows, with notable wright purple eyes. They looked down at her as their figures seemed to twist and contort like static on an analog tv.  Emily sat curled up in the corner, staring back at them in disbelief, looking into their sunken bright purple eyes. 



Suddenly the elevator went dark and came to an abrupt stop. The door opened…

  


Author’s note- This was the first part of my horror story, “The Elevator” and I’m currently brainstorming the second part. It’s one of my first works so please feel free to let me know what you think. I welcome any suggestions you have.

1jdehb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1jdehb1/managing_living_with_a_roommate/,Managing living with a roommate,"I'm not diagnosed, but I've suspected on and off (accepting that I'm just a stupid weirdo and then coming back to suspect being autistic again) for about 10 years, so maybe I'm just a giant fraud and a wimp or something.

Anyway, I'm currently a year-two university student and this is my second year living with a roommate. There are no student living accommodations my university provides that offer living by one's self. If you didn't a book a room with your friend/friends, you get assigned a random person and the room is tiny. I don't mind the size, I just can't handle the other person aspect.

I can't handle trying to appear normal all the time. And the smells! He doesn't like opening widows, so the room smells every time I come back from campus. He showers like 3 times a week, at most, and the room reeks of sweat all the time. So I always open a window, but then he pulls out his sweater (always the same one) which smells even worse. The air is always stuffy at night.

And he chews so loud, breathes so loud, swallows saliva very loudly. All of his meals have strong smells, his coffee has such a strong smell. All of that mixes together, and the window stays closed until I come back from the campus.

His routine is so inconsistent too! I can't predict when he'll be here or not. Sometimes he's missing for three days straight, and sometimes he won't leave the room for 2 days straight. And some days, he comes back at 2 AM, some days at 4 AM. I can't figure it out. There hasn't been a single two-week period where he had the same schedule.

Whenever he's here, all the smells, all those sounds just make me want to tear my hair out, and I just feel so overwhelmed. I was able to handle all of this better, but this semester has classes that are focused more on team projects and lots of presenting... in front of people. Honestly, this is a nightmare scenario.

The campus is always SO busy, I do not have a place to myself. I study in a very specific way (sort of one-person Feynman technique), and I haven't been able to do that because I need to pace around, talk to myself, different voices, different languages. My grades have taken a big drop, and I'm figuring out a new way to study that works as well as the one before did. I know that in this world, no one cares, but I need to survive somehow.

Do any of you have any tips?",1,1742223104.0,autism,1,1.0,False

My biggest concern is having a green couch, I feel like I would prefer white or leather but I found it’s hard to match the white couch to the coffee table vibe I like (marble/stone-esq) and quality leather sofas are wayyyy out of my budget.

Living room I'd like to cozy up, with a sectional, and much smaller coffee table with some side tables. I don't mind the art but the room desperately needs more color than the plants. Not sure how I feel about the fireplace under the TV, it's okay, fireplaces are cozy,  but just doesn't fit the space for me. 

Any ideas on dealing with the weird one step sunken living room or input on the dining room would be great! Bonus molly included. 

How big of a sectional should I get? Should it wrap around and separate the living room? I also think just a short cube style divider to put knick knacks on could be okay. ",3,1742222880.0,malelivingspace,0,1.0,False

It's been really handy to have. Part potting bench, part ""it's nice outside so I'll just work here instead of in the garage"", part place to set parts or coffee as I work on the car. Sitting outside all the time though, it's starting to rot and fall apart.

So, I figured, you know, this is no great piece of furniture but it does the job perfectly and it's sort of nice that it's crappy so I don't worry about anything that happens to it. I'll just replace it with pretty much what it is. Bought some pressure treated 2x4s and cut them to basically the same size I already had and then went to re-assemble and. . . the pressure treated 2x4s don't fit in the brackets.

This lumber is obviously quite wet, but is it likely to shrink enough as it dries to fit in those or are they only good for regular kiln-dried studs? Should I trim the ends to fit or will it eventually then be too loose?

If I'd realized this would be an issue, I'd have just taken the time and effort to make something a little nicer but I have enough to do I thought this would be a quick, stupid easy thing to get out of the way as spring winds up.

After 1 month he stopped replying to my texts and emails and said I didn't have any authorization to continue with the brand or to refund any orders (I refunded an order after him not answering me for weeks because I didn't know if he was actually roasting the coffee) he threatened to take legal actions and blabla bla. I was astonished but then he blocked all my accesses to our webpages and instagram. This guy has a name in the coffee industry in France and has a coffee shop in a small town. I told him he can keep the brand but just pay me what he owns me (300 Eur of salary plus my 20% of the brand) but hes just ignoring me. What should I do? Legal counsel would be worth it for 500 Eur? Maybe I can ask for more since ha has a business? I have a signed contract that he broke but not sure what to do now. I told him I was going to denounce him to our clients and to the coffee industry and this is what I'm doing more or less.
I think I would need a French lawyer to proceed further but not sure if it's worth all the expenses?

My body feels heavy as I rush through the crowd of students. I slept so late last night because of that damn Pharmacology subject—if it weren’t for the long quiz, I wouldn’t have stayed up. I couldn’t study in the morning either because I had hospital duty, and it was absolute hell. There were so many patients, and I didn’t even get a chance to rest.  

Right now, all my mind can think about is getting a cup of coffee. For sure, that’ll keep me awake. As I walk toward the school café, my eyelids grow heavier. I adjust my grip on my books because they feel like they’re getting heavier with every passing second.  

I sigh in relief when I finally reach the café. But before I can even get to the counter, my body starts swaying, and my knees feel weak. I know that if I take another step, I’ll collapse—damn, I still have a long quiz!  

And just as I feared, fatigue completely takes over my body. My vision blurs, everything starts spinning, and I try to find something to hold onto, but I’m too late.  

My body falls, and everything goes black.  

---  

Floating. I feel like I’m floating, my feet unable to touch the ground. I immediately open my eyes, only to find myself being held by a pair of steady arms.  

""You fainted. Probably exhaustion. Have you eaten already?""  

My brows furrow as I ask him to put me down. He follows my request, and I quickly step away to stand properly. I still feel a little dizzy, so he supports me.  

""Who—""  

""Ethan. Your things are back at the café, I left them at the counter. I was about to bring you to the clinic. And by the way, you’re clearly bad at managing your resources.""  

I raise an eyebrow at him.  

""Excuse me?"" He adjusts his glasses before responding.  

""Time. Energy. Health. You’re in a deficit,"" he says, as if diagnosing an unbalanced ledger. ""You need better planning.""  

I scowl at him. I just met this guy, and he already has so much to say about me! ""And what are you, a human calculator?""  

Ethan shrugs. ""An accountancy student. Close enough.""  

If I weren’t feeling dizzy, I probably would’ve punched him already. I let out a sarcastic laugh. ""Great. Just what I need—a walking spreadsheet trying to tell me how to live.""  

Ethan smirks. ""Well, someone has to.""  

I take a deep breath to calm myself and start walking away without saying another word. I still have to get my stuff—ugh!  

""Wow, are all nursing students this ungrateful?""  

My fist clenches, and I turn to face him with the most sarcastic smile I can muster.  

""Thank you,"" I say before finally leaving.  

I really hope this is the last time I ever see that guy. How annoying!

It took me three years to build an email list of 2000 organically with a social capital of 10000 across platforms.

I launched [my personal newsletter](https://vikra.cafe/) 20 months later. It took me six months to reach the first 500 subscribers.

Five months ago, [Aravind](https://x.com/aravindballa) and I launched [Caffeineletter](https://letter.coffee/) \- a newsletter for Indians who love coffee and wish to brew café-like coffee at home.

We acquired 100 subscribers in the last 30 days.

**What changed from the first newsletter to today?**

Iterations.

When I started Cognition, newsletters were not as popular as they are today. I didn't know how they're different from social media, blogs, or any other form.

But when we started Caffeineletter, we had:

* Systems to validate idea
* Knowing what metrics to focus
* Way better understanding of what works

I tried out about 20 marketing methods to grow Cognition. With Caffeineletter, it's three: social media, cold dms, [ads](https://readcognition.com/p/are-ads-bad).

As a marketer, I now understand where not to focus the energy and money. This is a result of building and studying newsletters day in and day out - mine, clients', and every email I read.

I saw a post a few days ago on this sub about how dating in your mid - late 20s is more like a job interview, and that seems to be pretty accurate from what I've heard both online and irl. At this age, dating is less ""I would love to get coffee with you sometime!"" and more ""how much do you contribute to your 401k? do you rent or do you own property? what kind of car do you drive?""

I'm not going to use this post as an opportunity to dunk on women for being materialistic or gold diggers, because I completely understand why dating is this way at this age. Women have a much shorter biological clock, and they're are often seen as undesirable past the age of 30, so your mid - late 20s is sort of a woman's last chance to ""lock down"" a good man with earning potential. I get why you'd be so concerned with a man's financial situation at this age.

I have no idea why people say they love this backpacking region so much— I’m having the most difficult time making friends (which is usually really easy for me) in my hostel and I’m seeing the same faces over and over again because we’re all on the same route, so I can’t “start over” but I don’t even know what starting over would look like? 

I’ve kind of lost all motivation and just wander aimlessly into coffee shops because I don’t know what to do here?? it’s so touristy, I don’t have the clothes all the other girls do, a lot of the guys treat me like SHIT either because they want to hook up or because they think I’m ugly i guess? ive like gone out w some people here and there spent a few days w them, but i always felt kind of… odd one out? like they were judging me ? 

again this is NOT something i usually struggle with at ALL i have lots of friends i make friends on my travels all the time i don’t know what’s going on here but it’s been three weeks now and im starting to lose it. 

I have traveled most of Europe, India, Brazil, Morocco, Tunisia, Malaysia, Singapore… in some pretty fucking wild ways— hitchhiking camping remote farms forced unexpected immersion into foreign languages formed incredible bonds with people had truly life changing amazing experiences— 

…I feel like I’m the awkward 12 year old girl in middle school again. 

Any advice on turning this around would be appreciated! Say, I stay in Laos for a few more days before finding a new work exchange somewhere else— how do I fix this? do i literally just need to buy new clothes and change my personality to be more sorority girlie ? i am so so lost and sad about this!!!

also just… the backpacker dudes in general are often so so so creepy here and i keep getting into shitty situations— guys telling me they’ve been “watching” me for weeks, touching me without consent, won’t even entertain small talk with me despite visibly coming onto me, i… hate it. so much. its really weird! 

no idea why people love this so much. it feels a bit dystopian— partying in developing countries and such. also the social media draw is gross. and yeah :( 

Thank you in advance!!! 

** talking about the other backpackers, not the locals/culture of these countries— backpackers don’t really get any exposure to that because it is all EXTREMELY commercialized here ",0,1742221718.0,solofemaletravellers,3,0.33,False

(My crush, never responded to my message inviting her for a coffee. Still contemplating, still waiting for a response)***

# Dearest CN,

Merriest Christmas again to you and to your family!

I am so happy that you accepted for us to catch-up, and I appreciate your time also despite the very busy schedule during this holiday season. And I hope you read this letter first before you open up my not-so-small gift sa'yo HAHA. I just want to let you know that you'll love these gifts (sana) for you.

I am so blessed that after 4 years we had catch-up and possibly made laughs together as we go on over coffee. Sana mapatawad mo pa'ko kung naging pabigat ako dati sa groupworks dati, pero di bali it was my oldself pero hey I am so blessed since we're in the same faith and our oldselves are dead and we are renewed and transformed *(we are both born-again)*.

And most likely you've shared about your school and all of the struggles your facing, and I hope ""the book"" which I gave you as my gift will help you in your way as you dream and be the lady that you are! I hope you also like the plushie, I just bought it because I know you like these things hahaha.

Before I close this letter, I just want to say something that I could've said 4 years ago before the pandemic hit and separated us...

I really, really like you a lot.

You are my ideal girl and partner right until now. The quality I find for a woman is with you. I didn't have the guts to tell you on chat kasi for sure baka mablock mo'ko dejk. Pero yun I just wanna let it out with-in this letter my feelings for you. I may have intentions if ever you'll respond positively over this letter.

It's fine if iba na mafeel mo after reading that one, and I understand you. It may affect our friendship also but it's good I just want to let out what is in my heart for you, CN.

Anyway, I hope that you'll have a good new year ahead and also do good parati.

Right now, we have a piece of paper with ""stock levels"" taped to the front of the fridge, and a laminated ""arrow"" with a magnet on the back of it that we slide up and down. 

I'd like to see if I can 3d print a wide flat piece with multiple slots and markings (ie. ""half and half,"" ""fizzy water"" with a number, say 1-5 to indicate how fixed we are for a particular item) and then slot-in some manual indicators (ie. like a knob with an arrow) into the slots that you can manually slide back and forth. I'd glue some magnets to the back, pop it on the fridge door, and as they say ""Bob's Your Uncle.""  

I'm betting something like this exists, but I have no idea what to call it or how to search for it. Some tries (""indicator board,"" ""sliding scale,"" etc) have turned up nothing.  Anybody seen some models around that can be printed like this?

**It's ok to feel overwhelmed...**



The start of 2025 has been a little rocky to say the least, with recent political changes, economic war and tariffs escalation leading to more inflation, stock market correction and possibly job uncertainty... 

For some it's been even harder with recent changes in their life (breakup, loss of closed ones, feeling paralyzed at a crossroad with important life decisions to make...)

  
For others, we just have the anxiety/depression genes running in our family and it's a constant struggle to try to stay afloat. Or could it be that we are just a little bit more sensitive than others?

Why is life so hard and unfair? How come everyone is not seeing all the issues I am seeing with the world today? Why does it feel like the whole society is designed so that we feel so powerless?



When you are experiencing the lows of life's roller coaster, remember these 3 pillars of mental health:



\- Sleeping well

\- Eating well

\- Exercising



**Action is the solution when you feel paralyzed by anxiety or depression.** 

The earlier you shift your mind state from ""receiving and feeling the weight of the world on my shoulder"" to ""I'm not going to give up and I'm going to do something for myself"", the better. 

The more you wait and go down the rabbit whole of passivity and depression, the harder it will be to get out of it. SO learn to recognize the early signals and get into HUNTER MODE. 

TAKE ACTION!



  
**Improve Sleep Quality**



There's nothing more frustrating than rolling around in your bed, overthinking life changing decisions and possibilities in your head, letting the little monkey loose to cycle around on his unicycle until 2 am...



https://i.redd.it/j4260hab89pe1.gif

Here's a few tricks:



\- Write your thoughts and your goals for the next day, then forget about them for the night. They're now out of your head, they're on paper in your journal, so you'll know what to start the day with. 



\- Stop using the computer or your phone at least 1h before bed time, instead read a book, stretch, write in your journal or listen to calm music.



https://i.redd.it/fvdi0fhc89pe1.gif

\- Avoid working on your laptop in your bed. Your bedroom, especially your bed should be for sleeping and intimacy only.



\- No coffee after 1pm, no alcohol **four hours** before you plan on going to sleep. Even though alcohol can make you feel sleepy, it may impact your overall quality of sleep.



\- Limit your use of social media. The billionaires of this world are competing for your attention, trying to make you feel envious of others stories or argue with trolls while wasting your precious time. But you are smarter than that.



\- When it's time to go to bed, thank the universe for what you are grateful for. Things might not all be perfect at the moment, however you surely have many things to be grateful for:

  
Are you physically healthy? We probably all know someone who's sadly been diagnosed with a terminal illness.  



Do you have a job? It might not be the best job, but you're probably not in the street otherwise you wouldn't be reading this right now.



Do you have use of both your arms and legs? At least 57.7 million people worldwide were living with limb loss due to traumatic causes in 2017.



Have you accomplished anything in life that you're proud of? Surely you did!



Thank the universe for it. Once you've done that, you can ask the universe to help you with whatever challenging situation you need help with. 

  
***""Happiness doesn't depend on what we have, but it does depend on how we feel about what we have. We can be happy with little and miserable with much."" - Buddha***



Finally, use this life changing breathing technique:  When you go to bed, put both of your hands on your diaphragm (one hand below and one hand above your belly button). Focus bringing your breathing from there instead of your chest. Slow down your breathing. Focus your attention on your breathing, nothing else. Feel your belly going up and down, Do this for 10 minutes. You should probably fall asleep before your reach the 10 minutes...zzzz

**Why do we sleep so well after surfing?**



Surfing doesn’t just benefit your body and mind during the day – it can also improve your sleep quality at night.



You’ll get a burst of dopamine, aka the “feel-good” hormone, when you’ll catch and drop into a nice wave.



You’ll also feel more relaxed after spending time in the water. This is called the [**Blue Mind Theory**](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsurfexpedition.com%2Fsurfing-and-the-blue-mind-theory%2F&data=05%7C02%7C%7Cb39c0e5b2ace4165d84108dd640c1cf2%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638776725369517453%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=WarI0caZDOsXUXqvZj5MCOw7mEu4qxptKteTSIPJp9w%3D&reserved=0)**.** According to Wallace J. Nichols, *blue mind* is the antidote to the *red mind*, which is the state of being defined by anxiousness or over-stimulation.



Research has proven that spending time near a body of water has a number of surprising mental and physiological health benefits: it can lower stress in the body, but it can also increase your feeling of overall well being (the ability to be comfortable, healthy or happy).



By reducing stress, anxiety, and insomnia, and promoting better sleep patterns, surfing can help you achieve a restful night’s sleep, which is essential for overall health and well-being.

**Improve Eating habits**



Sure it's easy to order pizza to get yourself in a better mood. And of course what's best with pizza.. beer! But that won't get you feeling better in the long run. 



If you're feeling low, cutting down all alcohol should be your #1 goal.



Some people use alcohol to cope with depression or anxiety, but this can worsen the problem and lead to dependence. 



A good tip for cutting down alcohol is removing all beers and wine bottles from the fridge, so that when you have the urge to grab a cold one, there are none to be found. Replace this with your favourite non-alcoholic drink, avoiding soda if possible. A personal favourite is coconut water, which we have plenty of around the retreat.



So get yourself together, cut fat, sugar and processed food from your diet and focus instead on fresh vegetable, fish, and beans- they are a nutritional powerhouse, rich in protein and fiber, and include varieties like chickpeas, black beans, and kidney beans. 



You can use your stay at our retreat as a springboard to starting eating more healthy food, inspired by chef Dian [who cooks hearty and nutritious meals with love](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FAttraction_Review-g1567337-d14895857-Reviews-Surf_Expedition-Pavones_Province_of_Puntarenas.html&data=05%7C02%7C%7Cb39c0e5b2ace4165d84108dd640c1cf2%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638776725369534038%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=nSN6olDVnRGbZb11E5Z2YwxXAL48Sy%2F%2FOZXjVunfBLA%3D&reserved=0) for all of our guests.

**Get moving everyday!**



If you've managed to have at least 8h of sleep and skipped the evening beer/drink for a day or two, you should now be feeling already a bit more energized.



Use this momentum to start a new exercising routine!

2. Set a minimum of 30-45 minutes without distraction, preferably first thing in the morning to make sure you put yourself first before doing anything else.



3. Write down 5-6 exercises you want to do, the weight, reps and serie in a notebook to track your progress every day and keep you on track.



No need to sign up for a gym membership. You can get a skipping rope ($10), a yoga mat ($15), a training ball ($20) and some light free weights (8-10lbs) to start ($15). You can also read this article for [exercises that will help you surfing.](https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsurfexpedition.com%2Fget-fit-for-surfing-11-exercises-that-make-learning-to-surf-easier%2F&data=05%7C02%7C%7Cb39c0e5b2ace4165d84108dd640c1cf2%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638776725369550963%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=5eJn8QG8%2BSKAr4CSFxBIz%2F985wJSIfRfwW9x0HqiuLk%3D&reserved=0)



Will it be hard at first, yes! Will it be worth it? Absolutely! And the good news is that once you start exercising daily, you will also sleep better, and you'll be motivated to eat better. So it will reverse the negative spin cycle.

As far as I can work out, the break up was caused primarily due to her lack of communication about her feelings and how to deal with them and her not necessarily handling the many issues that she had in the healthiest of ways.

Anyhow, it resulted in rather a messy breakup. I was left ruined, she was left upset from my attempts to speak to her about things and whilst I don't think I've truly recovered the awful way she broke up with me, I've definitely learned a lot from the experience.

Scrolling forward to a couple of days ago, I was out with mutual friends and after an hour or so of each of us *actively* avoiding one another, we slowly began to exchange small talk about the stuff we were doing and looking at.

Half an hour or so later, I managed to speak to her on her own and asked her if we could talk about what happened, not there on the day but some point in the near future, and that at the very least I wanted to at least fix the present awkwardness between us. She immediately looked anxious and upset with me and said that she didn't want to revisit what happened between us there and then, however she mentioned that she genuinely at some point wanted to talk about it with me.

Our friends left us alone at this point.

We got talking about how our lives had went between when we last spoke as a couple and now, and it was during this I felt something had flipped between us.

Within five minutes of me properly talking to her, her demeanour had changed completely. Gone was the anxious person, the one who left me on unread, the one had been doing everything to avoid me, to being one that was belly laughing at the silliest of my anecdotes and jokes, someone that acted like she trusted me once again. It looked like she was engaging and excited to be speaking to me and discussing each other's lives but I'm sure deep down she was still really upset with what happened years ago, as I definitely was.

It almost felt like the person that I knew before we got into a relationship with all those years ago was back in the room with me, alone.

The group of us went for coffee afterwards and me and my ex may have joked around a bit about what happened during the breakup, but we spent time just getting used to speaking to one another again. As she was leaving to go home, she turned her entire body at me and stared at me for what seemed like an eternity, as if she was looking into my soul (or thinking for something to say)

**I'm confused about everything, really.** I was expecting her to have told me to go away, to not speak to her, or for her to be indifferent but for her to be *that welcoming and happy* to be speaking to me, despite how painful it was for both of us?

I didn't ask her for a date for that catch up, as unsurprisingly, I am still, even today, attempting to process what happened this past weekend and I don't want to walk into a potentially scary conversation without having all my wits about me.

I can't seem to put my finger on what exactly happened, and I'm hoping you guys can help me figure out why she behaved like this, and what she might be thinking.",1,1742221346.0,relationship_advice,2,0.67,False

1jddpp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/severence/comments/1jddpp9/current_theory_re_devon_and_mark/,Current theory re Devon and Mark,"We still don’t know much about their childhood.  
My personal total guess theory is this:
- Their father was somehow connected to Lumon and that was related to his “alcoholism.” Either the stress led him to drink, or maybe he was another ether addict (but hiding it as alcohol)
- Mark was picked as a child for Lumon. He’s clearly extremely important to them. We don’t yet know what they might have done to him as a child (maybe nothing, maybe psychological manipulation he isn’t yet aware of), but the Lexington letter suggests that people can be pretty easily manipulated to “choose” jobs at Lumon. 
- Devon is very smart. She’s not Lumon-connected, but she’s very highly suspicious of the company. She’s basically our investigative reporter trying to figure out what’s happening to her brother. She knows he’s putting himself at risk by getting closer to the company, but she wants to see where it leads. She’s terrified for him, but wants to find out. 
- Rickon is an Egan family member. And / or he’s severed. She married him to do more research into Lumon. The Rickon we know doesn’t seem to know that he’s an Egan or severed. Rickon keeps writing books because his Lumon memories are leaking - similar to Irving painting the same thing over and over. 
- Rickon “picked” the birthing retreat, but this could have easily been manipulated by Devon. Maybe she left pamphlets around the house or mentioned that she heard about it and it sounded nice, etc. she wanted to investigate. 
- Her “coffee mission” was so obviously to investigate. 
- Rickon and Devon don’t know the exact details of severance - Rickon called Mark several times while Devon was in labor. He genuinely didn’t know whether Mark could have his phone “down there.” Rickon also asked if Mark could leave work early. 
- Devon _definitely_ would have noticed that there is exactly one other neighbor in Marks entire neighborhood - Selvig. Not hard to figure out Selvig is a Lumon plant. Devon hired her to investigate her. 
-Gemma was a Lumon plant. Devon probably suspects this, but again she doesn’t know the details yet. It was too perfect for Mark to randomly meet his beautiful, intellectual match at a Lumon blood drive. Unclear whether “real world” Gemma is real or a Lumon robot. 
- Devon legit doesn’t know whether Selvig/Cobel is dangerous. She called her to help Mark because she frankly doesn’t know who else to call and now her fear for Mark is overriding her desire to keep her investigation under wraps. But she’s 100% certain that Cobel knows _something_ and Devon needs that intel _now_ to help her brother. The waiting time is over. 

Bonus speculation!
- There is going to be a literal Egan army. He’s been sending pregnant women to the birthing center for decades. 
- The “uprising” is going to be real - it’s gonna be an actual war. 
- Egan Rickon is going to be woken up and possibly kill Devon. Their baby has Egan DNA - his DNA. He’s going to want that baby. 
- I like the theory that Helena, Drummond, and Rickon are siblings. They’re 3 of the 4 tempers. We haven’t met the fourth yet.

About St.Petersburg, Got to say, this place is freezing, after some months in the summer nights f Rio, and it's 30 degrees, going to a winter of -1 was a fucking change, but a welcomed one, i don't know how mortals were surviving with that hell on earth during the daytime of Carnaval.  
  
Well, i'm currently outside a nice hotel at downtown, smoking a cigarrette and enjoying a cup of something that tastes similar to coffee, thanks to our thin blood amigos from Rio, the lads made a hell of a work with alchemy, it does have a taste of iron , but it's almost like drink cafea again, and god it's good.  
  
I'm waiting a guy named Truls, he got a special gift for me, i hope i don't need to use it , but it nice as hell.  
Thanks once again to my benefactor, it's been years since i have seen such luxurius place. But relax, i won't stay long, soon i will leave to meet the places i need to visit. Work nevers stops.  
  
*Well, my question to all you my friends is, any tips about Russian territory?*   
with all the stuff going around the mortals this place is already a bit dangerous, but what about our kind? about the others that stalk the night?   
I Know this place used to have some heavy hitters, so if you know something, i would be glad to know.  


And for my other clients, this will be a quick job, even if a bit dangerous, give me a week or two and i will be right by your side doing what needs to be done.

One of them I’m good friends with, the other I’d wanna get to know more iykwim…

He’s so cute 🥰😍 He’s got glasses like me, his hair is goddamn gorgeous, and he’s so sweet. He can rock any outfit he wears. He’s funny and was really caring and helping with our project construction today. 

Here’s the problem: I put quotes between straight because I don’t know his sexuality. I’m 90% sure he’s straight but I’m so scared to ask. I’m thinking about talking to him or asking him to get coffee or something to find that out, but I just don’t know how to handle this. Any advice is needed!

I had a baby almost 6 months ago. I love being a stay at home mom. I worked full time before I had her, and me and SO split the bills. We were always extremely loving and affectionate and great communication.  We would text or check in, middle of the day etc, send eachother funny things. 

He makes good enough money for me to be a SAHM. And we both agreed we wanted this for our daughter.  I understand there are changes when a child comes but it's like our relationship did a 180. I still texted and checked in but now I'd get one word answers. He tells me he's too busy at work now but I see him online on fb all the time which is fine but it's like he has no more interest in connecting throughout the day. He said ""I didn't think you needed constant reassurance"". I told him I don't need to constantly talk, but I liked our little texts or memes to let eachother know we are thinking of eachother. 

I wish I never said anyting bc it made it worse and now he feels forced to talk to me. Affection also went completely out the window and I feel  invisible in my own house. 

I didn't realize how much I loved the interactions at work, now that I have zero adult interactions. I have joined some groups though and met with a friend or two for coffee and immediately felt better. So I need to keep doing things like that. 

I just have never felt so lonely. Do the relationship changes go back to normal? We feel so distant now and I hate it. I do love being home with my daughter though and I'm getting into a good cleaning/shopping/meal prep routine, so that's the positives",2,1742220919.0,stayathomemoms,2,1.0,False
