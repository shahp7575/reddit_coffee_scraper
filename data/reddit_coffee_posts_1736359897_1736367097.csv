Yesterday, while I was talking to her, her replies were delayed by 30 seconds to a minute. I assumed she was using her phone for something else during our conversation. For context, I work and go to school, so I don’t have much free time. When I do, I really want to spend it talking to her.

Yesterday, I was working alone at a coffee shop, and there were no customers throughout the day. I was messaging her, trying to have a conversation, but her replies were short and delayed—things like “yes,” “no,” or “okay”—which made me feel like she wasn’t interested in talking. I had a strong feeling she was using YouTube or Facebook during this time.

That evening, after logging out from work, I called her. I asked her to be honest with me and admitted that I felt like she was using YouTube or Facebook while we were talking. She admitted that she was. I got upset because, in the past, when we first started talking, I used to do the same thing, but when she told me it bothered her, I stopped and gave her my full attention during our conversations. It hurt to see her doing something she had previously asked me not to do.

I told her I wanted to have an honest conversation, and she agreed. We talked through a video call, and I asked if she was starting to lose interest in me. She admitted that she was. My world shattered upon hearing that. I asked her if she still loved me, and she said yes.

I told her I was disappointed and hurt by her answer. I explained that when someone starts losing interest in their partner, love often fades next. I even reminded her of her past relationship, asking her to think about what she felt before breaking up with her ex. I pointed out that she probably felt a loss of interest first, which eventually led to the end of that relationship.

I started to sound like I was about to break up with her, and she began crying, saying she didn’t want to break up. I reassured her that I wasn’t breaking up with her. Now it’s 3:52 AM, and I’m wondering if I did the right thing by giving her another chance.

I’m pretty sure she’s losing interest in me, especially because whenever I suggest new things for us to do together, she always says no. Ironically, she mentioned that one of the reasons for her loss of interest is that we’re doing the same things every day. I never called her out on this contradiction, but it’s frustrating because I’m trying to make changes while she refuses to try new things.

Hello there!

I've been captivated by the concept of transactional relationships, particularly the escort-client dynamic, for years. This prompt explores something a little quieter and more intimate—a story where the relationship is less about explosive drama and more about gentle growth, human connection, and lingering grief.

This is a slice-of-life exploration of two flawed, resilient people carving out a space for themselves in a forgotten corner of the world. It’s slow-burn, atmospheric, and infused with tenderness. It’s a story about love—not necessarily romantic—between two unlikely souls.

# PREVIEW

*Here’s a peek into the atmosphere of the story—just a vignette to set the tone:*

The coffee shop was quiet at this hour. You sat across from him, legs tucked beneath you in a chair too small for your curves, sipping something sugary and warm. His book sat open on the table, but his attention lingered on the chipped nail polish on your fingers as you traced lazy circles on the rim of your cup.

“I don’t think I’ve ever seen you smile,” you teased softly, your voice low and teasing but not unkind.

His lips twitched, almost like he was going to. Almost. Instead, he closed his book and leaned back in his chair, stretching his legs. The denim strained slightly around his knees, and he winced.

“Old men don’t have much to smile about,” he said, his voice rough and warm like an old record.

You laughed—something bright and unguarded. “Old man, huh? You’re not that bad.”

He raised an eyebrow. “Just trying to keep up with you, sweetheart.”

And there it was again: that glint of affection that always took you by surprise. For a man who carried so much sadness, he made you feel seen.

# THE PITCH

This story unfolds in a small, coastal town that time forgot. The kind of place where the buildings are faded, the winters are long, and everyone knows everyone else's business. Your character is a sex worker, and mine is her steady, reliable client. They’ve been meeting regularly for months—quiet evenings in her apartment or mornings spent walking along the beach.

He’s a former CEO, once towering in wealth and influence, now humbled by loss. His wife and children died in a car accident two years ago, leaving him untethered. His grief brought him here, to this quiet town, where he spends his days walking the streets, drinking coffee, and keeping to himself.

She’s a woman in her 30s—warm, sharp, and practical. She has curves that don’t fit into conventional standards of beauty but fit perfectly into this narrative: soft, voluptuous, and deeply human. She doesn’t find him attractive in the traditional sense, but there’s something about the steadiness of his presence that draws her in. He treats her kindly, listens when she speaks, and never asks for anything she doesn’t want to give.

# WHAT I’M LOOKING FOR

1. **Wholesome, Slow-Burn Intimacy** This is about the gradual deepening of their connection—intimacy found in unremarkable moments. The sex is secondary to the bond they’re building.
2. **Complex, Flawed Characters** They’re both carrying weight: his grief, her struggles. I want to explore their backstories and watch as they slowly peel back their layers for each other.
3. **Atmospheric Setting** The town is almost a character itself. Let’s make it vivid—whether it’s the smell of salt in the air, the warmth of a diner on a cold day, or the creak of old wood beneath their feet.
4. **Realism** This includes body types and personalities. My character is in his late 50s/early 60s, paunchy but solid, with a quiet strength. Yours is curvy, with a body that’s seen life and a spirit that hasn’t been dimmed by hardship.
5. **Unanswered Questions** Does she ever ask about his past? What’s hers? Does their arrangement evolve into something deeper, or do they remain two souls finding fleeting comfort in each other?

# ABOUT ME

I’m a 20-something male writer who loves dense, emotionally driven narratives and realistic characters. I enjoy exploring power dynamics, unpacking emotionally complex relationships, and celebrating imperfect, real bodies. I enjoy partners who can match my enthusiasm for worldbuilding and character development.

I’m looking for someone who can embody a nuanced, vibrant female lead and isn’t afraid to delve into the messiness of life. Let’s explore these characters, this town, and their stories together.

I am the main income winner and don't want to live without seeing my kids every day. But idk if we can stay together because I just don't feel the same about her since then.

1hwti6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepsMcPasta/comments/1hwti6a/i_woke_up_to_my_wife_staring_at_me_she_says_shes/,I Woke Up to My Wife Staring at Me. She Says She’s Waiting for the ‘Real Me.’,"My wife, Laura, has always been my rock. She’s the grounded one, the person who keeps me sane when life gets messy. We’ve been married for six years, and our life together has been, for the most part, normal. Maybe even boring in the best way. Steady jobs, a little house in the suburbs, and the kind of routine you don’t even think about because it just works.

That’s why all of this is so hard to wrap my head around. It’s like I’m losing her, or maybe I’m losing something about her, if that makes any sense. It started small. Little things I barely noticed at first.

Like, a couple of weeks ago, we were sitting on the couch watching TV, and I realized she wasn’t laughing at a joke I knew she’d normally find funny. When I looked over, she was staring at the screen, but her eyes weren’t focused. She was somewhere else. I nudged her, and she blinked like I’d snapped her out of a trance. She laughed it off, said she was just tired.

Another time, she forgot where she put her keys. Now, I know that sounds like nothing, who doesn’t lose their keys? But Laura never does. She’s meticulous. The kind of person who has “a place for everything and everything in its place.” She even joked about how out of character it was. “Guess I’m getting old,” she said, with this weird little laugh that didn’t feel like her.

There have been other moments, too. Like how she zones out during conversations, or how she’s started hesitating when she speaks, like she’s trying to figure out what to say. At first, I thought she might just be stressed. Work’s been rough on both of us lately, and everyone has off days. But it’s happening more and more, and I can’t shake the feeling that something’s off.

I keep telling myself it’s probably nothing. Couples go through phases, right? People change a little over time. But the thing is, this doesn’t feel like a little change. It feels like she’s slipping away, like she’s here but... not here. And I don’t know what to do with that.

At first, I thought I was just being paranoid. Now I’m not so sure. And the worst part? It’s not just the little things anymore. It’s bigger now. Weirder.

And it’s starting to scare me.

\-

It happened a few nights ago, and I can’t stop thinking about it. I haven’t been able to sleep properly since.

I woke up around 2 a.m., I think. You know that half-awake state where you’re not totally sure what’s real yet? At first, I couldn’t figure out why I woke up, there wasn’t any noise or anything, but then I saw her. Laura. She was sitting on the edge of the bed, completely still, facing me.

It took a second for my brain to catch up, but when it did, I realized something was wrong. Her face was... blank. Totally expressionless. Her eyes were wide open, and she wasn’t blinking. Just staring at me, like she was waiting for something.

“Laura?” I mumbled, still half-asleep. “What are you doing?”

She didn’t answer right away. Then, in this flat, monotone voice, one I’ve never heard from her before, she said, “I’m waiting for the real you.”

I honestly didn’t know how to respond. My first thought was that she was sleepwalking. She’s never done it before, but hey, there’s a first time for everything, right? So, I tried to play it off. I even laughed a little, like, “Okay, creepy, what does that mean?”

She didn’t laugh. She didn’t even move. She just kept staring at me for a few seconds, like she was deciding something. Then she stood up, turned around, and walked out of the room without saying another word.

I sat there for a minute, trying to process what just happened. I wanted to follow her, but something in the way she looked at me, so cold, so... unfamiliar, made my skin crawl. Eventually, I convinced myself it was just a weird dream or some kind of sleepwalking thing.

In the morning, I brought it up over breakfast. I tried to keep it casual, like, “Hey, do you remember getting up last night?” She just stared at me for a second, like she was trying to figure out what I was talking about. Then she smiled, this small, tight smile, and said, “Nope, must’ve been dreaming.”

That was it. No follow-up, no questions. She just went back to eating like nothing happened.

I don’t know. Maybe she really doesn’t remember, but something about the way she brushed it off felt... off. Forced, maybe? Like she was trying too hard to act normal.

I’ve been trying to convince myself it wasn’t a big deal. That it was just a one-time, weird thing. But the way she looked at me that night, the way she said that, keeps replaying in my head.

“I’m waiting for the real you.”

What the hell is that supposed to mean?

\-

A couple of nights before everything really fell apart, I caught Laura doing something... strange.

I woke up around midnight to use the bathroom and noticed her side of the bed was empty. I didn’t think much of it at first—maybe she couldn’t sleep and went downstairs. But as I passed the guest room, I saw the door was cracked open, and the light was on.

I peeked inside, and there she was. She was sitting cross-legged on the floor, her back to me, with her phone flashlight pointed at a small notebook in her lap. Her hair was messy, like she’d been tugging at it, and she was whispering to herself.

“Laura?” I said softly, trying not to startle her.

She froze for a second, then turned to look at me. Her face was completely blank, like she wasn’t even surprised to see me.

“What are you doing?” I asked.

She didn’t answer. She just snapped the notebook shut and got up, walking past me without saying a word. She didn’t even bother turning off the light.

I stood there for a while, trying to figure out what I’d just seen. Eventually, I picked up the notebook she’d left on the floor. It was old—one of those cheap, spiral-bound ones you’d pick up for a few bucks. Most of the pages were blank, but the ones she’d written on were covered in what looked like... instructions.

Not coherent ones, though. Things like:

“Ask questions.”  
“Wait until he slips.”  
“Check the reflection again.”  
It didn’t make sense.

I put the notebook back where I’d found it and went back to bed, but I didn’t sleep. I couldn’t shake the feeling that whatever she was writing about, it wasn’t meant for me to see.

\-

Trying to let things pass didn't work. Things didn’t stop. If anything, it was getting worse.

A few days after she sat on the bed and said that creepy stuff about “waiting for the real me,” Laura started acting... different. Not in huge, obvious ways, but enough that I couldn't stop noticing it.

She’s been asking these weird questions. Stuff like, “Do you ever feel like you’re not yourself?” or, “What if this isn’t the life you’re supposed to have?” She doesn’t say it in a joking way, either. Her tone is serious, like she’s actually expecting me to give her some deep answer. And every time, I just stammer something like, “I don’t know, I guess?” because what else am I supposed to say?

She’s been staring at me, too. A lot. It’s not like she’s zoning out anymore, it’s deliberate. I’ll catch her watching me while I’m eating dinner, scrolling through my phone, or even brushing my teeth. I asked her about it once, tried to make it a joke, like, “What? Do I have something on my face?” She just shrugged and said, “I’m just trying to see something.”

See what?

The worst was a couple of nights ago. I woke up again in the middle of the night, and Laura wasn’t in bed. My first thought was the bathroom, but when I rolled over, I saw her. She was standing in the corner of the room, facing the wall.

I’m not proud of this, but I froze. Like, every hair on my body stood up at once, and my mouth went dry. It was the way she was standing, completely still, her shoulders just slightly hunched, like she was listening for something.

“Laura?” I finally managed to croak out.

She didn’t move for a few seconds, but then she whispered, “Not yet. You’re not ready.”

I can’t even explain how that felt. My stomach dropped, and my heart started pounding so hard I thought it was going to burst.

I didn’t know what to say. I just stared at her, trying to make sense of what was happening. Eventually, she turned around, walked back to bed, and climbed in like nothing happened. She didn’t even look at me.

I didn’t sleep the rest of the night.

The next day, I tried to bring it up, casually at first, just testing the waters. But the moment I mentioned her getting up at night, she snapped. She told me I was the one acting strange, always questioning her, always looking at her like she’s the problem.

That’s when I started wondering if maybe it is me. Am I making this up? Am I just stressed out and reading too much into everything?

But then I checked her phone.

I know, I know. That was scummy of me. But I couldn’t stop myself. And what I found... I can’t unsee it. Her search history was filled with things like, “How to identify a doppelgänger,” “Signs of possession,” and “When someone isn’t who they say they are.”

I don’t even know how to process that. She’s clearly convinced something’s wrong with me, but now I’m wondering if it’s actually the other way around. What if something’s wrong with her?

Or... God, I hate that I’m even thinking this, what if something’s wrong with both of us?

I don’t know. I just... I don’t know anymore. And it’s starting to feel like I’m not going to figure it out until it’s too late.

\-

I thought it couldn’t get worse. I thought maybe it would blow over, that Laura just needed time, or maybe I needed to stop overthinking everything. I was wrong. So, so wrong.

A few nights ago, I woke up again. This time, Laura wasn’t sitting at the edge of the bed or standing in the corner. She was right beside me, holding a small mirror up to my face.

At first, I didn’t even understand what I was looking at. The moonlight was catching the mirror at an angle, and it took my half-asleep brain a few seconds to realize what was happening. She was whispering something, over and over.

“Why won’t you show yourself? Why won’t you show yourself?”

I froze. I don’t know if you’ve ever felt true fear before, but it’s not like in the movies. It’s cold and paralyzing, and it makes you feel like you’re outside your own body.

“Laura,” I said, my voice cracking. “What are you doing?”

She didn’t look at me. She just kept holding the mirror, her eyes locked on my reflection. Her whisper turned into a low mutter, then into something more desperate.

I reached out and grabbed the mirror, yanking it away. “What the hell is going on?” I demanded.

And that’s when she snapped.

“You’re not him!” she screamed, her voice raw and trembling. “You’re not the man I married!”

It wasn’t just anger. It was something deeper- pure terror, like she was cornered by something she couldn’t understand.

I tried to calm her down, but she kept shaking her head, backing away from me. “He talks to me,” she said, her voice breaking. “Every night. In my dreams. He looks like you, but he’s not you. He’s trapped, and he’s begging me to help him. He says you’re the one keeping him there.”

I just stared at her, trying to process what she was saying. None of it made sense. “Laura,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady, “you’re just having nightmares. That’s all this is. Stress, lack of sleep, it’s messing with your head.”

But she wouldn’t listen. She pointed at me, her hands shaking, and said, “I can feel it. You’re not him. You’re not... right.”

I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know how to make her believe me.

She left the room after that, slamming the door behind her. I just sat there, staring at the mirror in my hands, trying to convince myself that this was all in her head. That there was nothing wrong with me.

But then doubt started creeping in. What if she was right? What if something really was wrong with me?

I spent the rest of the night searching for answers. I tore through the house, looking for anything that might explain why she was acting this way. Finally, in the attic, I found an old box of her things. Inside was a journal she kept from the early years of our relationship.

I know I shouldn’t have read it, but I was desperate.

The first few entries were normal, sweet, even. Little notes about our dates, funny moments we’d shared. But as I kept reading, things started to get... strange.

There were detailed descriptions of events I had no memory of. A trip to the beach where I apparently got sunburned so badly Laura had to cover me in aloe. A dinner party with friends where I supposedly made everyone laugh so hard they cried. I don’t remember any of it.

And then there was one entry that stopped me cold:

“Last night, I woke up and saw him standing at the foot of the bed. He looked like my husband, but something about him was wrong. When he realized I was awake, he smiled at me, but it wasn’t his smile. It felt... hollow. Like he was pretending to be human.”

I don’t know what’s happening. I don’t know what to believe anymore.

But the worst part? When I read that entry, it felt familiar. Like I’d lived it before. But how could I?

How could I forget something like that?

\-

I couldn’t keep it to myself anymore. I had to confront her. I thought if I just showed Laura the journal, we could finally talk this out, get everything out in the open and figure out what the hell was happening to us.

It didn’t go the way I hoped.

I found her in the kitchen the next morning, just sitting at the table, staring at her coffee like she didn’t even see it. I put the journal down in front of her and said, “You need to explain this.”

She looked up at me, then down at the journal, her face pale. For a second, I thought she might deny everything. But then she flipped through the pages like she knew exactly what she was looking for. She stopped at one specific entry and slid it toward me without saying a word.

I picked it up and started reading.

“Last night, I woke up and saw him standing at the foot of the bed. He looked like my husband, but something about him was wrong. When he realized I was awake, he smiled at me, but it wasn’t his smile. It felt... hollow. Like he was pretending to be human.”

“I don’t understand,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper.

“That’s when I knew,” Laura said, her voice trembling. “That’s the night I realized you weren’t... you.”

I tried to argue, to tell her this was crazy, but she cut me off. “You don’t remember, do you?” she said, tears streaming down her face. “Or maybe you do, and you just won’t admit it. But I know what I saw. That wasn’t you.”

I reached out to her, desperate to calm her down, to make her believe me, but she recoiled so fast she knocked over her chair.

“Don’t touch me!” she screamed, backing into the corner of the room. “I can’t... I can’t do this anymore. I don’t know what you are, but you’re not him.”

Her words hit me like a punch to the gut. I just stood there, frozen, watching as she broke down in front of me. I wanted to yell, to shake her, to make her understand that I’m still me. But am I?

After a few minutes, she ran upstairs and slammed the door. I didn’t follow her. I couldn’t.

Instead, I sat at the table, staring at the journal. The entry kept looping in my mind. “He looked like my husband, but something about him was wrong.”

I don’t know how long I sat there before I got up and went to the bathroom. I don’t even know why I did it. Maybe I just needed to see myself, to prove to myself that I hadn’t changed.

I stood in front of the mirror, looking at my reflection. At first, everything seemed normal. Same face, same tired eyes, same messy hair. But then I noticed it.

It was small, almost imperceptible. But it was there.

My smile.

It didn’t look... right. It felt too wide, like it didn’t quite belong to me.

I’m still standing here, staring at it, trying to convince myself it’s just in my head. That it’s just stress or exhaustion or something normal.

But the longer I look, the more certain I am.

She’s right.

It’s not my smile.",1,1736366744.0,CreepsMcPasta,0,1.0,False

I had a fasting insulin level of 17 two years back...I have started Tirzepatide ( compounded Mounjaro) few months back and have lost weight and currently weigh 154 and I am 5'7 but I would still like to lose a lot more..

I got my fasting insulin test done yesterday, and it has gone down to 5.. please note that I have been fasting the last few days where I was eating extremely low calories, so I don't know if that resulted in such low numbers and if it's a temporary effect. 

However, I am feeling really depressed... even with such low insulin numbers, my hidradenitis is still there? Please note that this condition is not hereditary and it started only at the age of 32 so it's been 4 years now. 

 One thing to note is that even though I am losing weight, I still eat unhealthy at times. I will have a mocha coffee,  or a chocolate chip muffin with my coffee or fried chicken or lots of bacon.

Does the underlying condition depend on insulin levels, and if so, my insulin levels are pretty normal now?

Or does the condition depend on how much carb and sugar you put into your body regardless of your insulin levels?

Sorry for this long post, and I would greatly appreciate it if I could get some help here. Thank you very much",1,1736366724.0,PCOS,1,1.0,False

1hwte78,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverendGuitars/comments/1hwte78/double_agent_roundhouse/,"Double Agent, Roundhouse","Hi all

I have recently discovered Reverend guitar brand after one caught my eye when researching into PRS SE guitars. I was looking for a sorta Les Paul shaped guitar but without the chunky neck (I’ve played mostly Teles and Strats). 

Unfortunately there’s no guitar shops near me that stock Reverend, but from looking at reviews it looks like they may be exactly what I’m looking for at a similar price point to the more higher end PRS SE stuff. 

I really like the look of the Roundhouse with railhammer pickups, and was decided on that (in coffee burst) but the Double Agent OG in that Periwinkle Burst looks fantastic also! My question is with regards to the pickups mostly. I have a Fender American Pro ii Strat, which is why I wanted a humbucker guitar to complement. Playing mostly rock/prog/indy/metal and ambient styles. But that P90 pickup with bass contour sounds like it cleans up beautifully! I’m just after others thoughts on these two models if that’s ok? Hopefully it’ll stop me sitting on the fence! I’m guessing it’s just choosing between the more versatile (double agent) or the more rockin (roundhouse ra)?

1hwtdxx,https://i.redd.it/hwu55ekzstbe1.jpeg,What do y’all think of my humble collection? (20M),"This stand is perfect for me because it’s forced me to limit myself to 9, which I would say is the perfect amount for an average guy like myself.

Top Row:

Halloween Man X - Cheap blind buy; very interesting and compelling frag. Starts very blue and heavy on lavender and transitions to a darker, ambery coffee which I really love. Can’t go wrong for the price.

Guerlain L’Homme Ideal EDT: Most recent blind buy. This one is a bit divisive to me. The notes really intrigued me, as I’d wanted to try an almond-heavy frag for a while, but I think this one needs some time to grow on me. It’s a very “dry” frag and I would say the most unique and complex in my rotation, however I’m not sure how I feel about it yet. It’s very well blended, but I need a few more wears to see where it fits in.

ADG Profondo Parfum: This smells amazing in the air and from the atomizer, but isn’t quite so good with my skin chemistry unfortunately. It becomes a bit too floral for my taste on my skin. Aquatic, sort of mildly green citrus with an ambery floral dry down. Good performance.


Mid Row:

Eros Flame: Really like this one. The rest of the Eros line didn’t really catch my eye and I found them just a little bit too immature for what I enjoy. Flame, on the other hand, was an immediate win. Spicy orange opening with a heavy woody vanilla dry down where the spices linger as the orange slowly fades away. Extremely unique in my opinion, and is absolutely nuclear performance-wise. Put 3 sprays on at 9 am one day and had someone standing probably 5 feet away from me compliment me on it at 7 pm that evening.

Valentino Green Stravaganza: I will not tolerate the hate this frag gets. Absolutely fantastic scent. Sweet, semi-citrusy with an amazingly done coffee note and a great vetiver backing. Performance is solid for me too. This is a smell that just sort of makes me feel happy when I get a whiff. The coffee-vetiver combo also makes this pack enough of a punch that it can be work in cold weather too, despite appearing to be a more warm-weather frag.

Coach Green: I have never smelled PDM Greenley, however this is exactly what I’d imagine it smells like from what I’ve heard. Super fresh, clean, green apple-kiwi vibes with some light woodiness creeping into the dry down. Lasts surprisingly long too. Peak spring-summer scent and very uplifting.

Bottom Row:

Givenchy Gentleman’s Society Extreme: Favourite scent in my rotation. Powdery, minty, woody vanilla greatness. The opening is potent, but the dry down will make you ascend. Lasts forever on me and smells like pure class and sophistication in my opinion. Better than the regular G-Society imo. The coffee note doesn’t come through much, but definitely adds a little something.

Montblanc Explorer: Most people probably know what this smells like. Aromatic citrus with a lot of woodiness. Very easy yet sophisticated wear. I’ve heard many comments on its bad performance, but to be dead honest, this lasts literally forever on me. I can smell this even after a shower at times. Not sure why.

Prada Carbon: Lots of people compare this to Sauvage, however I honestly don’t get that at all. Smells very different in my opinion. Heavy on the lavender which I love, a bit synthetic but in a really good way somehow, and is surprisingly quite sweet. A very “classic” masculine smell. Smells a lot like barbicide to me actually.

Yesterday, while I was talking to her, her replies were delayed by 30 seconds to a minute. I assumed she was using her phone for something else during our conversation. For context, I work and go to school, so I don’t have much free time. When I do, I really want to spend it talking to her.

Yesterday, I was working alone at a coffee shop, and there were no customers throughout the day. I was messaging her, trying to have a conversation, but her replies were short and delayed—things like “yes,” “no,” or “okay”—which made me feel like she wasn’t interested in talking. I had a strong feeling she was using YouTube or Facebook during this time.

That evening, after logging out from work, I called her. I asked her to be honest with me and admitted that I felt like she was using YouTube or Facebook while we were talking. She admitted that she was. I got upset because, in the past, when we first started talking, I used to do the same thing, but when she told me it bothered her, I stopped and gave her my full attention during our conversations. It hurt to see her doing something she had previously asked me not to do.

I told her I wanted to have an honest conversation, and she agreed. We talked through a video call, and I asked if she was starting to lose interest in me. She admitted that she was. My world shattered upon hearing that. I asked her if she still loved me, and she said yes.

I told her I was disappointed and hurt by her answer. I explained that when someone starts losing interest in their partner, love often fades next. I even reminded her of her past relationship, asking her to think about what she felt before breaking up with her ex. I pointed out that she probably felt a loss of interest first, which eventually led to the end of that relationship.

I started to sound like I was about to break up with her, and she began crying, saying she didn’t want to break up. I reassured her that I wasn’t breaking up with her. Now it’s 3:52 AM, and I’m wondering if I did the right thing by giving her another chance.

I’m pretty sure she’s losing interest in me, especially because whenever I suggest new things for us to do together, she always says no. Ironically, she mentioned that one of the reasons for her loss of interest is that we’re doing the same things every day. I never called her out on this contradiction, but it’s frustrating because I’m trying to make changes while she refuses to try new things.

I started with one cold coffee in the morning then eventually went to Lipton diet green tea and zero sugar sodas. I was drinking around 100-200mg per day of caffeine for several months. I noticed it was giving me anxiety and affecting my quality of life so I decided to quit cold turkey.  

The first two days felt like a major crash, zero energy, lethargic and depressed.  The third day my energy came back but along with it came horrible anxiety and intrusive thoughts along with insomnia. I couldn't sleep longer then a couple hours. My brain felt like it was buzzing. I had trouble watching tv or dealing with any kind of issues. I would wake up in the middle of the night feeling this awful fear/anxiety. This went of for two full weeks. 

I noticed lifting weights would clear the anxiety away so I would work out every night or during the day when the anxiety got bad. After 3 weeks or so I started to have good days. Days without any anxiety.  Then eventually I started having  2 or 3 days in a row without anxiety. My sleep started to get better.  I was forcing my self to sleep 7-8 hours. I noticed if I got less then 7 hours it would trigger anxiety.

1hwt6c6,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/1hwt6c6/five_years_of_symptoms/,Five years of symptoms,"ello all! Looking for some insight as to what this could possibly be. I am a 31F, and I take Buspar and Sertraline, plus Rosuvastatin for medications. Of note, I had a previous 3.4 cm cyst on my left ovary, and my mom passed away pretty traumatically 5 years ago. I am receiving therapy for grief, and I have an anxiety disorder. 

For the past five-ish years, I have been having lower abdominal pain. It’s crampy, usually, and it feels like it is focused in and or around my hips. I was initially told it was anxiety, and I should “be less anxious.” When this did not work, I was referred to OB by my PCP multiple times — have had multiple normal transvaginal ultrasounds. Birth control also did not clear it up. I was tested for PCOS, and put on metformin which helped me lose about 20 pounds, but was taken off Metformin and told my testosterone was normal so I did not have PCOS. The OB I saw last floated an endometriosis diagnosis but discouraged surgery “just for the sake of surgery.” My periods are not normal — they are anywhere from 28 to 50 day cycles, and they are PAINFUL, but I have never gone into the ER about it because what is an ER doc going to do that I could not try at home? I have also in the past had rectal pain while having bowel movements on my period, and I have had pain with sex in the past but assumed it was me not being into it or being in a weird position. 

In the past, the abdominal pain has caused the frequency of my bowels to change, and I have occasional mucus in my stools. This lasted for about a year but cleared up on its own (this cleared up around the time I went on more anxiety medication, to be honest). I do not experience nausea or constipation, blood in my stools, or any kind of weight loss. My appetite has not changed. I do not get fevers with it either. I am able to continue working out and lifting weights. I do have lower back pain, but that has felt constant, for years. I also get hemorrhoids. 

Now, the pain has become focalized around my LLQ, near my hip. It is not painful all the time, and it feels like the pain radiates into my hip and sits there. There are occasional lightning bolts of pain in my vagina. The pain is worse at night. The pain is potentially also accompanied by pressure, but I can move and eat and poop normally. The pain feels deep, if that makes sense. I have bowel movements once or twice a day, depending on coffee consumption, and they are solid. Still no fever, no nausea, no blood in my bowel movements. I am still lifting weights. My new PCP ordered a CT scan. 

I am tired, and I am scared. Any help would be hugely appreciated. I don’t know where else to go from here. ",1,1736365945.0,WomensHealth,0,1.0,False

I'm seeking assistance gathering information on how to minimize anything harmful that I ingest or breathe in within my apartment. I know that I cannot completely eliminate VOCs and harmful materials from my living space, but I want to at least improve this. Feel free to only read and respond to **My asks**, but I included a thorough explanation of my issue below and thoughts on it due to a previous post I made receiving a skeptical response. 

**My asks (any information is helpful, including any other subreddits you think might be more useful):** 

1) Tell me everything you know about minimizing VOCs in my apartment. I want to know brands, materials, etc that I can use in place of blackout curtains (my main ask), my clothes, my mattress, and anything else that might release anything harmful that my body might react to.

2) Are there reliable, cat-friendly air purifiers that I could use for each room? I have one right next to my bed, but maybe I could get one for each room?

3) Would vacuuming more frequently help?

4) Should I make this post in other subreddits?

5) Can I be more clear with anything I'm asking? Do you need more information?

6) Tell me everything you know that I might not have thought of. I want to know all ways to reduce chemical intake as much as in the air, cooking, etc. Again, I know it is virtually impossible to completely eliminate it, but I just want as much information as I can to make informed decisions.

**My issue:**

**I am explaining this because I made a post with the above but without the below information in** r/HomeDecorating **where someone didn't answer my question but instead asked 'Why in the world would you think the curtains have anything to do with this'. Therefore, here are my notes on the issue. You do not need to read below if you can answer my questions above****:**

Over the past couple of years, I've been getting morning headaches. Sometimes I would dream about the headaches and then wake up with more severe versions of them, but generally I'd just wake up with a mild to moderate headache, which would fade as the day goes on. I initially could not easily explain the cause of these. 

This started the morning after I put up some blackout curtains. When I would travel and sleep in a room without blackout curtains, I would feel much better in the mornings (CO -> WI/MN).

I also just today noticed that I got a moderate headache (5/10, came along with a dream headache) after sleeping in my hoodie (100% polyester). I had previously occasionally slept in sweatshirts, and I realized that the only ones I remember getting morning headaches with are the 100% polyester ones. I have slept in other sweatshirts when the headaches have not happened. I cannot remember if the headaches have happened every time, but I do believe it's only been with the polyester ones. 

**Solutions I've explored and their results:**

1) Washing the blackout curtains (done a couple of times over the course of a few months): This seems to have had a slight effect on my headaches. I would not get them as frequently or intensely after washing them, but the headaches would eventually come back to mild/moderate after awhile.

2) Carbon monoxide detector: I got one of these in my bedroom; it's always shown a reading of 0. I suppose this could be a malfunction, but I'm going to assume it's working correctly (purchased one with pretty solid reviews).

3) Drinking lots of water: This has had mixed results and even furthers my confusion regarding how my body processes things. I went from drinking about 3 quarts of water per day to about 6 quarts of water per day, drinking about 1-2 quarts right before sleeping when doing 6 quarts per day. This has sometimes seemed to decrease or eliminate the headaches (enough for it to be noticeable); however, this did not seem to affect my sense of well-being during travel to WI/MN (I didn't have the headaches during travel anyway), and it wasn't quite 100% effective, just moderately. Also (possibly related), no matter how much water I drink, I always seem to be dehydrated in the morning looking at my urine, and I rarely get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, weirdly. Piggybacking onto this, my kidney lab values have been mostly fine; I have occasionally had very slightly high creatinine, urea, and chlorine values over the years, but these are usually within a normal range.

4) Sleeping without a hoodie on for long periods of time. This has lowered my headache frequency slightly. I don't think it's the only cause (if one at all). I never sweat in them or seem to overheat. When I have overheated in some WI/CO summers overnight I haven't had any noticeable symptoms. Therefore, I don't think overheating has contributed to my headaches. 

**Other things I've ruled out:**

1) Elevation difference between CO and MN/WI: I moved from WI to CO in 2018 and never had any issues with the elevation. I believe elevation difference is not the cause.

2) I do not have any seasonal allergies, nor do I have any food allergies (at least major ones that I immediately notice).

**Other observations (most are probably un-related, but I'm being as thorough as I can be here):**

1) I had semi-frequently gotten similar headaches when I had taken melatonin (usually 2-3mg) for some previous sleep issues. I no longer take these though since I do not want my brain to become reliant on supplemental melatonin overtime, my sleep is okay as of now, and my pineal gland has been shown to be normal on a brain MRI. This is not an issue currently, but I figured I'd include it for completeness.

2) I sometimes get similar headaches when I wake up during REM cycles.

3) I tend to get these headaches more frequently the next morning when I have screen-related headaches and go to sleep with them.

4) Waking up with coffee frequently (though not always) helps eliminate or mitigate the headaches. This is whether I drink water before or after coffee. I do try drinking 16oz of water before any coffee.

5) This could maybe be partially due to changes in weather patterns. It snowed here for the first time in awhile yesterday (not sure about any pressure changes), and I got a moderate morning headache. I think this is unlikely, but maybe it's partially related and can exacerbate symptoms?

6) I just got back into strength training at the gym yesterday. Maybe the edema from micro-tears in my muscles is partially contributing since I got a headache this morning? 

7) Could this be a hormonal and/or age issue (34M)?

8)  I've seen numerous specialists for various symptoms I've had, including weird headaches/migraines probably unrelated to my morning headaches. The only thing that's out of the ordinary is a benign possible micro-adenoma (or Rathke's cyst) in my pituitary that my neurosurgeon is not concerned about. Other specialists that I've seen for other probably un-related symptoms have been in cardiology, orthopedics, urology, and dermatology. Nothing is out of the ordinary in those body systems.

[Breville Barista Express],"I bought a brand new BBE for my girlfriend for Christmas and we just got back in town and set it up the other day. Despite repeatedly adjusting coarseness (between 5 and 10 as recommended) and grind amount, we can't seem to get a good pour of espresso that pulls for \~25 seconds in the appropriate pressure range. Either it dribbles out far too slowly (which I have learned may indicate too fine of a grind) or pours out much too fast; either way all the espresso the machine has produced thus far has been off in taste, and often in color as well (pure black at the beginning of the pour). Any advice as to what we're doing wrong here? The one thing I could come up with is maybe the amount of grounds the machine produces isn't quite right. I just ordered a kitchen scale so we can weigh grounds in the future.",0,1736364888.0,espresso,2,0.5,False

The KSM-66 extract consists of 5% whithanolides, whereas the leaf and root extract consists of 1.5% whithanolides. Hence, I estimate that a single capsule contains the equivalent of 325mg of KSM-66 extract (100\*((0.015\*250 + 0.05\*150)/5) = 325), that two contain the equivalent of 650mg, and that three contain the equivalent of 975mg. Thus, I intend to consume three capsules each weekday, a single capsule each day of a weekend, and I plan to take a week-long break after each three-week period from today. ***Is this a reasonable assessment and plan?***

**My experience.** I consumed two capsules at 8 AM, having eaten breakfast already. At 10 PM, I felt some slight discomfort in my stomach, which subsided entirely after I drank some water. I felt somewhat relieved after 2 PM. I consumed the thrird capsule at 4 PM. I drank some coffee at 5 PM. I have been feeling rather relaxed since 6 PM. I did not become highly annoyed, or irritated, when a few brief highly irritating moments took place. I have been feeling more grounded and less energetic, which I at least partially attribute to general fatigue and mental state. I want to supplement myself due to three main reasons: I am fidgety and impulsive; my productivity and quality of life are noticeably diminished by anxiety or stress; ashwagandha is known to boost cognition and executive function.

**Some relevant research.** Acute ashwagandha supplementation increased Sternberg Task-determined working memory and present reaction time after 3 and 6 hours in 13 healthy adults who had consumed 400 mg. Stress and anxiety levels were significantly lowered after 6–8 weeks of supplementation in seven trials. Some studies suggest that doses of 500–600mg are more effective than lower ones. Stress, anxiety, depression, and food craving levels were significantly lowered after 30 days of supplementation in 60 adults who either consumed 225 or 400 milligrams daily (both groups displayed improvements). Supplementation with 225 mg/day resulted in improved cognition in 59 adults.

I recognize that my dose was higher than the doses in the studies and thus I am enquiring whether I should decrease it to two capsules each weekday and whatnot.",0,1736364827.0,ASHWAGANDHA,1,0.5,False

When the recruiter slid that contract across the table, promising paychecks that would make my debt vanish and leave enough to start over, I didn’t hesitate. I didn’t ask questions. I just signed.

I told myself I didn’t have a choice. The bills were piling up. Collection agencies were circling. And I couldn’t take another late-night phone call from my sister, her voice strained as she asked when I’d be able to send money for Mom’s medical bills. I’d burned every bridge that could’ve helped me, made too many mistakes to count. This job was a lifeline, even if the rumors about the facility—the disappearances, the accidents, some sort of rift—made my stomach churn.

Ashen Blade wasn’t the kind of company you applied to; they found you. And when they did, you knew you were desperate enough to say yes. That desperation was written all over me the day I walked into their glass-paneled office, wearing a thrift store suit and clutching a résumé I hadn’t updated in years.

The recruiter didn’t even glance at it. “We don’t care where you’ve been, Mr. Vega,” he’d said, his smile just shy of human. “We care about where you’re going. And if you sign here, I promise it’ll be somewhere… better.”

Somewhere better. Funny, looking back now.

It wasn’t until my first day at the facility that I understood why they paid so well. The building itself is a monument to function over comfort, a vast, sprawling machine designed to contain… something. Most of the workers here don’t know much about the building beyond what’s written in our training manuals: Unstable anomaly. Do not approach. Follow containment protocols. Simple, right?

I’d managed to follow the rules so far, keeping my head down and my eyes on the paycheck. But nights like this make it hard to ignore the guilt gnawing at the edges of my thoughts. The things I’d done to end up here—the shortcuts, the lies, the people I hurt—they didn’t stay buried. They clung to me like shadows, whispering in the quiet moments, reminding me that I’d taken the easy way out. That I’d sold a piece of myself to get this job.

Tonight wasn’t supposed to be one of those nights, though. Tonight was just logistics: clean out some old storage units, make an inventory, and get the hell out before the rift gave me more reason to regret my choices.

The job wasn’t glamorous, but it was straightforward. Or it should’ve been. As I made my way toward the storage sector, flashlight in hand, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. The air felt denser here, like the facility itself was holding its breath. The usual hum of machinery sounded deeper, almost like it was vibrating in my chest. And the lights—well, the lights in this place always flickered, but tonight they seemed worse, sputtering in and out like they were struggling to stay alive.

I glanced down the corridor ahead of me. The walls were the same dull gray steel as the rest of the facility, but something about them felt different tonight—closer, somehow, like they were pressing in on me.

“Just another shift,” I muttered under my breath, gripping the flashlight tighter. I’d been telling myself that for six months now, but tonight, the words felt hollow.

I took a step forward, my boots clanging against the grated floor. The sound echoed down the corridor, sharp and hollow, swallowed by the silence that seemed to stretch forever.

I don’t know why I stopped, but something in the back of my mind told me to listen. And that’s when I realized: the air wasn’t just heavy. It was… wrong. There was no other way to describe it. It pressed against my skin, cold and electric, like the moments before a storm.

And in that silence, I could’ve sworn I heard something faint—just at the edge of hearing. A low, rhythmic sound, almost like a hum. Or a heartbeat.

I told myself I was imagining it, that the guilt and exhaustion were finally getting to me. But as I took another step forward, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t alone. That something was watching me. Waiting.

I pressed forward, forcing one foot in front of the other. The silence gnawed at me, every step echoing louder than it should, the sound bouncing down the corridor like a signal. My flashlight beam swept ahead, cutting through the dim light, but the shadows seemed to shift just out of reach, curling and unfurling like they were alive. It was the kind of darkness that made you feel watched—like a predator was circling just out of sight, waiting for you to stumble.

I shook my head, trying to push the thought aside. “It’s just a storage run,” I whispered, the sound of my own voice a small comfort. “Get in, get out, and—”

The hum beneath my boots deepened suddenly, a low, guttural vibration that made the floor shudder. I froze, my breath hitching. The flashlight wavered in my hand, the beam casting jagged, erratic shadows across the walls.

The vibration stopped. The silence that followed was even worse.

I swept the light ahead again, the beam catching on the faint outline of the first storage unit door. Relief washed over me—it wasn’t far. If I could just get this over with, I could be back in the break room, sipping bad coffee and pretending I didn’t feel like a rabbit caught in a trap.

But as I took another step forward, my foot caught on something. The flashlight flickered as I stumbled, the beam dipping down to the grated floor. I expected to see a loose panel or a stray tool, but instead, there was something I couldn’t quite process at first.

A smear of dark, wet streaks, glistening faintly under the light. It wasn’t oil, I realized. The color was wrong. Too deep. Too red.

My stomach churned. “Nope,” I muttered, shaking my head. “Not my problem. Not part of the job.”

But even as I said it, I knew I couldn’t leave it alone. I crouched down, shining the light along the streak. It led back down the corridor, around the corner I’d just come from. And there—at the edge of the beam—was a single boot, lying on its side like it had been discarded. Or dropped.

I stood up fast, my pulse hammering in my ears. I wanted to turn around, to pretend I hadn’t seen anything, but something about the boot stuck in my mind. It wasn’t just random equipment. It looked… new. Clean.

Like someone had been here, recently.

“Get it together, Vega,” I hissed through clenched teeth. “Just do the damn job.”

I turned back to the door, forcing myself to focus. The handle was cold and slick under my glove as I twisted it, the mechanism clicking softly. I pushed it open, shining my light into the storage unit beyond.

At first, it looked normal. Metal shelves lined the walls, stacked with crates and supplies covered in a thin layer of dust. But the air inside was different—stifling, heavy with a faint, burnt-sweet smell that made my throat tighten. My flashlight beam picked up faint scuffs on the floor, like something heavy had been dragged through recently.

I stepped inside, swallowing hard. The door creaked shut behind me, the sound echoing like a warning. I told myself it was fine. Just inventory. Just a job. I started moving down the aisles, scanning the labels on the crates, trying to keep my mind from wandering.

But it didn’t last.

The first sound was faint—a soft, rhythmic tapping. I froze, the hair on the back of my neck rising. It wasn’t coming from the walls or the floor. It was behind me.

I turned slowly, the flashlight shaking in my hand. The beam swept over the storage unit, catching nothing but shelves and crates. The tapping stopped.

“Hello?” My voice cracked, echoing back at me like a stranger’s.

No response.

I laughed nervously, the sound hollow and weak. “It’s nothing. Just your imagination.” But even as I said it, my hands tightened around the flashlight. I turned back to the crates, my eyes scanning the labels faster now, my breath coming short and shallow.

The tapping started again.

This time, it wasn’t faint. It was sharp, deliberate, and closer. Right behind me.

I spun around, the flashlight beam whipping through the air. And that’s when I saw it—just for a moment. A shadow, impossibly long, slipping around the corner of the shelves and out of sight.

My heart thundered in my chest. “Hey!” I shouted, the sound shaking the silence. “Who’s there?”

No answer.

I backed up toward the door, my eyes darting between the shelves. The air felt heavier now, pressing against my skin like the weight of the ocean. The sweet, burnt smell was stronger too, filling my lungs and making my stomach churn. My flashlight beam flickered, the light struggling to hold steady.

The tapping started again, louder, faster. It was moving now, circling the room, coming from everywhere and nowhere all at once.

And then it stopped.

I stood there, frozen, the silence pressing in on me like a physical thing. My breath hitched, my fingers numb around the flashlight.

And then I heard it.

A voice.

Faint, whispering, and achingly familiar.

“Daniel…”

The sound of my name stopped me cold. It wasn’t just a voice—it was her voice. Soft, lilting, the way it used to sound when she called me in for dinner or told me to wake up for school.

“Daniel…”

It came again, closer this time, threading through the silence like it belonged there. My chest tightened, my breath catching in my throat. The flashlight quivered in my grip, the beam jerking across the rows of crates and empty shelves. My mind screamed at me to leave, to get out of that room, but my legs wouldn’t move.

“Mom?” I whispered before I could stop myself. The word felt strange in my mouth, like it didn’t belong to me. She was gone. She’d been gone for over a year now. This couldn’t be real.

The voice didn’t answer, but it didn’t need to. The way it lingered in the air, curling around me like a thread I couldn’t see, was answer enough. It was her. I was sure of it.

I swallowed hard and took a step forward, the tapping of my boots on the grated floor sounding unnaturally loud. My flashlight’s beam flickered, the light dimming before snapping back to life. The storage room seemed to stretch in front of me, the walls pulling farther away as if I’d stepped into a space bigger than it had any right to be.

“Mom?” I said again, louder this time. My voice cracked, and I hated how small it sounded.

This time, the voice didn’t speak. It hummed. A low, gentle tune that sent a shiver down my spine. It was the same lullaby she used to sing when I was a kid, back when I couldn’t sleep. Back when I thought she could chase away the monsters under my bed just by being there.

I followed the sound, moving deeper into the room. The burnt-sweet smell grew stronger, cloying, sticking to the back of my throat like syrup. The air around me felt thicker, harder to breathe, and the faint vibration beneath my boots returned, matching the rhythm of her humming.

“Where are you?” I called out, my voice breaking. “Are you—are you here?”

No answer. Just the hum, drifting from somewhere ahead, pulling me forward.

The logical part of my brain screamed at me to stop, to turn around, to get out of there. But the rest of me—some desperate, fractured part I hadn’t let myself acknowledge since the funeral—kept moving. What if it really was her? What if I had a chance to see her again? To say all the things I didn’t get to say before she was gone?

My flashlight beam caught on something at the far end of the room—a doorway I hadn’t noticed before. It wasn’t like the other doors in the facility, with their polished steel and glowing control panels. This one was dark, its surface rough and uneven, like it had been carved out of the wall itself.

The humming was louder here, so close now that it felt like it was coming from inside me, vibrating in my chest. I reached out, my hand trembling, and pushed the door open.

The room beyond was nothing like the storage unit. The walls were no longer metal but something darker, organic, pulsing faintly under the dim green light that seeped in from somewhere above. Vein-like structures crisscrossed the walls, twisting and branching like the roots of some enormous tree. The air was heavy with that sickly-sweet smell, and the floor beneath my boots was soft, almost spongy.

“Daniel…”

The voice came again, but this time it wasn’t ahead of me. It was behind me.

I spun around, the flashlight beam cutting through the darkness. The storage room was gone. The doorway was gone. There was nothing behind me now but more of those pulsing walls, stretching endlessly in every direction.

Panic clawed at my chest. “What the hell is this?” I muttered, stumbling backward. My breath came in shallow gasps, the sound of my own heartbeat pounding in my ears. I tried to retrace my steps, but the more I moved, the more the room seemed to shift around me. The walls pulsed faster, the green light flickering like a heartbeat.

And then I saw it.

A figure stood in the distance, barely visible through the faint glow. It was small and shadowed, but there was something familiar about the way it stood, the tilt of its head.

“Mom?” My voice came out shaky, almost a whisper. I took a hesitant step forward, the spongy floor squishing beneath my boots.

The figure didn’t move, but the humming grew louder, wrapping around me like a blanket. The closer I got, the clearer the figure became. It was her. Or at least, it looked like her. She stood with her back to me, her hair the same dark curls I remembered, her shoulders hunched in that familiar way, like she was carrying the weight of the world.

“Mom?” I said again, my voice breaking. “It’s me. It’s Daniel.”

She turned slowly, her movements unnaturally smooth, like she was being pulled by invisible strings. When her face came into view, my breath caught in my throat.

It was her. Her eyes, her smile, the way she looked at me like I was still her little boy and not the mess I’d grown up to be. But there was something wrong, something I couldn’t put into words. Her eyes were too wide, her smile too still, like someone had taken a memory of her and twisted it just enough to make it wrong.

“Daniel,” she said, her voice warm and familiar. “You came back.”

I wanted to believe it was her. I wanted it so badly I could feel the ache in my chest. But the way she looked at me—the way her head tilted just a little too far, the way her voice lingered like an echo—made my stomach churn.

“I…” I hesitated, the words catching in my throat. “I missed you. I—”

Before I could finish, the walls around us shifted. The veins pulsed violently, the green light flaring like fire. Her smile widened, stretching too far, splitting the edges of her face until it wasn’t a smile anymore.

“You shouldn’t have come here,” she said, her voice warping, splitting into layers that didn’t belong to her. “You shouldn’t have looked.”

I stumbled back, my flashlight flickering wildly as the figure that wasn’t my mother began to dissolve, its shape twisting into something darker, something formless.

And then the voice came again—not hers this time, but mine.

“Daniel…” it whispered, soft and mocking. “You’re already home.”

I woke with a start, gasping for air, the cold metal of the storage unit floor biting into my back. My flashlight lay beside me, its beam weak and sputtering, casting long shadows that seemed to dance across the walls. For a moment, I didn’t move, my chest heaving, my body trembling. The last thing I remembered was—her. That voice. That smile.

But it couldn’t have been real. None of it could’ve been real.

My hand shot to my chest, my fingers curling around the fabric of my uniform as if to anchor myself. The heavy scent of burnt sweetness still lingered, clawing at the back of my throat. I pushed myself upright, the grated floor creaking beneath me. The room was silent now, oppressively so, broken only by the faint hum of the facility’s systems in the distance.

I glanced around, the dim flashlight beam tracing over the storage unit. The shelves were still there, the crates stacked neatly, the metal walls cold and unyielding. Everything was exactly as it had been when I’d first entered.

But something was wrong.

The door I’d entered through was open, but it felt… different. It was too still, too perfect, as if it had been waiting for me to notice it. My eyes darted to the floor, searching for the strange marks I’d seen—the dark streaks, the boot. Nothing. Just smooth, unmarked metal.

I swallowed hard, my throat dry. “No,” I whispered to myself, shaking my head. “It was real. I saw it. I heard her.”

But the more I spoke, the less certain I felt. The memories of what had just happened—the green light, the pulsing walls, her face—were slipping away, unraveling like threads pulled from a frayed rope. The harder I tried to hold onto them, the more they dissolved, leaving only fragments. A shadow here. A whisper there. Her eyes, wide and unnatural, staring into mine.

I grabbed the flashlight and staggered to my feet, my legs weak beneath me. My heart pounded in my chest as I looked around the room again, searching for something—anything—that could prove I wasn’t losing my mind.

“Focus, Vega,” I muttered, my voice shaking. “You’re still here. You’re still… here.”

But where was here? Was I still in the storage unit? Or had I…?

The thought sent a jolt of panic through me. I stumbled toward the open door, gripping the flashlight like it was a lifeline. The hallway beyond was dim, the lights overhead flickering sporadically. I took a hesitant step forward, my boots clanging against the grated floor, and froze.

The sound echoed back at me, distorted, like it had traveled much farther than it should’ve. Too far. My stomach twisted. The corridor looked the same as it always had—cold, sterile, endless—but something about it felt wrong, like it was stretched just slightly beyond the edges of my understanding.

“Hello?” My voice cracked, the word trembling in the air. No response. Not even the faint hum of machinery I’d grown used to.

I took another step, then another, each one feeling heavier than the last. The corridor stretched ahead, impossibly long, the walls curving subtly inward as if guiding me somewhere I didn’t want to go. My flashlight flickered again, the beam growing dimmer, and I smacked it against my palm, cursing under my breath.

As I moved, the whispers started again.

Faint at first, barely audible over the sound of my own breathing. But they grew louder, more distinct, the words slipping through the cracks of my thoughts like smoke.

“Daniel…”

I froze, my breath hitching. The voice was hers again, soft and familiar, wrapping around me like a memory I couldn’t escape.

“Mom?” My voice was barely a whisper, but it echoed down the corridor like a shout.

This time, she didn’t call my name. She laughed. It was a warm, gentle laugh, the kind I remembered from long ago, when she would catch me sneaking cookies from the kitchen or trying to stay up past bedtime. But here, in the silence of the corridor, it sounded wrong. Hollow. Like someone trying to mimic her and failing.

I took a step back, my hands trembling. “You’re not real,” I said, my voice cracking. “You’re not—”

“Why did you leave us, Daniel?” The voice was closer now, cutting me off. It wasn’t just hers anymore. It was layered, fractured, echoing with tones that didn’t belong. “Why didn’t you save me?”

My flashlight sputtered and died, plunging the corridor into darkness. I swore under my breath, fumbling with the switch, but it wouldn’t turn back on. My pulse thundered in my ears as I stood there, frozen in the pitch black.

The whispers grew louder, closing in from all sides. They weren’t just hers anymore—they were mine. My own voice, distorted and mocking, overlapping with hers in a chaotic symphony.

“Why didn’t you save us, Daniel?”

“You left her. You left them. You always leave.”

“No,” I choked out, clutching the dead flashlight like it could protect me. “I didn’t—I didn’t have a choice.”

The laughter came again, sharp and piercing, cutting through the darkness. And then the whispers stopped.

The silence was deafening.

I took a shaky step forward, my hands outstretched, searching for the walls. My fingers brushed against cold metal, but the texture shifted beneath my touch, softening, pulsing. I jerked my hand back, my stomach lurching.

The corridor wasn’t metal anymore. It was alive.

The whispers returned, louder now, filling my mind like a flood. I stumbled backward, tripping over my own feet and falling hard onto the floor. The impact rattled through me, but I barely felt it over the roar of the voices.

“Daniel,” they hissed, all at once. “Come home.”

And then, just as suddenly as it had started, it stopped. The voices, the laughter, the whispers—all gone.

The flashlight flickered back to life in my hand, the beam cutting through the darkness. I was back in the storage unit. The same cold, sterile walls. The same neatly stacked crates. But my heart wouldn’t stop racing, and the faint scent of burnt sweetness still lingered in the air.

I staggered to my feet, gripping the flashlight like it was the only thing tethering me to reality. My knees wobbled, and I leaned against one of the shelves for support, my breath coming in ragged gasps.

I didn’t know what was real anymore.

But I knew one thing: I wasn’t alone in here. And whatever was watching me, whatever was waiting, wasn’t done with me yet.

I leaned against the cold metal shelf, gripping it so tightly my knuckles went white. My flashlight’s beam wavered over the walls, shaking with the tremor in my hands. I tried to tell myself it was over, that I was just exhausted, that the whispers and the shadowy things were some trick of stress and adrenaline. But I didn’t believe it. Not for a second.

The room felt alive—watching, breathing, waiting. The air was heavy, suffocating, and that burnt-sweet smell was stronger now, clawing its way into my lungs. Every fiber of my being screamed at me to get out, but I couldn’t move. Not yet. Not when my thoughts were boiling over, flooding my mind with guilt I didn’t ask for.

“It’s not my fault,” I whispered hoarsely, the words tasting bitter on my tongue. “I didn’t have a choice. I didn’t—I couldn’t save her.”

The sound of my own voice was small and fragile, swallowed by the room’s oppressive silence. My chest heaved as I tried to catch my breath, the memories clawing their way to the surface. The hospital room, the sterile white walls, the machines hooked up to her frail, unrecognizable body. The way she’d looked at me in those final days—not with anger, not with blame, but with sadness. Like she knew I’d failed her.

“I tried,” I said, louder now, as if the walls themselves needed to hear me. “I tried, but there was nothing I could do! What was I supposed to do, huh? Magic money out of thin air? Cure her myself?”

The words echoed back at me, hollow and cruel. I clenched my fists, my nails digging into my palms as the anger surged, hot and bitter. “It wasn’t my fault,” I said again, spitting the words like venom. “I had to take the job. I had to. She’s gone, and it’s not my—”

A sound cut through the silence, sharp and grating. I froze, the anger draining from me in an instant. It started as a soft scraping, like nails dragging across metal, but it grew louder, closer, more deliberate.

It was coming from the far corner of the storage unit.

The beam of my flashlight trembled as I swung it toward the sound. The crates at the far end seemed to shift under the light, their edges blurring, distorting. The scraping stopped, replaced by a low, wet slithering noise that made my stomach turn.

My breath caught as something moved—a shadow, impossibly large, sliding across the floor. It stretched and twisted like smoke, its edges flickering in and out of existence, but it had weight. I could hear it dragging itself toward me, the floor creaking under its presence.

“No,” I whispered, taking a step back. My legs felt like jelly, my heart hammering against my ribs. “No, this isn’t real. This isn’t—”

The shadow stopped. For a moment, everything was still, the air so thick it felt like I was breathing through a straw.

And then it rose.

The shadow began to stretch upward, unraveling into a towering, amorphous shape that scraped the ceiling. Tendrils of darkness spilled out from its edges, writhing and twitching like they were alive. The flashlight flickered violently as the thing took shape, its form coalescing into something almost human—a long, twisted torso with too many arms, its face an empty void that seemed to drink in the light.

I stumbled backward, my back hitting the shelves. My flashlight slipped from my grasp, clattering to the floor and spinning wildly, casting distorted shadows that only made the thing look worse.

The void where its face should’ve been tilted toward me, and then it spoke.

“Daniel…” The voice was hers again—my mother’s. But it wasn’t her. It was layered, warped, a grotesque mockery of the voice I’d loved. “You left me. You always leave.”

“No,” I choked out, shaking my head violently. “No, I didn’t—I didn’t leave you! There was nothing I could do!”

The thing moved closer, its many arms reaching out, the tendrils dragging along the floor with a sick, wet sound.

“You could have tried harder,” it hissed, its voice shifting, breaking apart into a dozen others. Some of them were familiar—hers, mine, others I couldn’t place—but they all spoke with the same venomous certainty. “You didn’t care enough.”

“I did!” I shouted, my voice cracking. “I cared! I did everything I could! Don’t you think I wanted to save her? Don’t you think I would’ve given anything—everything—to make it stop?”

The thing stopped just short of me, its many arms trembling, twisting into shapes I couldn’t understand. Its void-like face leaned closer, so close I could feel the cold radiating off of it.

“Then why,” it whispered, its voice soft and deadly, “are you here, and she’s not?”

I couldn’t answer. The words lodged in my throat, choking me, as the guilt I’d buried for so long rose like bile. My knees buckled, and I sank to the floor, trembling.

“I didn’t mean to…” I whispered, tears burning in my eyes. “I didn’t mean to leave her…”

The thing leaned closer still, its void-face inches from mine. Its many arms reached out, brushing against my shoulders, my face, my chest. The touch was cold, invasive, like it was peeling away layers of me, searching for something I didn’t want to give.

“You belong to me now,” it said, the voices blending into a single, inhuman tone. “You’ll never leave.”

The tendrils wrapped around me, pulling me closer, tighter, suffocating me in their icy grip. My vision blurred as the green light I thought I’d left behind seeped into the edges of my sight, pulsing, twisting, dragging me down into the dark.

And then I screamed.

The tendrils tightened around me, dragging me deeper into the cold, suffocating dark. My scream echoed and then vanished, swallowed by the void as the thing’s many voices murmured and hissed in my ears. I felt myself unraveling, piece by piece—my thoughts scattering, my memories slipping through my fingers like sand. The walls of the world fell away, and for a moment, there was nothing but the pulsing green light, rhythmic and alive, beating like a heart.

I thought it was over. I wanted it to be over.

But then I woke up.

The first thing I felt was the floor—cold, smooth, vibrating faintly under my hands. Not the grated metal of the storage unit, but something else entirely. My breath came in shallow gasps as I opened my eyes, squinting against the harsh green light that filled the space around me.

I was lying on my back in a vast, cavernous chamber, the ceiling so high it disappeared into the glow. The walls were alive with movement—writhing tendrils and vein-like structures pulsing with that same sickly green light. They twisted and coiled, merging and splitting, shifting like they were breathing. The air was thick and heavy, charged with an electric hum that thrummed through my chest like a second heartbeat.

I sat up slowly, my body aching, my mind reeling. The chamber stretched endlessly in all directions, its floor a seamless expanse of dark, glassy material that reflected the faint glow above. In the center of it all was a tear, a rift.

It wasn’t just a crack in the fabric of reality, like I’d imagined from the containment protocols. It was massive—a towering, pulsating mass of light and shadow, twisting and churning in impossible patterns. Tendrils of green energy snaked outward from its core, coiling into the walls, the floor, the very air itself. Looking at it made my stomach churn, my vision blur, as if my mind couldn’t fully grasp what I was seeing.

I scrambled backward, my palms slipping on the smooth floor, but no matter how far I moved, the rift loomed over me, pulling at me with an invisible force. Its presence was overwhelming, suffocating, like it was pressing into every corner of my mind, whispering things I couldn’t understand.

“This… this can’t be real,” I muttered, my voice shaking. But even as I said it, I knew it was. The burnt-sweet smell was back, stronger than ever, clinging to my skin and filling my lungs. My body trembled as the rift pulsed again, the green light flaring brighter, casting long, twisting shadows across the chamber.

A sound echoed through the space—a low, resonant groan that seemed to come from the rift itself. It wasn’t just a noise; it was a presence, a weight that pressed down on me, threatening to crush me where I sat. The air vibrated with its power, and I felt it in my bones, in my teeth, in my thoughts.

“Daniel…”

The voice came again, but this time it wasn’t a whisper. It was a roar, layered and fragmented, shaking the chamber and rattling my skull. It came from everywhere and nowhere, filling the space like it had always been there, waiting for me.

I clamped my hands over my ears, but it didn’t help. The voice wasn’t just in the air—it was inside me, burrowing into my mind, pulling at the fragile pieces of my sanity.

“You’ve always belonged here,” it said, the words vibrating through me. “You’ve always been mine.”

“No!” I shouted, my voice breaking. “I don’t belong to you! I—I didn’t ask for this!”

The rift pulsed again, and the light dimmed for a moment, casting the chamber into an eerie half-darkness. Shadows moved along the walls, twisting into shapes I couldn’t understand—faces, hands, fragments of things that shouldn’t exist. They reached toward me, their forms flickering and dissolving like smoke, but I could feel their presence, their hunger.

“You left her,” the voice said, shifting, warping. “You left everyone. And now you’re here.”

“I didn’t leave her!” I screamed, my voice raw. “I didn’t—I didn’t mean to…”

The rift flared violently, the green light washing over me, burning into my eyes. My memories surged forward, unbidden—my mother in the hospital bed, her hand weak and trembling in mine. The last conversation I’d had with her, the way I’d promised to do better, to fix things, to come back.

And then I’d left.

I pressed my hands to my temples, shaking my head, trying to block out the memories, the light, the voice. “It wasn’t my fault,” I whispered, the words crumbling in my throat. “It wasn’t my fault…”

The rift seemed to laugh, its energy rippling through the chamber like a wave. The tendrils around me began to shift, moving closer, curling inward. One of them stretched toward me, stopping just short of my chest. It hovered there, pulsing faintly, as if waiting for me to acknowledge it.

And then it spoke—not in words, but in images. Memories.

I saw myself, younger, sitting at my mother’s bedside, my head bowed, her voice faint but kind as she told me it wasn’t my fault, that I’d done all I could. But the memory shifted, twisting. Her face blurred, her voice warping into something darker. “You let me go,” she said, her voice cold and sharp. “You left me alone.”

“No,” I whispered, tears burning in my eyes. “No, that’s not—”

The tendril lashed out, wrapping around my wrist. Its touch was cold and invasive, like it was sinking into me, pulling at the edges of my thoughts. I screamed, trying to wrench my arm free, but the tendril held firm, its grip tightening.

“You are mine,” the rift roared, its voice shaking the chamber. “You’ve always been mine.”

The green light flared again, blinding me, and I felt myself falling—falling into the rift, into the endless, hungry void.

And then, everything went still.

When I opened my eyes, I was standing. The chamber was gone, replaced by the sterile, flickering lights of the facility corridor. My flashlight was in my hand again, its beam steady, cutting through the dimness. The air was cold and metallic, the burnt-sweet smell a faint memory.

I looked around, my heart hammering in my chest. The corridor was empty, silent, as if nothing had happened. But as I turned, my eyes caught on the reflective surface of a control panel, and my breath froze in my throat.

The face staring back at me wasn’t mine.

Not entirely.

“Daniel…. Thank you.”
BREAKING NEWS: Ashen Blade Industries Unveils Revolutionary Product Amid Tragedy

January 7, 2025 — By Catherine Hayes, Associated Press

Ashen Blade Industries, the global leader in advanced energy solutions and defense technologies, announced today the launch of their latest product, the PulseCore Reactor. Touted as a groundbreaking leap in sustainable energy, the reactor promises to revolutionize the industry with its unparalleled efficiency and near-limitless output.

The unveiling comes amid heightened public interest in Ashen Blade’s activities, though the company has remained characteristically tight-lipped about the specifics of the reactor’s development. CEO Marcus Feldman called the project “a triumph of innovation and dedication” during a press conference earlier this morning.

“This is the culmination of years of tireless work by the brilliant minds at Ashen Blade,” Feldman stated. “The PulseCore Reactor will redefine the future of energy, ushering in an era of unprecedented progress.”

However, the celebratory mood surrounding the announcement has been tempered by a dark and disturbing development involving one of the company’s employees.

Employee Linked to Shocking Killing Spree

Authorities have issued an urgent manhunt for Daniel Vega, a junior logistics officer at Ashen Blade Industries, who is suspected of committing a series of brutal murders over the past week. Vega, 29, was last seen at the company’s remote containment facility in the northern sector, where he had been assigned routine inventory work.

Since then, Vega has been implicated in the deaths of at least nine individuals, including coworkers and security personnel. Investigators describe the killings as “unimaginably violent,” with evidence suggesting a deliberate and methodical approach. Many of the victims were reportedly found with severe injuries, though details remain scarce as the investigation continues.

Chief Investigator Sarah Morton addressed the media late last night, describing Vega as “highly dangerous” and warning the public to remain vigilant.

“Daniel Vega is still at large,” Morton stated. “He should not be approached under any circumstances. If you see him, contact law enforcement immediately.”

Questions Surround Ashen Blade’s Role

Ashen Blade Industries has yet to issue an official statement regarding Vega’s actions or how he was able to evade detection for so long. Some reports suggest Vega may have been suffering from acute psychological distress in the days leading up to the murders, though the company has refused to confirm these claims.

When asked about the incidents during this morning’s press conference, CEO Marcus Feldman offered a brief response.

“This is a tragedy for everyone involved,” Feldman said. “We are cooperating fully with law enforcement and will continue to provide our utmost support during this investigation.”

A Frightening Unknown

Despite the company’s assurances, questions remain about Vega’s motives and the exact circumstances leading up to the killings. Those who knew him describe Vega as quiet and unassuming, with no prior history of violence.

“He wasn’t the kind of guy you’d expect this from,” one coworker, speaking anonymously, told reporters. “I don’t understand it. None of us do.”

As the manhunt continues, speculation about Vega’s whereabouts grows. Some believe he’s still hiding within the sprawling containment facility, while others suggest he may have fled into the nearby wilderness.

For now, one thing is certain: Daniel Vega, once an ordinary logistics officer, is now one of the most wanted men in the country. And the chilling mystery of what happened inside that facility—and why—remains unanswered.

I’ve been working remotely for a while now, and I wanted to share a few things that have made my life SO much easier. Honestly, at first, I struggled, switching from the office to home wasn’t a smooth transition for me (i like to socialize a lot and i still do and miss it sometimes but then i remember the comfort ahah). But over time, I’ve found a few changes that have really helped me get more comfortable and productive. Thought I'd share in case anyone’s struggling like I was:

# 1. I Invested in a Good Chair 🛋️

At first, I just sat on a regular kitchen chair and my back was *not* happy about it. A few months in, I caved and got an ergonomic chair. Best decision ever! My back doesn’t hurt anymore, and I feel way more comfortable.

# 2. Two Screens Are Better Than One 💻

I used to try working off just my laptop and felt super cramped. Adding a second monitor has been a game changer. Now I can keep my calendar open on one and actually work on the other without switching tabs every 2 seconds.

# 3. Creating a ""Work Zone"" Has Helped So Much 🛏️

Living in a tiny apartment means I don’t have a “real” office space, but separating my work area from my chill space (aka my couch) has helped me mentally. No more answering emails from the bed!

# 4. Short Breaks = Productivity ☕

I used to push through long hours without taking breaks, and that just made me tired and cranky. Now, I force myself to step away from the desk every hour—even if it’s just a 5-minute stretch. Honestly, it makes a huge difference in how I feel.

# 5. Staying Connected with Colleagues 💬

Remote work can be pretty isolating, so I try to check in with my coworkers more often. Whether it’s a quick Slack message or a Zoom coffee chat, staying connected has really helped me feel less alone.

# 6. Setting Boundaries to Avoid Burnout 🌟

I used to work all day and night, not realizing I was burning out until I was *totally* drained. Now I have clear start and stop times, and I’ve learned to shut down at the end of the day (even if my to-do list isn’t finished). Mental health is a huge priority.

Anyone else made any major improvements to their remote setup lately? Always wanting to improve my setup eheh

1hwsn92,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkAdvice/comments/1hwsn92/i_literally_cannot_believe_what_is_happening_to/,"I literally cannot believe what is happening to me. I was late, once. What do I do now?","Hold on to your hats here and bare with me, because that much has happened to me in the past 3 months i don’t even think you guys will believe it 😅 (happy to elaborate more to any questions responses as ill try and keep this as brief as possible. 

I work in a childcare setting and I am a preschool teacher for context.

So on the 15th of October, I was 3/4 of an hour late into work, i messaged a colleague to say i was running late. I had a phonecall before i arrived from the manager asking where i was. I said that i had a rough night but ill be in. Arrived at work nothing was said at all. At the end of preschool session i answered a phonecall on the work phone from the centre manager asking me to come upstairs for a meeting. I went straight upstairs to the meeting where I was sat down and handed a written warning. I hadn’t had a verbal warning before now so i was unsure where the written warning had come from. I was not told that I was in a disciplinary scenario so I was unable to prepare or potentially bring another staff member into the meeting with me. The centre manager had said there had been an issue with my lateness and that she had a log. I asked her if I could see the log to which she couldn’t provide me. Naturally, I said I am not signing anything if you can’t provide evidence. Her response was ‘do you know what your problem is, you don’t take accountability for your actions’ my response was “how can I take accountability for something you can’t provide evidence for?” She told me to stop shouting at her and that i was behaving like a child. This was all because i didn’t sign the warning.

My son attends the setting and was downstairs in the daycare room during the time of the meeting. When I exited the meeting I went downstairs to collect my son to take him home as it was already the end of my shift, a member of staff asked me if I was okay to which I responded “I cannot talk right now” I was continually pressed for a response until the childcare manager asked me if I was okay and if I wanted to step out of the room to speak, I said to her “you are the reason I was in that meeting I do not want to speak to you” I got my son and I left.

The following morning I woke up and in my inbox was a copy of the written warning and a email saying that I had been suspended pending investigation. I had safeguarding policies posted through my door highlighting all the areas of abuse and when I asked the centre manager for her line manager’s details so that I could report her, she did not provide me with the information that I needed. 

It took four weeks until I even had my first meeting with anybody and I still hadn’t had my own statement taken. Two statements were put in against me. However, they carried out the investigation and on the very first meeting I had with them told me that I was on my final written warning. Obviously completely confused. I said I have absolutely no idea where any of this is coming from however the line manager did agree that I should never have been put in the written warning disciplinary scenario and upheld my appeal to get that off of my record, however, the suspension still was in place. 

I asked for a copies of the statements under an access request. I read both of them. The two statements could not have been more different but both with horrible accusations. It turns out the biggest allegation made against me was aggression against my own son to which I asked why there wasn’t an incident report filed and also why the local officer (LADO) wasn’t made aware of the incident either. Because such accusations means the social services would’ve been at my doorstep. I was accused of throwing my son’s belongings across the room and breaking them as well as well dumping my son on the floor and that i scared all the other children in the room (absolutely none of this happened)

I eventually had another meeting six weeks into my suspension where my statement was heard and I provided all of the belongings that was said to be broken and they compared the two statements next to one another and said they would come back to me with a response. 

The childcare manager that investigated the incident nt left the position before there was an outcome. So there is a new childcare manager who was very much on neutral ground at least i thought. After speaking to her about my suspension and how I had been treated and that I didn’t understand why I have been treated the way I had been, and why such ludicrous allegations had been made, her response was ‘it must just be you English people, I live in work in Northern Ireland. 

I fought with lots of letters and appeals and the final outcome was that they reinstated the verbal warning for me being late that morning and they said that they still had to action something because although the statements didn’t align, they said I still created an atmosphere, which was a verbal warning for code of conduct. I did say that I wanted my records to be clear but I wanted to return to work as at this point, I had been out of work for seven weeks at this point with little to no support or signposting or updates. 

I was assured that I could hold my head high and return to work knowing that I hadn’t done anything wrong and that I would have a phased return to get myself back into the swing of things. 

I returned to work on the 3rd of December to the most unwelcoming atmosphere, nobody spoke to me or my son, my promised phased return was one day where I was in for a meeting and then I was back to my full hours which they changed without my permission, when challenged I was just told that it was what worked better for the centre. My work laptop had been given to somebody else, my job role had changed entirely and the excuse I was given was that she wasn’t or isn’t the old manager. And upon returning to my room I noticed that the health and safety of the room was not acceptable as the store cupboard had not been taken care of whilst I was away and was a risk to the children and adults as things could fall on them. When I brought this up at the staff meeting the very next day the manager said that her priority were the children and not a cupboard, she said this to me in front of all of the staff. My register was nowhere to be found one morning and when I requested it, they weren’t actively looking for it. The next thing I know they have pulled a fire drill on me which I said they weren’t going to do to me and with the managers permission I left that morning as I no longer felt safe.

Since then there is been a weekly phone call from the new manager just taking boxes and it is clear she is making no effort to reintegrate me back to the workplace. I am currently on sick leave since that incident due to stress at work and I cannot understand the effect that this has had on my mental health. On the last day of term my manager removed me from the work group chat and messaged me afterwards saying that she did that to give me a break because of my mental health. I said that it was another opportunity to exclude me and alienate me from the rest of the group and she said she would speak to the staff members and let them know the reason for why she removed me. I asked her if I’d received any presents from the parents to which she said that I had and she was going to deliver them the following week.

The presents were never delivered and we fast forward to Friday, the 3rd of January where I was called into a meeting to just catch up, I said that since I returned to work people have since blocked and removed me on social media which surprised me as I hadn’t done anything wrong. I since found out one of the girls who put in a statement against me had said to other members of staff a completely different version of events. When i brought this up with the manager that she was clearly lying,  which is gross misconduct. I was told she was protected by HR because she is pregnant.. 

And finally, the cherry on top of all of this is a parent had asked me if I liked what they had brought me for Christmas, I said that I’d only just received the presents but they were all a little bit jumbled up, what was in the gift bag? They said that I should’ve received a gingerbread man with sweets, a bottle of wine, some chocolates, some hot chocolate sachets and a sachet of coffee. The only thing I received out of that gift bag that was addressed directly to me, was a sachet of coffee. I messaged my manager this afternoon saying that unless I received that gift bag with all of the contents in it as described that I would be reporting them for theft to not only the police but also social services.

Ive only been in this job since 22nd Feb 2024 so not long enough to sue for constructive dismissal, but surely this is a case within itself? They’ve had to hire someone externally to rewrite all of their policies because they cant stand over them for they i have been treated. If anyone could give me a golden nugget of information here it would be much appreciated, and thank you for reading if you got this far! Please help if you can, my anxiety has been through the roof. Im getting married in less than four months and instead of writing vows i’m writing grievances 🙁",2,1736364616.0,WorkAdvice,0,1.0,False
1hwsn14,https://www.reddit.com/r/scaryjujuarmy/comments/1hwsn14/the_company_promised_to_erase_my_debtbut_what/,The Company Promised to Erase My Debt—But What They Took Instead Still Haunts Me.,"People like to joke about how everyone’s got a price, and Ashen Blade Industries knows exactly what yours is. When the recruiter slid that contract across the table, promising paychecks that would make my debt vanish and leave enough to start over, I didn’t hesitate. I didn’t ask questions. I just signed.

I told myself I didn’t have a choice. The bills were piling up. Collection agencies were circling. And I couldn’t take another late-night phone call from my sister, her voice strained as she asked when I’d be able to send money for Mom’s medical bills. I’d burned every bridge that could’ve helped me, made too many mistakes to count. This job was a lifeline, even if the rumors about the facility—the disappearances, the accidents, some sort of rift—made my stomach churn.

Ashen Blade wasn’t the kind of company you applied to; they found you. And when they did, you knew you were desperate enough to say yes. That desperation was written all over me the day I walked into their glass-paneled office, wearing a thrift store suit and clutching a résumé I hadn’t updated in years.

The recruiter didn’t even glance at it. “We don’t care where you’ve been, Mr. Vega,” he’d said, his smile just shy of human. “We care about where you’re going. And if you sign here, I promise it’ll be somewhere… better.”

Somewhere better. Funny, looking back now.

It wasn’t until my first day at the facility that I understood why they paid so well. The building itself is a monument to function over comfort, a vast, sprawling machine designed to contain… something. Most of the workers here don’t know much about the building beyond what’s written in our training manuals: Unstable anomaly. Do not approach. Follow containment protocols. Simple, right?

I’d managed to follow the rules so far, keeping my head down and my eyes on the paycheck. But nights like this make it hard to ignore the guilt gnawing at the edges of my thoughts. The things I’d done to end up here—the shortcuts, the lies, the people I hurt—they didn’t stay buried. They clung to me like shadows, whispering in the quiet moments, reminding me that I’d taken the easy way out. That I’d sold a piece of myself to get this job.

Tonight wasn’t supposed to be one of those nights, though. Tonight was just logistics: clean out some old storage units, make an inventory, and get the hell out before the rift gave me more reason to regret my choices.

The job wasn’t glamorous, but it was straightforward. Or it should’ve been. As I made my way toward the storage sector, flashlight in hand, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. The air felt denser here, like the facility itself was holding its breath. The usual hum of machinery sounded deeper, almost like it was vibrating in my chest. And the lights—well, the lights in this place always flickered, but tonight they seemed worse, sputtering in and out like they were struggling to stay alive.

I glanced down the corridor ahead of me. The walls were the same dull gray steel as the rest of the facility, but something about them felt different tonight—closer, somehow, like they were pressing in on me.

“Just another shift,” I muttered under my breath, gripping the flashlight tighter. I’d been telling myself that for six months now, but tonight, the words felt hollow.

I took a step forward, my boots clanging against the grated floor. The sound echoed down the corridor, sharp and hollow, swallowed by the silence that seemed to stretch forever.

I don’t know why I stopped, but something in the back of my mind told me to listen. And that’s when I realized: the air wasn’t just heavy. It was… wrong. There was no other way to describe it. It pressed against my skin, cold and electric, like the moments before a storm.

And in that silence, I could’ve sworn I heard something faint—just at the edge of hearing. A low, rhythmic sound, almost like a hum. Or a heartbeat.

I told myself I was imagining it, that the guilt and exhaustion were finally getting to me. But as I took another step forward, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t alone. That something was watching me. Waiting.

I pressed forward, forcing one foot in front of the other. The silence gnawed at me, every step echoing louder than it should, the sound bouncing down the corridor like a signal. My flashlight beam swept ahead, cutting through the dim light, but the shadows seemed to shift just out of reach, curling and unfurling like they were alive. It was the kind of darkness that made you feel watched—like a predator was circling just out of sight, waiting for you to stumble.

I shook my head, trying to push the thought aside. “It’s just a storage run,” I whispered, the sound of my own voice a small comfort. “Get in, get out, and—”

The hum beneath my boots deepened suddenly, a low, guttural vibration that made the floor shudder. I froze, my breath hitching. The flashlight wavered in my hand, the beam casting jagged, erratic shadows across the walls.

The vibration stopped. The silence that followed was even worse.

I swept the light ahead again, the beam catching on the faint outline of the first storage unit door. Relief washed over me—it wasn’t far. If I could just get this over with, I could be back in the break room, sipping bad coffee and pretending I didn’t feel like a rabbit caught in a trap.

But as I took another step forward, my foot caught on something. The flashlight flickered as I stumbled, the beam dipping down to the grated floor. I expected to see a loose panel or a stray tool, but instead, there was something I couldn’t quite process at first.

A smear of dark, wet streaks, glistening faintly under the light. It wasn’t oil, I realized. The color was wrong. Too deep. Too red.

My stomach churned. “Nope,” I muttered, shaking my head. “Not my problem. Not part of the job.”

But even as I said it, I knew I couldn’t leave it alone. I crouched down, shining the light along the streak. It led back down the corridor, around the corner I’d just come from. And there—at the edge of the beam—was a single boot, lying on its side like it had been discarded. Or dropped.

I stood up fast, my pulse hammering in my ears. I wanted to turn around, to pretend I hadn’t seen anything, but something about the boot stuck in my mind. It wasn’t just random equipment. It looked… new. Clean.

Like someone had been here, recently.

“Get it together, Vega,” I hissed through clenched teeth. “Just do the damn job.”

I turned back to the door, forcing myself to focus. The handle was cold and slick under my glove as I twisted it, the mechanism clicking softly. I pushed it open, shining my light into the storage unit beyond.

At first, it looked normal. Metal shelves lined the walls, stacked with crates and supplies covered in a thin layer of dust. But the air inside was different—stifling, heavy with a faint, burnt-sweet smell that made my throat tighten. My flashlight beam picked up faint scuffs on the floor, like something heavy had been dragged through recently.

I stepped inside, swallowing hard. The door creaked shut behind me, the sound echoing like a warning. I told myself it was fine. Just inventory. Just a job. I started moving down the aisles, scanning the labels on the crates, trying to keep my mind from wandering.

But it didn’t last.

The first sound was faint—a soft, rhythmic tapping. I froze, the hair on the back of my neck rising. It wasn’t coming from the walls or the floor. It was behind me.

I turned slowly, the flashlight shaking in my hand. The beam swept over the storage unit, catching nothing but shelves and crates. The tapping stopped.

“Hello?” My voice cracked, echoing back at me like a stranger’s.

No response.

I laughed nervously, the sound hollow and weak. “It’s nothing. Just your imagination.” But even as I said it, my hands tightened around the flashlight. I turned back to the crates, my eyes scanning the labels faster now, my breath coming short and shallow.

The tapping started again.

This time, it wasn’t faint. It was sharp, deliberate, and closer. Right behind me.

I spun around, the flashlight beam whipping through the air. And that’s when I saw it—just for a moment. A shadow, impossibly long, slipping around the corner of the shelves and out of sight.

My heart thundered in my chest. “Hey!” I shouted, the sound shaking the silence. “Who’s there?”

No answer.

I backed up toward the door, my eyes darting between the shelves. The air felt heavier now, pressing against my skin like the weight of the ocean. The sweet, burnt smell was stronger too, filling my lungs and making my stomach churn. My flashlight beam flickered, the light struggling to hold steady.

The tapping started again, louder, faster. It was moving now, circling the room, coming from everywhere and nowhere all at once.

And then it stopped.

I stood there, frozen, the silence pressing in on me like a physical thing. My breath hitched, my fingers numb around the flashlight.

And then I heard it.

A voice.

Faint, whispering, and achingly familiar.

“Daniel…”

The sound of my name stopped me cold. It wasn’t just a voice—it was her voice. Soft, lilting, the way it used to sound when she called me in for dinner or told me to wake up for school.

“Daniel…”

It came again, closer this time, threading through the silence like it belonged there. My chest tightened, my breath catching in my throat. The flashlight quivered in my grip, the beam jerking across the rows of crates and empty shelves. My mind screamed at me to leave, to get out of that room, but my legs wouldn’t move.

“Mom?” I whispered before I could stop myself. The word felt strange in my mouth, like it didn’t belong to me. She was gone. She’d been gone for over a year now. This couldn’t be real.

The voice didn’t answer, but it didn’t need to. The way it lingered in the air, curling around me like a thread I couldn’t see, was answer enough. It was her. I was sure of it.

I swallowed hard and took a step forward, the tapping of my boots on the grated floor sounding unnaturally loud. My flashlight’s beam flickered, the light dimming before snapping back to life. The storage room seemed to stretch in front of me, the walls pulling farther away as if I’d stepped into a space bigger than it had any right to be.

“Mom?” I said again, louder this time. My voice cracked, and I hated how small it sounded.

This time, the voice didn’t speak. It hummed. A low, gentle tune that sent a shiver down my spine. It was the same lullaby she used to sing when I was a kid, back when I couldn’t sleep. Back when I thought she could chase away the monsters under my bed just by being there.

I followed the sound, moving deeper into the room. The burnt-sweet smell grew stronger, cloying, sticking to the back of my throat like syrup. The air around me felt thicker, harder to breathe, and the faint vibration beneath my boots returned, matching the rhythm of her humming.

“Where are you?” I called out, my voice breaking. “Are you—are you here?”

No answer. Just the hum, drifting from somewhere ahead, pulling me forward.

The logical part of my brain screamed at me to stop, to turn around, to get out of there. But the rest of me—some desperate, fractured part I hadn’t let myself acknowledge since the funeral—kept moving. What if it really was her? What if I had a chance to see her again? To say all the things I didn’t get to say before she was gone?

My flashlight beam caught on something at the far end of the room—a doorway I hadn’t noticed before. It wasn’t like the other doors in the facility, with their polished steel and glowing control panels. This one was dark, its surface rough and uneven, like it had been carved out of the wall itself.

The humming was louder here, so close now that it felt like it was coming from inside me, vibrating in my chest. I reached out, my hand trembling, and pushed the door open.

The room beyond was nothing like the storage unit. The walls were no longer metal but something darker, organic, pulsing faintly under the dim green light that seeped in from somewhere above. Vein-like structures crisscrossed the walls, twisting and branching like the roots of some enormous tree. The air was heavy with that sickly-sweet smell, and the floor beneath my boots was soft, almost spongy.

“Daniel…”

The voice came again, but this time it wasn’t ahead of me. It was behind me.

I spun around, the flashlight beam cutting through the darkness. The storage room was gone. The doorway was gone. There was nothing behind me now but more of those pulsing walls, stretching endlessly in every direction.

Panic clawed at my chest. “What the hell is this?” I muttered, stumbling backward. My breath came in shallow gasps, the sound of my own heartbeat pounding in my ears. I tried to retrace my steps, but the more I moved, the more the room seemed to shift around me. The walls pulsed faster, the green light flickering like a heartbeat.

And then I saw it.

A figure stood in the distance, barely visible through the faint glow. It was small and shadowed, but there was something familiar about the way it stood, the tilt of its head.

“Mom?” My voice came out shaky, almost a whisper. I took a hesitant step forward, the spongy floor squishing beneath my boots.

The figure didn’t move, but the humming grew louder, wrapping around me like a blanket. The closer I got, the clearer the figure became. It was her. Or at least, it looked like her. She stood with her back to me, her hair the same dark curls I remembered, her shoulders hunched in that familiar way, like she was carrying the weight of the world.

“Mom?” I said again, my voice breaking. “It’s me. It’s Daniel.”

She turned slowly, her movements unnaturally smooth, like she was being pulled by invisible strings. When her face came into view, my breath caught in my throat.

It was her. Her eyes, her smile, the way she looked at me like I was still her little boy and not the mess I’d grown up to be. But there was something wrong, something I couldn’t put into words. Her eyes were too wide, her smile too still, like someone had taken a memory of her and twisted it just enough to make it wrong.

“Daniel,” she said, her voice warm and familiar. “You came back.”

I wanted to believe it was her. I wanted it so badly I could feel the ache in my chest. But the way she looked at me—the way her head tilted just a little too far, the way her voice lingered like an echo—made my stomach churn.

“I…” I hesitated, the words catching in my throat. “I missed you. I—”

Before I could finish, the walls around us shifted. The veins pulsed violently, the green light flaring like fire. Her smile widened, stretching too far, splitting the edges of her face until it wasn’t a smile anymore.

“You shouldn’t have come here,” she said, her voice warping, splitting into layers that didn’t belong to her. “You shouldn’t have looked.”

I stumbled back, my flashlight flickering wildly as the figure that wasn’t my mother began to dissolve, its shape twisting into something darker, something formless.

And then the voice came again—not hers this time, but mine.

“Daniel…” it whispered, soft and mocking. “You’re already home.”

I woke with a start, gasping for air, the cold metal of the storage unit floor biting into my back. My flashlight lay beside me, its beam weak and sputtering, casting long shadows that seemed to dance across the walls. For a moment, I didn’t move, my chest heaving, my body trembling. The last thing I remembered was—her. That voice. That smile.

But it couldn’t have been real. None of it could’ve been real.

My hand shot to my chest, my fingers curling around the fabric of my uniform as if to anchor myself. The heavy scent of burnt sweetness still lingered, clawing at the back of my throat. I pushed myself upright, the grated floor creaking beneath me. The room was silent now, oppressively so, broken only by the faint hum of the facility’s systems in the distance.

I glanced around, the dim flashlight beam tracing over the storage unit. The shelves were still there, the crates stacked neatly, the metal walls cold and unyielding. Everything was exactly as it had been when I’d first entered.

But something was wrong.

The door I’d entered through was open, but it felt… different. It was too still, too perfect, as if it had been waiting for me to notice it. My eyes darted to the floor, searching for the strange marks I’d seen—the dark streaks, the boot. Nothing. Just smooth, unmarked metal.

I swallowed hard, my throat dry. “No,” I whispered to myself, shaking my head. “It was real. I saw it. I heard her.”

But the more I spoke, the less certain I felt. The memories of what had just happened—the green light, the pulsing walls, her face—were slipping away, unraveling like threads pulled from a frayed rope. The harder I tried to hold onto them, the more they dissolved, leaving only fragments. A shadow here. A whisper there. Her eyes, wide and unnatural, staring into mine.

I grabbed the flashlight and staggered to my feet, my legs weak beneath me. My heart pounded in my chest as I looked around the room again, searching for something—anything—that could prove I wasn’t losing my mind.

“Focus, Vega,” I muttered, my voice shaking. “You’re still here. You’re still… here.”

But where was here? Was I still in the storage unit? Or had I…?

The thought sent a jolt of panic through me. I stumbled toward the open door, gripping the flashlight like it was a lifeline. The hallway beyond was dim, the lights overhead flickering sporadically. I took a hesitant step forward, my boots clanging against the grated floor, and froze.

The sound echoed back at me, distorted, like it had traveled much farther than it should’ve. Too far. My stomach twisted. The corridor looked the same as it always had—cold, sterile, endless—but something about it felt wrong, like it was stretched just slightly beyond the edges of my understanding.

“Hello?” My voice cracked, the word trembling in the air. No response. Not even the faint hum of machinery I’d grown used to.

I took another step, then another, each one feeling heavier than the last. The corridor stretched ahead, impossibly long, the walls curving subtly inward as if guiding me somewhere I didn’t want to go. My flashlight flickered again, the beam growing dimmer, and I smacked it against my palm, cursing under my breath.

As I moved, the whispers started again.

Faint at first, barely audible over the sound of my own breathing. But they grew louder, more distinct, the words slipping through the cracks of my thoughts like smoke.

“Daniel…”

I froze, my breath hitching. The voice was hers again, soft and familiar, wrapping around me like a memory I couldn’t escape.

“Mom?” My voice was barely a whisper, but it echoed down the corridor like a shout.

This time, she didn’t call my name. She laughed. It was a warm, gentle laugh, the kind I remembered from long ago, when she would catch me sneaking cookies from the kitchen or trying to stay up past bedtime. But here, in the silence of the corridor, it sounded wrong. Hollow. Like someone trying to mimic her and failing.

I took a step back, my hands trembling. “You’re not real,” I said, my voice cracking. “You’re not—”

“Why did you leave us, Daniel?” The voice was closer now, cutting me off. It wasn’t just hers anymore. It was layered, fractured, echoing with tones that didn’t belong. “Why didn’t you save me?”

My flashlight sputtered and died, plunging the corridor into darkness. I swore under my breath, fumbling with the switch, but it wouldn’t turn back on. My pulse thundered in my ears as I stood there, frozen in the pitch black.

The whispers grew louder, closing in from all sides. They weren’t just hers anymore—they were mine. My own voice, distorted and mocking, overlapping with hers in a chaotic symphony.

“Why didn’t you save us, Daniel?”

“You left her. You left them. You always leave.”

“No,” I choked out, clutching the dead flashlight like it could protect me. “I didn’t—I didn’t have a choice.”

The laughter came again, sharp and piercing, cutting through the darkness. And then the whispers stopped.

The silence was deafening.

I took a shaky step forward, my hands outstretched, searching for the walls. My fingers brushed against cold metal, but the texture shifted beneath my touch, softening, pulsing. I jerked my hand back, my stomach lurching.

The corridor wasn’t metal anymore. It was alive.

The whispers returned, louder now, filling my mind like a flood. I stumbled backward, tripping over my own feet and falling hard onto the floor. The impact rattled through me, but I barely felt it over the roar of the voices.

“Daniel,” they hissed, all at once. “Come home.”

And then, just as suddenly as it had started, it stopped. The voices, the laughter, the whispers—all gone.

The flashlight flickered back to life in my hand, the beam cutting through the darkness. I was back in the storage unit. The same cold, sterile walls. The same neatly stacked crates. But my heart wouldn’t stop racing, and the faint scent of burnt sweetness still lingered in the air.

I staggered to my feet, gripping the flashlight like it was the only thing tethering me to reality. My knees wobbled, and I leaned against one of the shelves for support, my breath coming in ragged gasps.

I didn’t know what was real anymore.

But I knew one thing: I wasn’t alone in here. And whatever was watching me, whatever was waiting, wasn’t done with me yet.

I leaned against the cold metal shelf, gripping it so tightly my knuckles went white. My flashlight’s beam wavered over the walls, shaking with the tremor in my hands. I tried to tell myself it was over, that I was just exhausted, that the whispers and the shadowy things were some trick of stress and adrenaline. But I didn’t believe it. Not for a second.

The room felt alive—watching, breathing, waiting. The air was heavy, suffocating, and that burnt-sweet smell was stronger now, clawing its way into my lungs. Every fiber of my being screamed at me to get out, but I couldn’t move. Not yet. Not when my thoughts were boiling over, flooding my mind with guilt I didn’t ask for.

“It’s not my fault,” I whispered hoarsely, the words tasting bitter on my tongue. “I didn’t have a choice. I didn’t—I couldn’t save her.”

The sound of my own voice was small and fragile, swallowed by the room’s oppressive silence. My chest heaved as I tried to catch my breath, the memories clawing their way to the surface. The hospital room, the sterile white walls, the machines hooked up to her frail, unrecognizable body. The way she’d looked at me in those final days—not with anger, not with blame, but with sadness. Like she knew I’d failed her.

“I tried,” I said, louder now, as if the walls themselves needed to hear me. “I tried, but there was nothing I could do! What was I supposed to do, huh? Magic money out of thin air? Cure her myself?”

The words echoed back at me, hollow and cruel. I clenched my fists, my nails digging into my palms as the anger surged, hot and bitter. “It wasn’t my fault,” I said again, spitting the words like venom. “I had to take the job. I had to. She’s gone, and it’s not my—”

A sound cut through the silence, sharp and grating. I froze, the anger draining from me in an instant. It started as a soft scraping, like nails dragging across metal, but it grew louder, closer, more deliberate.

It was coming from the far corner of the storage unit.

The beam of my flashlight trembled as I swung it toward the sound. The crates at the far end seemed to shift under the light, their edges blurring, distorting. The scraping stopped, replaced by a low, wet slithering noise that made my stomach turn.

My breath caught as something moved—a shadow, impossibly large, sliding across the floor. It stretched and twisted like smoke, its edges flickering in and out of existence, but it had weight. I could hear it dragging itself toward me, the floor creaking under its presence.

“No,” I whispered, taking a step back. My legs felt like jelly, my heart hammering against my ribs. “No, this isn’t real. This isn’t—”

The shadow stopped. For a moment, everything was still, the air so thick it felt like I was breathing through a straw.

And then it rose.

The shadow began to stretch upward, unraveling into a towering, amorphous shape that scraped the ceiling. Tendrils of darkness spilled out from its edges, writhing and twitching like they were alive. The flashlight flickered violently as the thing took shape, its form coalescing into something almost human—a long, twisted torso with too many arms, its face an empty void that seemed to drink in the light.

I stumbled backward, my back hitting the shelves. My flashlight slipped from my grasp, clattering to the floor and spinning wildly, casting distorted shadows that only made the thing look worse.

The void where its face should’ve been tilted toward me, and then it spoke.

“Daniel…” The voice was hers again—my mother’s. But it wasn’t her. It was layered, warped, a grotesque mockery of the voice I’d loved. “You left me. You always leave.”

“No,” I choked out, shaking my head violently. “No, I didn’t—I didn’t leave you! There was nothing I could do!”

The thing moved closer, its many arms reaching out, the tendrils dragging along the floor with a sick, wet sound.

“You could have tried harder,” it hissed, its voice shifting, breaking apart into a dozen others. Some of them were familiar—hers, mine, others I couldn’t place—but they all spoke with the same venomous certainty. “You didn’t care enough.”

“I did!” I shouted, my voice cracking. “I cared! I did everything I could! Don’t you think I wanted to save her? Don’t you think I would’ve given anything—everything—to make it stop?”

The thing stopped just short of me, its many arms trembling, twisting into shapes I couldn’t understand. Its void-like face leaned closer, so close I could feel the cold radiating off of it.

“Then why,” it whispered, its voice soft and deadly, “are you here, and she’s not?”

I couldn’t answer. The words lodged in my throat, choking me, as the guilt I’d buried for so long rose like bile. My knees buckled, and I sank to the floor, trembling.

“I didn’t mean to…” I whispered, tears burning in my eyes. “I didn’t mean to leave her…”

The thing leaned closer still, its void-face inches from mine. Its many arms reached out, brushing against my shoulders, my face, my chest. The touch was cold, invasive, like it was peeling away layers of me, searching for something I didn’t want to give.

“You belong to me now,” it said, the voices blending into a single, inhuman tone. “You’ll never leave.”

The tendrils wrapped around me, pulling me closer, tighter, suffocating me in their icy grip. My vision blurred as the green light I thought I’d left behind seeped into the edges of my sight, pulsing, twisting, dragging me down into the dark.

And then I screamed.

The tendrils tightened around me, dragging me deeper into the cold, suffocating dark. My scream echoed and then vanished, swallowed by the void as the thing’s many voices murmured and hissed in my ears. I felt myself unraveling, piece by piece—my thoughts scattering, my memories slipping through my fingers like sand. The walls of the world fell away, and for a moment, there was nothing but the pulsing green light, rhythmic and alive, beating like a heart.

I thought it was over. I wanted it to be over.

But then I woke up.

The first thing I felt was the floor—cold, smooth, vibrating faintly under my hands. Not the grated metal of the storage unit, but something else entirely. My breath came in shallow gasps as I opened my eyes, squinting against the harsh green light that filled the space around me.

I was lying on my back in a vast, cavernous chamber, the ceiling so high it disappeared into the glow. The walls were alive with movement—writhing tendrils and vein-like structures pulsing with that same sickly green light. They twisted and coiled, merging and splitting, shifting like they were breathing. The air was thick and heavy, charged with an electric hum that thrummed through my chest like a second heartbeat.

I sat up slowly, my body aching, my mind reeling. The chamber stretched endlessly in all directions, its floor a seamless expanse of dark, glassy material that reflected the faint glow above. In the center of it all was a tear, a rift.

It wasn’t just a crack in the fabric of reality, like I’d imagined from the containment protocols. It was massive—a towering, pulsating mass of light and shadow, twisting and churning in impossible patterns. Tendrils of green energy snaked outward from its core, coiling into the walls, the floor, the very air itself. Looking at it made my stomach churn, my vision blur, as if my mind couldn’t fully grasp what I was seeing.

I scrambled backward, my palms slipping on the smooth floor, but no matter how far I moved, the rift loomed over me, pulling at me with an invisible force. Its presence was overwhelming, suffocating, like it was pressing into every corner of my mind, whispering things I couldn’t understand.

“This… this can’t be real,” I muttered, my voice shaking. But even as I said it, I knew it was. The burnt-sweet smell was back, stronger than ever, clinging to my skin and filling my lungs. My body trembled as the rift pulsed again, the green light flaring brighter, casting long, twisting shadows across the chamber.

A sound echoed through the space—a low, resonant groan that seemed to come from the rift itself. It wasn’t just a noise; it was a presence, a weight that pressed down on me, threatening to crush me where I sat. The air vibrated with its power, and I felt it in my bones, in my teeth, in my thoughts.

“Daniel…”

The voice came again, but this time it wasn’t a whisper. It was a roar, layered and fragmented, shaking the chamber and rattling my skull. It came from everywhere and nowhere, filling the space like it had always been there, waiting for me.

I clamped my hands over my ears, but it didn’t help. The voice wasn’t just in the air—it was inside me, burrowing into my mind, pulling at the fragile pieces of my sanity.

“You’ve always belonged here,” it said, the words vibrating through me. “You’ve always been mine.”

“No!” I shouted, my voice breaking. “I don’t belong to you! I—I didn’t ask for this!”

The rift pulsed again, and the light dimmed for a moment, casting the chamber into an eerie half-darkness. Shadows moved along the walls, twisting into shapes I couldn’t understand—faces, hands, fragments of things that shouldn’t exist. They reached toward me, their forms flickering and dissolving like smoke, but I could feel their presence, their hunger.

“You left her,” the voice said, shifting, warping. “You left everyone. And now you’re here.”

“I didn’t leave her!” I screamed, my voice raw. “I didn’t—I didn’t mean to…”

The rift flared violently, the green light washing over me, burning into my eyes. My memories surged forward, unbidden—my mother in the hospital bed, her hand weak and trembling in mine. The last conversation I’d had with her, the way I’d promised to do better, to fix things, to come back.

And then I’d left.

I pressed my hands to my temples, shaking my head, trying to block out the memories, the light, the voice. “It wasn’t my fault,” I whispered, the words crumbling in my throat. “It wasn’t my fault…”

The rift seemed to laugh, its energy rippling through the chamber like a wave. The tendrils around me began to shift, moving closer, curling inward. One of them stretched toward me, stopping just short of my chest. It hovered there, pulsing faintly, as if waiting for me to acknowledge it.

And then it spoke—not in words, but in images. Memories.

I saw myself, younger, sitting at my mother’s bedside, my head bowed, her voice faint but kind as she told me it wasn’t my fault, that I’d done all I could. But the memory shifted, twisting. Her face blurred, her voice warping into something darker. “You let me go,” she said, her voice cold and sharp. “You left me alone.”

“No,” I whispered, tears burning in my eyes. “No, that’s not—”

The tendril lashed out, wrapping around my wrist. Its touch was cold and invasive, like it was sinking into me, pulling at the edges of my thoughts. I screamed, trying to wrench my arm free, but the tendril held firm, its grip tightening.

“You are mine,” the rift roared, its voice shaking the chamber. “You’ve always been mine.”

The green light flared again, blinding me, and I felt myself falling—falling into the rift, into the endless, hungry void.

And then, everything went still.

When I opened my eyes, I was standing. The chamber was gone, replaced by the sterile, flickering lights of the facility corridor. My flashlight was in my hand again, its beam steady, cutting through the dimness. The air was cold and metallic, the burnt-sweet smell a faint memory.

I looked around, my heart hammering in my chest. The corridor was empty, silent, as if nothing had happened. But as I turned, my eyes caught on the reflective surface of a control panel, and my breath froze in my throat.

The face staring back at me wasn’t mine.

Not entirely.

“Daniel…. Thank you.”
BREAKING NEWS: Ashen Blade Industries Unveils Revolutionary Product Amid Tragedy

January 7, 2025 — By Catherine Hayes, Associated Press

Ashen Blade Industries, the global leader in advanced energy solutions and defense technologies, announced today the launch of their latest product, the PulseCore Reactor. Touted as a groundbreaking leap in sustainable energy, the reactor promises to revolutionize the industry with its unparalleled efficiency and near-limitless output.

The unveiling comes amid heightened public interest in Ashen Blade’s activities, though the company has remained characteristically tight-lipped about the specifics of the reactor’s development. CEO Marcus Feldman called the project “a triumph of innovation and dedication” during a press conference earlier this morning.

“This is the culmination of years of tireless work by the brilliant minds at Ashen Blade,” Feldman stated. “The PulseCore Reactor will redefine the future of energy, ushering in an era of unprecedented progress.”

However, the celebratory mood surrounding the announcement has been tempered by a dark and disturbing development involving one of the company’s employees.

Employee Linked to Shocking Killing Spree

Authorities have issued an urgent manhunt for Daniel Vega, a junior logistics officer at Ashen Blade Industries, who is suspected of committing a series of brutal murders over the past week. Vega, 29, was last seen at the company’s remote containment facility in the northern sector, where he had been assigned routine inventory work.

Since then, Vega has been implicated in the deaths of at least nine individuals, including coworkers and security personnel. Investigators describe the killings as “unimaginably violent,” with evidence suggesting a deliberate and methodical approach. Many of the victims were reportedly found with severe injuries, though details remain scarce as the investigation continues.

Chief Investigator Sarah Morton addressed the media late last night, describing Vega as “highly dangerous” and warning the public to remain vigilant.

“Daniel Vega is still at large,” Morton stated. “He should not be approached under any circumstances. If you see him, contact law enforcement immediately.”

Questions Surround Ashen Blade’s Role

Ashen Blade Industries has yet to issue an official statement regarding Vega’s actions or how he was able to evade detection for so long. Some reports suggest Vega may have been suffering from acute psychological distress in the days leading up to the murders, though the company has refused to confirm these claims.

When asked about the incidents during this morning’s press conference, CEO Marcus Feldman offered a brief response.

“This is a tragedy for everyone involved,” Feldman said. “We are cooperating fully with law enforcement and will continue to provide our utmost support during this investigation.”

A Frightening Unknown

Despite the company’s assurances, questions remain about Vega’s motives and the exact circumstances leading up to the killings. Those who knew him describe Vega as quiet and unassuming, with no prior history of violence.

“He wasn’t the kind of guy you’d expect this from,” one coworker, speaking anonymously, told reporters. “I don’t understand it. None of us do.”

As the manhunt continues, speculation about Vega’s whereabouts grows. Some believe he’s still hiding within the sprawling containment facility, while others suggest he may have fled into the nearby wilderness.

For now, one thing is certain: Daniel Vega, once an ordinary logistics officer, is now one of the most wanted men in the country. And the chilling mystery of what happened inside that facility—and why—remains unanswered.

Is it normal for my hands/fingers to tremble a tiny bit, more noticeable when doing precision things with tweezers etc? It isn't a major tremor but it is visible if I stare at my fingers when holding them out or when holding a certain position with a finger.  I would say its about 0.7mm from max to min at its worst (the fingers themselves), which is kinda rare but i can see it, as mentioned,  when holding tweezers/soldering iron/anything that adds length to my fingers/etc. It might be less, it's hard to measure it, so I'm overestimating. Maybe 1-2mm max when I haven't eaten or have drunk a lot of coffee.

Even then, it's not a big tremor or any of the common tremors very minuscule but enough to garner my attention at those times. 



Is this a physiological tremor?



The reason im worried is because the field i am studying to go into requires a high amount of precision work on the level of microsurgery (but not surgery) and even a slight, abnormal tremor could impact me if its not a stress/nerves tremor and has a medical cause that cant be removed from practice/de-stressing/eating etc. I cant tell if it is a nerves only tremor however, which is why I'm asking

It took me about 7 hours because of the level of frat house dirt that I encountered (it was not a frat house but I don’t think the tenant touched any of the cleaning supplies). Most of the furniture was rattan, and there wasn’t much clutter since I was prepping for a new tenant. I’m curious what you would charge a homeowner for the following:
Dusting both bedrooms and living room
Wiping down surfaces with gunk on them in bedroom and living room
Cleaning a leather sofa, vacuuming in between the cushions
Scrubbing the baseboards - gunky dust
Scrubbing the kitchen cabinets (inside and out, food dripping down white cabinets onto the floor), wiping down the island where the trash can was (must’ve used the trashcan as a basketball hoop with the wall as the back)
Cleaning out the coffee pot, toaster, toaster oven, microwave
Wiping down the fridge that had an exploded soda splatter everywhere
We will just leave the bathrooms (a tub in one and tiled shower with glass doors and chrome frame in the other) as DEEP CLEANED … you know… frat house
Vacuumed rugs, tiled floors and mopped tiles
Cleaned glass dining room table.. 
Laundered linens
Made beds
Emptying dishwasher
Taking out the trash

I’m sure there are other things that I can’t remember. I may be slow, but I’m not THAT slow. I feel as though I was way underpaid for the area I cleaned in. Condo in a golf course community in south Florida. ",2,1736364054.0,housekeeping,3,1.0,False

I'm looking at purchasing a good coffee machine + grinder. About a year ago I couldn't stand the taste of espresso pods anymore and moved to buying coffee from a roaster/cafe near my house. Their coffee is the best I've ever had (and consistently too) but I want to save on the $11 a day on coffee (partner and myself) and also the convenience of not leaving the house for a takeaway coffee.

I have a friend who's a machine repair technician and he insists I stay away from Breville/anything you can buy at the shops from his experience of preparing machines.

He recommends the Rancilio Silvia V6 and Varia VS3 which Alternate Brewing sell as a bundle for $1700 AUD. Is this worth it? Ideally I would've liked the idea of around $1K to spend, but I can always extend my budget if the product is worth the extra spend.

Hoping to get some insights on this? Is that a good bundle? Is there something better? Can you get an all in one that's not a breville/store product for less than $2K?

I was passing through your region on a road trip over the holidays and my family and I ate lunch in Seneca Falls at Cafe 19. It was delicious, the atmosphere was great, the coffee drinks (the Suzy Bee in honor of Susan B. Anthony, in particular) were perfect. 

The WALL ART was spectacular. There was a QR code on the tabletop napkin holder that said it would direct me to info about the wall art, Warhol-like pop art portraits of the major women's rights leaders. The code didn't work for me, and in the hustle and bustle of getting our three kids out the door and back on the road, I forgot to ask anyone who works there about the link.

I know it's a long shot, but I'd love a link to learn more about the pop art prints and possibly buy them, if that's an option. I loved the young Elizabeth Cady Stanton portrait in particular, and the ones of Alice Paul and Carrie Chapman Catt (I think?) along the wall near the door. If purchasing the files or posters or small prints is an option, I'd put them on my home office wall! Can anybody direct me to the right place? A google search turned up nothing, and the Cafe 19 website doesn't link to the art, just mentions it. Also I sent Cafe 19 a message on IG but no reply yet.

Every morning, I force myself to get up at 6:30, make breakfast for Tommy, and try to keep our lives as normal as possible. But it's hard. So hard.  
  
The house feels different now. Empty. Silent. Sometimes I catch myself staring at her coffee mug, still sitting in the kitchen cabinet where she left it. I haven't touched it. I can't.  
  
Tommy, my five-year-old, he's been... surprisingly strong through all this. Too strong, maybe. When Sarah left, he didn't cry. Not once. Which is strange, considering how close they were. He just keeps smiling, playing with his toys, as if nothing has changed.  
  
The first few weeks were the worst. I couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I'd see her face. Her expression in those final moments... No. I can't think about that. I need to stay strong for Tommy.  
  
Lately, though, something's been off. I'm constantly exhausted, but it's more than just emotional fatigue. There's this... heaviness. It started in my head, like a fog that wouldn't lift. Then my shoulders began to ache, as if carrying an invisible burden.  
  
I've been taking sleeping pills, but they don't help much. Sometimes, in the corner of my eye, I catch glimpses of something. A shadow. A silhouette. But when I turn, there's nothing there. Just empty rooms and silent walls.  
  
The worst part? The garden. I used to love gardening with Sarah. Now I can't even look at it. The soil seems... different. Darker. The roses she planted are growing wild, their thorns sharper than ever. They're blooming blood red this year.  
  
Tommy still goes out there to play sometimes. Yesterday, I saw him talking to himself near the rose bushes. When I asked him who he was talking to, he just smiled and said, ""Mommy's flowers are pretty this year, aren't they, Daddy?""  
  
I had to turn away. I couldn't let him see my face.      The exhaustion is getting worse. At work, I can barely focus. My colleagues keep asking if I'm okay - I must look terrible. I tell them I'm just having trouble sleeping, still adjusting to being a single parent. They nod sympathetically, probably thinking Sarah left me for another man.  
  
If only they knew... No. Stop. I can't think like that.  
  
The weight on my shoulders has become almost unbearable. Sometimes I find myself hunched over, as if something's pressing down on me. The doctor says it's stress, prescribed me some pills. But pills can't fix this. They can't fix what I... what happened.  
  
Last night was particularly bad. I was washing dishes when I caught a reflection in the kitchen window. For a split second, I thought I saw Sarah standing behind me. When I turned around, there was nothing there. But the air felt heavy, thick with the scent of her perfume - that sweet, floral scent she always wore. The same scent that still lingers in the garden soil.  
  
Tommy's behavior is starting to unnerve me. He's always been a happy child, but this is different. He hums to himself while playing, the same lullaby Sarah used to sing. Sometimes I hear him laughing and talking in his room late at night. When I check on him, he's always alone, but his toys are arranged in a perfect circle, as if he's been having a tea party.  
  
This morning, he asked me something strange over breakfast.  
  
""Daddy, why do you look so tired? Is it because you're carrying Mommy?""  
  
I nearly choked on my coffee. ""What do you mean, buddy?""  
  
He just smiled and went back to his cereal, humming that damn lullaby again.  
  
The roses in the garden are growing faster than they should. Their roots must be reaching deep, feeding on... No. I need to stop. I need to focus on keeping it together. For Tommy.  
  
But this weight... God, this weight...  Today, everything fell apart. Literally.  
  
I was standing in the kitchen, trying to make dinner, when the room started spinning. The weight on my shoulders had become crushing, like someone was hanging onto my back. My knees buckled. The last thing I heard before hitting the floor was the sound of small footsteps running down the hallway.  
  
""Daddy? Daddy, wake up!""  
  
Tommy's voice pulled me back to consciousness. I was lying face-down on the kitchen floor, the cold tiles pressing against my cheek. As I struggled to push myself up, my shoulders screamed in protest. It felt like my spine was being compressed by an invisible force.  
  
I managed to get to my knees, coming face to face with Tommy. His expression wasn't scared or worried - he looked almost... amused? The kitchen lights flickered above us, casting strange shadows on his small face.  
  
""Tommy,"" I wheezed, the pressure on my back making it hard to speak, ""don't you ever feel lonely? Now that... now that Mommy's gone?""  
  
He tilted his head, looking at me with those innocent eyes - Sarah's eyes. Then he smiled, that sweet, childish smile that usually warmed my heart. But this time, it sent a chill down my spine.  
  
""But Daddy,"" he said, his voice light and cheerful, ""Mommy never left. She's always with us.""  
  
My throat went dry. ""What do you mean, buddy?""  
  
Tommy giggled - that same giggle he used to share with Sarah during their private jokes. ""Silly Daddy. Mommy rides on your back every day. That's why you're so tired!""  
  
The room started spinning again, but this time it wasn't from exhaustion. The weight on my shoulders suddenly felt different - more defined, more... human. I could feel something pressing against my back, arms wrapped around my neck, legs gripping my waist.  
  
Something wet dripped onto my shoulder. When I touched it, my fingers came away red.  
  
Tommy was still smiling, still humming that lullaby. ""Mommy says the roses need more water, Daddy. She says they're growing really well where you planted her.""  
  
I can feel her now, even as I write this. Her weight on my back, her cold arms around my neck. Tommy is in his room, having a tea party. I can hear him talking to someone, laughing.  
  
The roses are blooming beautifully this year. Blood red and thorny, feeding on what lies beneath.  
  
And Sarah... Sarah never left.  
  
She's still here.  
  
Still watching.

Yesterday I spilled some coffee on it and immediately attempted to clean it. I soaked all I could up with a towel, then treated what I could with Folex. It left a stain. I wasn't overly concerned, because I'd seen other people with much tougher stains have it professionally cleaned and it come out. Well, they just left and they couldn't get the stain to budge. 

I know polyester is better for stains than Nylon, but it kind of blows my mind that I'd have such a stain so early in this carpets life cycle. The carpet cleaner was surprised given how new the carpet was and how fast we reacted to cleaning it that he didn't get it out. He said normally he doesn't even have to treat it, just a regular cleaning will get it out, but he tried treating it twice with an oxidizing cleaner and it didn't move.

I signed my lease to one of their properties, Berrytree Apartments, back in February and moved in August. They completely failed to mention that throughout the months of October and November there would be a full scale in-unit renovation. About $2000 worth of personal belongings were then stolen in the middle of November, and the only people with access to my studio apartment was the entire maintenance team. Somewhat doubt it was the maintenance team, but I do believe the language barrier led to maintenance letting somebody in my apartment without fully understanding who the owner was. Aside from maintenance, the only other people that have been to my apartment are close friends from high school whom I have full trust in. Only family and 6 close friends have been to my place, and would not benefit from the items stolen since they already have all of them (game consoles, winter jacket, backpack, shoes, etc). Police intervention did nothing since the property conveniently has zero surveillance, and in order for personal cameras to work you need to buy an entirely separate router. Property managers gave me the run around for over a month and communicated poorly, and ultimately ended with National General Insurance telling me to kick rocks. I since then have bought a separate renters insurance for theft/personal belongings. While this is already enough to rightfully infuriate anybody, there are a number of other inconveniences spanning from 48 hour Internet outages (with zero transparency) to water leaks.

Today I reached my limit when they shut my Internet off 10 minutes into my workday (I work as an accounting assistant from home 9-5). For context, this issue stemmed from a monthly rent payment. I connected with an employee yesterday to explain that my new credit card has not showed up in the mail yet, and I want to pay rent in order to take advantage of the points I could get after spending a certain amount in 3 months. I have never been late with a rent payment, and the employee took note of this and even waived my late fee since it was my first offense. Now today, 10 mins into my workday with zero heads up they shut my Internet. Bit the bullet and paid straight from my checking account since I was told the Internet would be turned back on instantly after payment. Called a half hour after paying saying ""I paid this a half an hour ago, since you still didn't turn my shit on I need to go work from a coffee shop, can you call me when it's back on?"" To which the manager said ""I thought you were going to pay by check, I don't appreciate you cussing me out"" and then hung up the phone.

While the other inconveniences are trivial compared to the theft situation that took place, I have found it very hard to find a legal representative in this matter. Since I Graduated less than a month ago, I cannot get help from ASMSU, and every phone number I reach out to either is a scam, can't help me in general, or wants me to pay a fee before talking to anybody. I would really like to find out if I have any case to end my lease early and get out of here. If anybody here has pursued legal action in a similar case, I would highly appreciate you reaching out to me and providing some resources.

TLDR: DTN as a whole is a horrible company with no morals or respect for their renters, somebody please comment some legal resources I could consult with in order to end my lease early.",2,1736362933.0,msu,0,1.0,False

Thought it was the shit. Been loving it. Got a Breville Barista cause I'm the type that will go deep and figure this shit out. I have not been able to get it right yet. Here's where I'm at:

* Single Wall Double Shot Filter
* 18 grams of yield
* I am using a distribution tool (WDT I believe)
* I am cleaning the edges of any grinds to avoid the seal being broken
* I am using it on manual mode. Aiming for about 5-8 seconds of pre-infusion, 22-28 seconds of extraction, and about 36-40 grams of yield.
* Grind Setting is currently at a 5.
* I let the machine preheat for at least 10, usually 20, minutes.
* I usually run the machine once beforehand to make sure cup and whatnot is heated and cleared.
* Using [Feast Pine and Gold blend:](https://www.feastcoffee.com/products/pine-gold)

* I used a leveler to make sure my machine was level too avoid channeling / poor flow.
* Using filtered water.

Coffee always tastes too sour or too bitter. I can't get that fruity sweetness I love so much about espresso when it's nailed just right.

What I'm finding, right now, is that the pre-infusion is taking 10+ seconds. I thought my grind may be too course in that case, so I made the grind a bit finer. Now, the pre-infusion is still 10+ seconds, but the extraction is going too slow (not getting that steady stream of golden honey flow, but dribbles).

My conclusion here is that I may be tamping too hard? When I dump the puck, it stays a solid puck in the garbage can. Quite compact.

I don't know why, since I've dealt with temperatures much lower in the past, but for some reason I just had the worst night. I think maybe my sleeping bag has become too worn out and doesn't insulate as well, or it could be that I've lost so much weight over the past year. But I also didn't remember to eat more for body heat - which for me is the main thing that makes me warm. I have such a huge difference when I can have a real meal - which is almost never. Yesterday it was just a bag of Walmart chips with a $1 can of enchilada sauce. Today it is 2 cans of .98 Walmart sardines and some bread. I couldn't take it anymore since I was shivering at 4:30am and got up only to realize I had a sore throat and was coming down with a cold - or maybe some other more severe respiratory infection. And that brutal north wind just hasn't let up all day here either. This is the first real major cold weather this year and even though I've been through many years of them - I feel like my ability to continue to deal with them is getting less and less.

Standing there in the Walmart next to the sardines was all the soup - and wow did I feel like a nice steaming hot bowl of soup. Instead cold sardines again. At least I had hot coffee this morning at Panera. But that place has been like a hospital ward for the last couple of weeks and that is no doubt where I caught whatever I have now.  People are gross. There was a guy there this morning obviously sick as hell coughing up a lung and sneezing, blowing his nose then going straight to the coffee and touching everything that everyone else touches. No wonder these viruses spread like wildfire. Anyway - be safe out there and stay away from the sick people.

Meanwhile, Thailand’s own Bitcoin fam is living the dream in Kalasin’s Huay Phueng district (aka Bitcoin Town) where locals are slurping noodles and catching tuk-tuks using Satoshis. A crypto genius even opened a coffee shop here to give the curious a taste of crypto freedom ☕✨.

1. **Embrace Your Single Season** Being single is an opportunity to focus on yourself, your passions, and your growth. This is your time to bloom and become the best version of yourself—for *you*.
2. **Stop Comparing Your Journey** Everyone’s love story unfolds differently. Just because someone else found love at 25 doesn’t mean you’ve missed your chance. Your story will be unique, and that’s beautiful.
3. **Put Yourself in New Environments** Shake things up! Join a hobby group, take a class, or try a new coffee shop. Expanding your world can introduce you to like-minded people.
4. **Work on Your Confidence Daily** Confidence is magnetic. Write down three things you love about yourself every day. There are apps that can help you do this! When you feel good about who you are, it shows—and attracts others.
5. **Curate a Positive Inner Circle** Surround yourself with friends and people who uplift you and remind you of your worth. Their encouragement can help keep loneliness at bay.
6. **Practice Gratitude for Your Current Life** It’s easy to focus on what you lack, but shift your energy by listing what you *do* have—health, friends, career, or even the freedom to create your dream life.
7. **Learn From Past Relationships Without Dwelling** Reflect on lessons, but don’t let past hurt define your future. Use the wisdom you’ve gained to make your next connection healthier and stronger.

I'm using a DeLonghi ECP3420 with a K2 grinder. I started getting a feel for the machine by using the pressurized baskets and a standard medium roast consumer blend, and have now moved on to an unpressurized naked portafilter. I had good results with the blend and thought I'd move on to some of my favorite single-origin beans. This afternoon I tried a nice Sumatra from a local roaster. In a pour-over I'm getting the ripe dark cherry with hazelnut and chocolate undertones and a nice soft, round mouth feel I'd expect from these beans, but I'm getting some odd results with an espresso. I could use some help knowing what to look for as I try to dial it in. I heat the portafilter and group head by running two blank shots first, allowing the water to come to temperature each time. I'm using filter paper at the bottom with a screen on top, and there doesn't seem to be any channeling. The shot is pulling quite long (38s for 1:2), but the fruit tastes green and a bit more acidic than I'd expect from these beans, suggesting it's under-extracted. I'm getting the hazelnut and chocolate as it cools, but it's still quite puckery and sharp, not at all soft like I had imagined. If I go finer, that will lengthen the shot time, which seems wrong.

There's places where food is sitting on the counter for several minutes before the couriers get there. Most restaurants don't even place pickup orders on a heated surface. So, it's unfair to blame the driver.

Given these circumstances, do you really think piping hot food is possible 100% of the times? I understand it's do-able for short distances, but realistically, long distances and hot food do not mix well.

I struggle to understand people throwing tantrums because their delivered food, that was sitting inside of a car for minutes and inside packaging that affects the freshness of it, didn't arrive piping hot. Like, wow! Who could have predicted that?! /s

You have a microwave, a stove, an oven. You can heat up your food like a grown adult. It's not like cold food isn't fixable. Drive yourself there and order it in person if you want hot food that retains its quality.

If you order loaded fries or nachos for delivery from a place 20+ minutes away and then complain about it being soggy and cold, that's on you. Same with coffee, drinks, and ice cream. OF COURSE the ice cream will probably arrive a bit melted, especially if it's summer.

anyway, i’m calling it shadowdb—because we all love edgy names—and my plan is to make it AES-256-GCM-based, python-based, docker-based, probably coffee-based, etc. the kicker: absolutely no code changes required in your app. you just swap the port & host, and everything’s magically encrypted/decrypted. no sweaty library dependencies. no rewriting queries. just a teeny bit of “where do i put my 32-byte key so the sysadmin doesn’t find it?” existential anxiety.

but before i go down this rabbit hole of side projects and questionable maintainability, i’d like to gauge interest. are you in the market for a frictionless encryption approach to your postgres traffic? do you see value in it, or do you prefer your data in plain text because danger = fun?

my plan includes:

- a docker-compose setup so your cat can deploy it
- an optional config for advanced paranoid tinkering
- open source under AGPL, so you can fork it, fix it, or rename it to spookdb
- eventually maybe mysql support, because i guess it exists

would you actually use something like this, or is this a big “meh”? i’m open to suggestions, name-calling, or even “you should just do x instead.” let me know before i commit to yet another abandoned github repository.

Yesterday, I swallowed my pride, rewatched the show and the second season and realized that it's not half bad. 

The first season has alot of moments that made me roll my eyes, and I started to feel like I was back in Middle School in the worst ways. I hated Kaneki for being such a weak protagonist, I hated the character designs because so many looked like teenagers walking out of a hot topic for the first time, I felt like the doves were weirdly ineffiecient despite being the only resistance to Ghouls.Worst of all, it's just so preachy. I get it, Touka feels bad she can't eat her friend's cooking, the manager is trying to turn over a new leaf, Hinami lost her parents because they just so happen to be a different species. Wah wah wah. 

Season 2 was a marked improvement across the board. Kaneki both grew a spine and fucked off so the show could finally focus on the other characters, who I thought weren't getting enough face time. The CCG basically took over the narrative which I'll get into in the next paragraph, and the writing finally stopped banging on the ""Ghouls are people too"" bell and let the story just play out. It was a rough 13 episodes, but the reason they were so bleh was because you need to be eased into the story. If you can't accept the premise, you won't survive.

It took me years to realize, but you aren't supposed to be rooting against the humans. Kaneki is an unfortunate soul because he got dragged into a world he wasn't prepared for kicking and screaming but that doesn't make him the defacto good guy. People have valid reasons to oppose Ghouls, and the Ghouls in turn have valid reasons to believe they're the victims, and in a lot of cases they are. The CCG took over the plot because there really isn't much of a story you can tell without them, the Akatsuki is a threat to people in both worlds and they need to be stopped. Whose going to stop them? The coffee shop crew? 

Although I will stand by one belief that I have: The author went a little too far on making the Ghouls inhuman. Because I do feel for them but there's really just no way they can peacefully coexist when they can't even eat anything besides human flesh. Aside from that though I like Tokyo Ghoul now.

The problem is he is an apartment dog, yet he wants to go potty constantly. I only give him water in the morning and afternoon with his food to help prevent potty accidents but if he’s left alone for even a second, he will try to go. Living in an apartment and on the second floor makes this a huge hassle, having to put his harness on, get dressed for the winter, and wait for him to go while its 2 degrees out like 8 times a day + the carpet damage. I also know that frequent potty trips are a puppy trait that he will soon grow out of but I want to start teaching at a young age.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. 

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. 

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. 

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. 

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. 

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. 

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. 

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. 

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. 

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. 

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. 



• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. 

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

1hwrcl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/generativeAI/comments/1hwrcl4/i_published_an_altrock_album_generated_with_suno/,"I published an alt-rock album generated with suno, managed to get very consistent results across tracks (learnings and links inside!)","I have been using Suno for months, but as soon as I tried their new model (v4) I realized that it had the potential to create great, complete songs.

Over the last couple of weeks I put together 9 songs in a specific style I like, designing them as if they were produced by a real band. I paid a lot of attention to keep consistency in the vocals.

Each song cost me a coffee for the creativity boost, a dollar for the AI model credits, and an hour of work to draft lyrics, refine them with AI or manually, generate multiple versions, select the best one, polish it, and manually master the final track.

**You may listen to them** [**on Spotify**](https://open.spotify.com/album/1uvp7yDrgS1S9AV6HquElz) **or** [**on YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gguilGjt6JY&list=OLAK5uy_kJVHa0Ny5M6HtMEFvvMd8SQe93TnuvoXs)

What I learned (and where tools can improve):

1. **Consistency Across Songs**: Maintaining a cohesive style across tracks is challenging. The tool doesn’t allow band name or style references, and features like ""personas"" and ""covers"" aren’t fully effective. However, if you write a very detailed style prompt, the model will generate songs in a small set of styles, some of which will have similar vocals.
2. **Iterative Song Creation**: Generating a great song in one go is rare. The best approach is to generate several attempts and pick the one that starts the most promising way, then extend and refine iteratively. There are complexities around getting the right timestamp to extend from, and sometimes including the current word/sentence of the lyrics vs. including only the lyrics for the rest of the song. The model may cut a word or repeat a sentence sometimes.
3. **Remastering**: The ""remaster"" feature can fix overly saturated tracks, but it occasionally alters lyrics or vocals in unexpected ways.
4. **Length and Noise**: The longer the song, the noisier it gets. For instance, every iteration of the chorus gets noisier, with more artifacts in the vocals and more layers of melody that get too fuzzy. You may be able to fix this by ""remastering"" afterwards, or may have to resort to manual compositing during post processing.
5. **Replacing a Section**: The ""replace section"" feature works reasonably, but sometimes it's really hard to select the right area and listen to it. The area to regenerate must be >10s (would be cool if that wasn't a requirement), and the generated snippet sometimes doesn't sound quite similar to the rest of the track, so sometimes requires applying a ""remaster"" afterwards.
6. **Stems**: The ""get stems"" feature generates stems that don't add up to the original track and often sound worse when combined.
7. **Autotune**: The model frequently produces vocals with the autotune effect. This probably comes from the training set, but sometimes is undesired and defining ""autotune"" as an excluded style doesn't really help, so sometimes you must just regenerate and hope for the best.
8. **Lyric Generation**: The ""ReMi"" lyric generation model is quite creative and fun to work with.

I hope this is useful to somebody!

[$700]","We've had our Delonghi Stilosa for just over a year, and in that time have used it every day for cappuccinos for 2. We purchased the Stilosa as a basic machine because we weren't sure we would use it much. Now that we have demonstrated that we will, we are ready to either:

* Upgrade to a better machine, or
* Do more mods/upgrades to the Stilosa

We use the following items/mods with the Stilosa:

* Took off the plastic steam wand cover and zip-tied the rubber part securely according to [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJDmF3zl0ug&t=40s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJDmF3zl0ug&t=40s)
* Bottomless portafilter with puck screen
* Separate grinder where we grind fresh beans that we get on delivery from local coffee roaster
* Needle distribution tool, apex stone distributor, and press

We're happy with the Stilosa results. I am mostly annoyed at the time it takes to steam the milk for 2 cappuccinos. It takes 4 heating cycles on the steamer with waiting in between. Overall when we make our coffee it's a 15 minute time investment. I'd love to get this down to 5-10 min for our 2 drinks.

Now, I still remember what I did yesterday and what conflicts I had with my friends and I never forget the people I have met. My memory did a 180. 

Over the years I learned a lot about what affects my dissociation and the mechanism behind it, so I am glad this subreddit exists so I can share it with you.

First of all, I want to specify that **these experiments were done over 100 times**, because sometimes I couldnt resist the cravings and I cheated. All the products were eaten most of the time in isolation.

I have to **AVOID**:

1. **Dairy products**, especially conventional **milk A1** \- it contains **beta-casomorphines**, which is an opioid that intestifies dissociation. When I consume it, I become demented and **my attention span is non-existent**. I cant understand any shorts, reels or movies. Depersonalization also occurs and my mind is so blank that I dont have any ideas and neither motivation to talk. Some people say that goats milk is better, since it has less opioids, or even **milk A2** from Jersey cow, but it still has an effect on me.

2. **Wheat products**, like bread, pasta and pizza - has **exorphines** and **inflammatory aminoacids**. My IQ decreases by 15 points. The effect is more tolerable than dairy, but for optimal results I must avoid it. Lectins and phytates create inflammation in the gut and inhibits mineral absorption.

  
3. **Excess starches** \- No more than two meals a day. Starch granules, if remained undigested, they arrive into the bloodstream reaching the brain and **create inflammation**. (The clear mind that carnivore diet offers I believe is from a lack of starch and excess cortisol from protein breakdown). People who went through trauma have **increased gut permeability**, even though digestion is good, starches can still enter the bloodstream. It happens on potatoes and rice. The effects are quite different. **Rice makes me emotionally numb**, but concentration and sleep are pretty good. **Potatoes** does not decrease emotions, but **decreases libido** from too much **solanine**, which inhibits **acetylcholinesterase**, leading to **more accumulation of acetylcholine**. This, short-term gives me a **brain boost effect**, but at the same time decreases heart rate and libido. 

4. **Excess fructose** \- No more than 4 glasses of juice a day, **equivalent to 50g**. Some people can tolerate a lot, like my friend (easily 200g), but my ancestors I believe ate more starches. I am from the north of Romania, where sweet foods are not extremely common like in Italy. I had periods where I ate 500g of carbs a day from juices for months. I was hyperactive, ADHD, dissociated, but full of energy, probably from the excitotoxicity of unprocessed fructose that my liver had to deal with. I think **fructose increases dopamine but also norephedrine** that leads to dissociation.

5. **Excess caffeine** \- No more than a coffee a day and one or two glasses of coke.

6. **Social media, gaming and shorts/reels -** All the time, when I abuse them, I get heavy dissociation, **especially from gaming**. I remember when I was a child, my older brother used to cope via gaming, and when my narcissistic father yelled at him from the other room to come and send him to buy bread,  when he arrived he was completely out of body, not because of fear, but because he devoted his life in the game and forgot about the real world.

7. **Using headphones outside - exposing yourself to the real world** is key into overcoming dissociation

  
What **I do**:

  
1. **Eat a high carbohydrate diet with low fat** \- This promotes **glucose oxidation (Randle Cycle)**. There are studies showing how a high carb low fat diet **increases thyroid hormones by 30%** which are essential for transforming carbs into ATP (energy). This increased level of energy completely abolished my chronic fatigue syndrome, cured my sleep issues and decreased depersonalization. I always ate starches before sleep to get a good nights sleep.

2. **Pay attention to my senses** – **Being aware of how you feel, your mood, libido, and the level of dissociation/depersonalization/derealization at any given moment is crucial**. This feedback helps you determine what works and what doesn’t, and progress will be made. I know that while writing this post, I’m at a 7 out of 10 for mood and a 2 out of 10 for libido. It may be subjective to some degree, but the more you practice, the better it gets.

3. **Decrease stress - by eating carbohydrates**. This is key. Stress decreases when carbs are eaten and oxidized. **Cortisol**, a stress hormone, is a **back-up mechanism in case of no food**. Cortisol will catabolize (consume) your muscle to increase blood sugar. Sometimes if the metabolism is dysfunctional, like the majority of population, it will lead to adrenaline too, which will increase dissociation. **Knowing when you have hypoglycemia is key. The best sleep of my life was when I was eating carbs once every hour to keep stress at low levels, like bodybuilders did in the 60s.**

  
This is what came to mind at the moment.

I did also some experiments with **vitamin B1**, that increases **acetylcholine**. The effect was similar to eating plenty of potatoes. It gave me an **incredible verbal fluency, memory and dissociation completely disappeared**, but there were two downsides: **no libido and a too logical mind**. I couldnt joke around, I was taking everything literally. It didnt help in social situations, only if I had to argue about some topic. **Dr. Ray Peat**, said that there were experiments were a stimulating environment during development not only increased brain size in rats, but also **increased acetylcholinesterase** and breakdown of other stress hormones like cortisol, which is the enzyme that breakdowns acetylcholine. His emphasis upon acetylcholine is interesting, **he considers it a stress hormone**. 

Another experiment I did was with **Cyproheptadine**, which decreases serotonin, acetylcholine, and histamine. I don't believe serotonin is the ""happy chemical"" as mainstream media promotes. This drug is actually classified as an antidepressant. During my experiment, besides the antidepressant effects, I realized after about a month that dissociation increased. I wasn't sure whether it was due to a lack of 1. **Histamine** or 2. **Acetylcholine**. The effect seemed to be the opposite of acetylcholine. I was losing consciousness every few seconds, which was disturbing, and my confidence dropped to zero.

The last experiment was with **Selegiline**, which inhibits MAO-B in low doses (1.25 mg, half a pill). **It prevents the degradation of dopamine**, leading to an accumulation of it. This gave me confidence, drive, and abolished my depersonalization. There is no withdrawal because it takes up to two weeks for the recovery of MAO-B enzymes.

In the end, I think there is a combination of opioids, acetylcholine and dopamine. Opioids being the most important one. Having high opioid levels, dopamine cant be produced.

2.Foundation
3.Bold eyebrows
4.Short hair

1.Drinking coffee first thing, wants to prioritize protein and water first 
2.Comparing herself to others
3.Cutting back on reading murder mysteries because they don’t make her feel good
4.Cutting back on over editing photos/videos

Ins (Clancy)
1.Nourish bowls 
2.Buying quality clothes
3.Unfollowing ppl that don’t serve her
4.Ninja Creami recipes

Notable mentions from the episode:
Clancy laughing REALLY hard and loud at everything, it was worse than usual for some reason.
Gabi gave Clancy a compliment about how she had skin envy of her during their time reporting because it was so beautiful and even to which Clancy said “I have the most uneven skin”.

Hi everyone! 👋

I'm working on a Google Sheets project and could use some help automating the process of formatting and grouping stats for players. My goal is to take a dataset with player names, stats, and other details, and organize it into a clear, grouped table that includes icons for each stat category. also willing to provided coffee!!

 [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YcvRF6aZcvV8GTGkH7mvp6nl7idxiCgN8D5Ts6WgHFs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YcvRF6aZcvV8GTGkH7mvp6nl7idxiCgN8D5Ts6WgHFs/edit?usp=sharing)

# What I Have

* **Raw Data Columns**:
   * **Name** (Player name)
   * **Stat** (e.g., Points, Rebounds, etc.)
   * **Prize Pick Line**
   * **Last 5 %**
* **Goal**:
   1. Group stats by player name.
   2. Add icons to the stats in a new column.
   3. Ensure the table is clean and formatted for easy readability.

# Stat Categories and Icons

Here are the categories and their corresponding icons:

* 🅿️ **Points**: Points scored
* 🎯 **3-PT Made**: Three-point shots made
* 🎯🏀 **Pts+Asts**: Points + Assists
* 🎯🔄 **Pts+Rebs**: Points + Rebounds
* 🎯🛡️ **Pts+Rebs+Asts**: Points + Rebounds + Assists
* 🏀 **Rebounds**: Rebounding stats
* 🏀🔄 **Assists**: Assist stats
* 🏀🏀 **Rebs+Asts**: Rebounds + Assists
* 🎮 **Fantasy Score**: Fantasy points scored
* ⚡ **Turnovers**: Turnovers
* 🔐 **Blks+Stls**: Blocks + Steals

# Example Input and Desired Output

**Input:**

|Name|Stat|Prize Pick Line|Last 5 %|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Victor Wembanyama|Points|19.5|100.00%|
|Victor Wembanyama|Rebounds|11.5|80.00%|
|Nikola Jokic|Points|26.5|100.00%|
|Nikola Jokic|Assists|8.0|100.00%|

**Desired Output (Grouped by Player):**

|Name|Stat Category|Prize Pick Line|Last 5 %|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Victor Wembanyama**|🅿️ Points|19.5|100.00%|
||🏀 Rebounds|11.5|80.00%|
|**Nikola Jokic**|🅿️ Points|26.5|100.00%|
||🏀🔄 Assists|8.0|100.00%|

# What I Need

1. **Dynamic Grouping**: Group all stats for a single player under their name.
2. **Stat Icons**: Automatically append the correct emoji/icon to each stat category.
3. **Formatted Table**: The output should look clean and organized like the example above.
4. **Automation**: If possible, automate the process so I only need to paste in the raw data.

# What I’ve Tried

* **Manual Grouping**: Sorting by player and adding rows manually, but it’s time-consuming.
* **IFS Formula for Icons**:excelCopy code=IFS(     B2=""Points"", ""🅿️ Points"",     B2=""3-PT Made"", ""🎯 3-PT Made"",     B2=""Pts+Asts"", ""🎯🏀 Pts+Asts"",     B2=""Pts+Rebs"", ""🎯🔄 Pts+Rebs"",     B2=""Pts+Rebs+Asts"", ""🎯🛡️ Pts+Rebs+Asts"",     B2=""Rebounds"", ""🏀 Rebounds"",     B2=""Assists"", ""🏀🔄 Assists"",     B2=""Rebs+Asts"", ""🏀🏀 Rebs+Asts"",     B2=""Fantasy Score"", ""🎮 Fantasy Score"",     B2=""Turnovers"", ""⚡ Turnovers"",     B2=""Blks+Stls"", ""🔐 Blks+Stls"",     TRUE, B2 ) 
   * This works for icons but doesn’t solve the grouping issue.
* **Considered Apps Script**: I think a custom script could help automate grouping and formatting but I’m not sure how to write it.",6,1736361093.0,googlesheets,2,1.0,False
1hwr7qk,https://www.reddit.com/r/generativeAI/comments/1hwr7qk/i_published_a_full_music_album_i_generated_using/,"I published a full music album I generated using Suno, managed to get impressively consistent results across tracks [includes learnings and links to the music]","I have been using Suno for months, but as soon as I tried their new model (v4) I realized that it had the potential to create great, complete songs.

Over the last couple of weeks I put together 9 songs in a specific style I like, designing them as if they were produced by a real band. I paid a lot of attention to keep consistency in the vocals.

Each song cost me one coffee (for the creativity boost), $1 (for the AI model credits), and 1 hour of work (to draft lyrics, refine them with AI or manually, generate multiple versions, select the best one, polish it, and manually master the final track).

**You may listen to them** [**on Spotify**](https://open.spotify.com/album/1uvp7yDrgS1S9AV6HquElz) **or** [**on YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gguilGjt6JY&list=OLAK5uy_kJVHa0Ny5M6HtMEFvvMd8SQe93TnuvoXs)**.**



What I learned (and where tools can improve):

1. **Consistency Across Songs**: Maintaining a cohesive style across tracks is challenging. The tool doesn’t allow band name or style references, and features like ""personas"" and ""covers"" aren’t fully effective. However, if you write a very detailed style prompt, the model will generate songs in a small set of styles, some of which will have similar vocals.
2. **Iterative Song Creation**: Generating a great song in one go is rare. The best approach is to generate several attempts and pick the one that starts the most promising way, then extend and refine iteratively. There are complexities around getting the right timestamp to extend from, and sometimes including the current word/sentence of the lyrics vs. including only the lyrics for the rest of the song. The model may cut a word or repeat a sentence sometimes.
3. **Remastering**: The ""remaster"" feature can fix overly saturated tracks, but it occasionally alters lyrics or vocals in unexpected ways.
4. **Length and Noise**: The longer the song, the noisier it gets. For instance, every iteration of the chorus gets noisier, with more artifacts in the vocals and more layers of melody that get too fuzzy. You may be able to fix this by ""remastering"" afterwards, or may have to resort to manual compositing during post processing.
5. **Replacing a Section**: The ""replace section"" feature works reasonably, but sometimes it's really hard to select the right area and listen to it. The area to regenerate must be >10s (would be cool if that wasn't a requirement), and the generated snippet sometimes doesn't sound quite similar to the rest of the track, so sometimes requires applying a ""remaster"" afterwards.
6. **Stems**: The ""get stems"" feature generates stems that don't add up to the original track and often sound worse when combined.
7. **Autotune**: The model frequently produces vocals with the autotune effect. This probably comes from the training set, but sometimes is undesired and defining ""autotune"" as an excluded style doesn't really help, so sometimes you must just regenerate and hope for the best.
8. **Lyric Generation**: The ""ReMi"" lyric generation model is quite creative and fun to work with.

I (35M) got out of a seven year, monogamous relationship 6 months ago, though that relationship had ran its course a year prior. I’ve recently started dating again and met a guy (47M) a week ago. I’ve never dated anyone that much older than me before. The age gap does concern me a bit, but I am open to it. But I’m not sure how interested he is in me. 

We went on a coffee date that last for about four hours the day after he messaged me on Grindr. We ended it with a kiss after he walked me to my car.

I’m taking him out this Saturday (he said I beat him to the punch in asking for a third date), so it’ll be an official third date. 

I’m used to men texting me daily or every other day when they’re interested in me, even in the beginning of courtship. But he doesn’t text me and doesn’t seem to continue conversations through text either. Aside from coordinating our next date, we haven’t had any contact for about two days now. It’s not actually an issue personally for me, since I’m busy and not a great texter. I know he’s busy and has a relatively high stress job, same on my end, but I’m also not sure if this is a sign that he’s just not that interested in me. What do you all think?

Restaurant equipment refers to the tools and appliances used in a commercial kitchen to prepare, cook and serve food. It includes everything from kitchen appliances and utensils (such as ovens, refrigerators, food storage containers) to hardware and software (like kitchen display & point of sale systems).

 

# Essential restaurant kitchen equipment checklist

The exact tools and equipment your restaurant will need would depend on what type of food you serve and what type of service you run; a full-service restaurant doesn’t have the same needs as a quick-service burger joint. The tools you’ll end up buying will also depend on your budget. Restaurant equipment can cost anywhere from $75,000 to $115,000. With that said, there is some overlap between the equipment each restaurant needs.

Below is a comprehensive checklist that covers the essential kitchen equipment used by most restaurants.

# 1. Ovens

The oven is a central piece of commercial kitchen equipment in your arsenal. The type of oven you’ll need will depend largely on the type of restaurant and the food you will be serving. If you own a bakery, you might not need the same type of oven as a fine-dining restaurant. 

Choosing an oven can be a long process, which is why it’s important to know what to look out for. Keep these factors in mind when choosing the right oven for your restaurant:

# Size

The amount of space you have in your kitchen will determine the size of oven you should look for. Sitting down and crafting out your [commercial kitchen layout](https://www.restaurantsupply.com/search/?q=kitchen+equipment) will help you know how much space you actually have for your oven. Another important point is to think about how much food you are planning on preparing during a service to figure out what capacity you need.

# Quality

Your oven and range are the heart of your kitchen, so choosing something that can withstand the tests of time and use, can be the difference between success and failure. Make sure you take a look at the different brands, reviews, warranty and service agreements that might come with it. 

# Function

This will largely depend on the type of cooking you are planning on doing at your restaurant. The first step is to decide if you’ll want an electric or a gas stove. The next step is to figure out the type of oven you need. If you’re opening a bakery or a coffee shop, your requirements will be different than a fine dining restaurant. 

# Types of ovens

The type of oven (or ovens!) you need is going to depend largely on what you will be serving. Before starting your search, make a list of the types of foods you envision serving and this will help narrow your options. 

* **Commercial oven.** Most restaurants will have at least one commercial or standard oven. This type of oven is great for even-style cooking and ideal for baked dishes. Consider this a must for most restaurants.  
* **Convection oven.** Unlike commercial ovens, these ovens have fans that help circulate hot air. A convection oven is essential for bakeries and ideal for baking things like bread, pastries, pies and cookies, as well as toasting, roasting and dehydrating. 
* **Combination oven.** The combination oven is a mix of a convection oven and a steamer. The main plus of this type of oven is its versatility. With a combination oven, you can roast, steam, smoke, fry, bake or grill. You name it, the combi oven can do it.  
* **Pizza oven.** As the name suggests, this type of oven is used for making pizzas. Because of its high temperature, its use is not limited to just pizza making. With a pizza oven you can also handle anything from desserts to meats.
* **Conveyor Oven.** You’ve probably seen this type of oven at your neighborhood sandwich or pizza shop. In a conveyor oven, food passes through a conveyor belt where it heats up or gets cooked at a certain pace and heat

# 2. Ranges and ventilation

Once you’ve sorted the ovens out, you’ll want to start thinking of your ranges and ventilation. Your ranges are a key component of your cooking gear and your ventilation makes sure you keep the airflow comfortable for your staff. 

When it comes to ranges, you’ll have two options: Gas or electric. 

# Gas ranges

Gas ranges are known for their temperature control. These types of ranges start at your desired heat immediately and offer much more control than an electric range. Another plus? Gas ranges will keep on working even during a power outage. The downside? They are harder to clean and also come with a higher risk of a fire or gas leak. 

# Electric ranges 

Electric ranges are known for their efficiency. They are easy to clean and can cook food more evenly than gas ranges. Opting for an electric range will also reduce the risk of a fire or gas leak in your kitchen. The cons? Electric ranges can rack up a hefty electricity bill. 

# Ventilation 

Commercial kitchens can be an uncomfortable and crowded environment to work in. A ventilation system manages the airflow and temperature control all throughout your commercial restaurant kitchen, helping maintain a pleasant, clean and healthy environment for your staff. 

When choosing your ventilation plan there are five factors you need to consider: 

* **Air volume flow rate:** This is the rate at which air moves through your ducts. If you’re often grilling or cooking with an open flame you will require more ventilation than if you’re making pasta dishes. 
* **Static pressure:** This is basically the resistance or friction against the air that moves through your ventilation system. Balancing the static pressure is key in making sure the air flows properly and energy isn’t wasted.
* **Energy efficiency:** Finding the right balance with your fan’s horsepower is key in achieving efficiency. If your fan’s motor is underpowered, it will wear out fast, but if it’s overpowered, you’ll run the risk of wasting too much energy. 
* **Size:** Consider the size of your kitchen and how much space you have for a ventilation system. The placement of your fan will likely be decided based on available space or fire code safety requirements. This needs to be a key part of your commercial kitchen layout planning. 
* **Noise:** Fans can be loud and can add a considerable amount of noise to an already loud kitchen. Fan loudness is calculated in “sones” and a commercial kitchen fan should be between 7 and 21 sones. Make sure to keep the loudness of the fan in consideration when choosing your ventilation system. Your employees will thank you. 

# 3. Food processors

A food processor is a piece of kitchen equipment that can be used for chopping, slicing, shredding, grinding and pureeing different types of food. While there are many different types of food processors, there are four main types you should consider for your restaurant. 

# Batch bowl processor

Most commonly found in your house, it collects food as it’s processed. Kitchen staff can drop food vertically and choose the type of cut they want. With this type of processor, you can easily remove the bowl and empty its contents. 

# Continuous feed food processor

This type of processor allows you to constantly add food while it’s running and the processed food goes into a separate bowl—this is a great option for a commercial kitchen. 

# Buffalo choppers

Buffalo choppers are heavy-duty processors made of all-metal and can even process meat.  This might not be necessary for most commercial kitchens. 

# Combination processors

A good middle point combines batch and continuous processors by using an attachment. 

# 4. Mixers

If you are planning to make any bread or desserts, you need to invest in a commercial kitchen mixer. Select your mixer depending on the volume of food you’re planning to make and how often you will use it. 

# Floor mixers

This is one of the most popular types of mixers for a commercial setting. These models are high powered and can mix large amounts in a short amount of time. This is ideal for restaurants that are planning to use a mixer on a regular basis and at a high capacity. 

# Hand mixers

Also known as stick mixers or immersion blenders, these mixers are handheld and are great for blending things like soups and sauces. With this type of mixer, you can emulsify, chop or mix at high speeds.

# Countertop mixers

Countertop mixers are the mixers you’re probably used to seeing in small bakeries, small restaurants or even in home kitchens. These are great if you don’t have a very high output and aren’t working with a lot of space. 

# 5. Slicers

Just as the name suggests, slicers are a great tool for slicing things like meats and cheeses. While this might not be necessary for every restaurant kitchen, it will definitely come in handy if you plan on serving anything from sandwiches to cold cuts and charcuterie platters.  

When purchasing your slicer, consider the following depending on the needs of your restaurant: 

* Automatic or manual
* Blade size 
* Horsepower
* Light, medium or heavy-duty

# 6. Food prep counters and cutting boards 

Prep tables, counters and cutting surfaces are essential to your restaurant kitchen. Your staff will constantly be using it for different types of prep work, so you’ll need something that’s versatile and can last a long time. 

For your prep counters, stainless steel is the way to go. These counters are sturdy,  won’t absorb any bacteria and will withstand all the cleaning products you throw on them over and over again. On the line, be sure you have small refrigerators installed under your prep counters to keep things moving quickly. 

As for your cutting boards, plastic will be your best bet. Plastic is not as porous as wood, making it harder for bacteria to hide in the cracks. Plastic cutting boards are easier to clean and dishwasher safe, and will help you prevent cross-contamination. 

Pro tip: color-code your plastic cutting boards depending on the type of food you usually prepare on them.

# 7. Freezers and refrigerators

To keep your food fresh for as long as possible (and avoid any risk of food safety and health code violations you need to invest in quality freezers and refrigerators. 

First, you’ll want to consider the size and capacity of your restaurant and then the features. Ideally, you always want to opt for reach-in refrigerators—these are the most convenient for your staff. A walk-in cooler is also easy to use, safe and a great option if you have space and if your restaurant requires that much food storage. 

Next, you’ll need to consider the condenser. A condenser basically helps regulate the temperature of your freezer or refrigerator. For a condenser, you can either choose a top or bottom-mounted refrigerator. 

A top-mounted condenser is great at avoiding clogs and it doesn’t blow warm air into the fridge when opened. A bottom-mounted condenser is great in situations where cleaning and maintenance are the top priorities. These are often used in bakeries. 

Taking the time to look for the best possible refrigerator or freezer for your restaurant will help ensure the quality of everything you cook. So make sure this piece of equipment is at the top of your list of priorities!

# 8. Safety equipment

You’ve already done the legwork of all of the restaurant licenses and permits you need, so you know that health and safety are priority number one in this business.

In order to ensure the safety of your staff and customers, make sure you stock up on the following essential safety items:

* Fire extinguishers
* First aid kits
* Rubber floor mats
* Wet floor signs
* Aprons
* Oven mitts
* Goggles
* Hairnets
* Security cameras

# 9. Storage racks and shelving

Every kitchen needs good shelving and storage for dry food, utensils and equipment. Your storage choices need to be strategic and durable. This is not something you want to have to change or replace, so choosing the right material the first time should be a priority. 

When it comes to your storage or shelving, you have a wide variety of materials to choose from: Chrome wire, epoxy, coated, polymer, anti-microbial and stainless steel. Your choice will depend entirely on your budget, use and personal preference.  

When you’re buying your storage racks, ask yourself this: Is mobility important to you? If so, consider opting for mobile storage racks instead of stationary, or a combination of both. You might need to move your storage from time to time and if so, this will come in handy. 

Make sure to arrange your shelving in a way that makes sense and will allow your staff to find things easily and efficiently. Planning out your shelving and storage units is an important part of your commercial kitchen layout plan. 

# 10. Cooking equipment

Who has time to stop and wash the tasting spoon in between dishes? Not your staff. The best way to think about your cooking equipment quantity is in a shift. What will you need to execute an entire shift without washing a dish?  

Make sure you have ample amounts of the following items: 

* Pots and pans (of all sizes) with lids
* Spoons for mixing and tasting 
* Chef’s knives
* Mixing bowls
* Whisks
* Spatulas
* Ladles
* Tongs
* Baking pans
* Sheets and roasting pans
* Towels
* Rags 

# 11. Servingware

Any good chef knows that you need the right dishes (and utensils) to plate and serve every type of food. You’re going to need to stock up on cutlery, bowls of all shapes and sizes, ramekins, cups and glasses. Take stock of the various sizes of platters and plates you’ll need and then consider breakage. Be prepared for any eventuality!

These are the main types of servingware you need to acquire for your restaurant: 

* **Dishware:** plates, platters, bowls, serving plates and bowls. 
* **Glassware:** wine, cocktail, beer, water, dessert and specialty glasses. 
* **Flatware:** knives, spoons, forks, serving utensils 
* **Dinnerware accessories:** charger plates, ramekins, sauce cups, dessert dishes, plate covers, bread and butter plates, coffee mugs, teacups and saucers. 
* **Displayware:** baskets, appetizer and tasting dishes. 
* **Linens:** cloth napkins and tablecloths.

The amount of servingware you should buy depends entirely on your restaurant size and the types of dishes you’re planning on serving. 

Before ordering all your dishware ask yourself the following questions: 

* What is your table turnover rate? 
* How many seats are in your restaurant?
* What types of dishes are you serving? 
* How many people do you expect on your busiest days and times? 
* What are your most popular dishes? 
* What types of dishware do those popular plates require? 

This will help you make a better calculation of the amounts of each type of servingware you should buy. 

# 12. Storage containers 

A successful restaurant needs to be efficient at minimizing food waste. This means having the proper food storage containers and establishing best practices with your staff. Because of the different types of food used during the cooking process, it’s necessary to have an assortment of storage containers. 

Make sure to stock up on: 

* **Vegetable crispers:** great for keeping products fresh. 
* **Large ingredient bins:** use these to store dry ingredients like flour in bulk. 
* **Kitchen canisters:** useful for storing small amounts of ingredients like coffee or sugar. 
* **Dough boxes:** these are made for storing unbaked dough and will come in handy if you’re planning on baking bread or desserts. 
* **Food storage containers:** stock up on them in all shapes and sizes. You’ll never know when you’re going to need them.

Finally, stock up on things like masking tape and sharpies or a label maker. This will be useful whenever you’re labeling items or identifying their best-before date.   

# 13. Sinks

Sinks are used for three main purposes in your restaurant: dishwashing, food preparation and hand washing. In general, to meet health and safety requirements, you will likely need a certain minimum number of sinks plus a commercial dishwashing machine. 

Take a look at your respective country and region’s food regulations: 

* [United States Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/food/fda-food-code/state-retail-and-food-service-codes-and-regulations-state)
* [Canada Food Inspection Agency](https://inspection.gc.ca/eng/1297964599443/1297965645317)   
* [United Kingdom Food Standards Agency](https://www.food.gov.uk/)

These are different types of sinks you might need to take into account when building your commercial kitchen equipment list:

# Compartment sinks

Compartment sinks come in a variety of sizes and can add versatility to your kitchen sink game. If you opt for multiple compartments, you can use each sink for a certain activity like rinsing vegetables or hand washing. 

# Bar sinks

This type of compartment sink is usually placed on a lower level for ease of use and is often used to empty drinks and many other functions. It’s also often equipped with a speed rack to allow easy access for your barback or bartender during drink prep. 

# Disposal sinks

These sinks come equipped with a waste disposal system. Make sure to keep the disposal system covered when it’s not being used.  

# Drop-in units

These units are placed onto an existing surface like a countertop. 

# Hand washing sinks

As the name states, these are generally smaller sinks with the main purpose of allowing staff to wash their hands, to not contaminate other sinks. 

# Mop sinks

Mop sinks are also known as janitorial sinks and are mainly used for filling buckets and draining mops. These can be set up on the floor. 

# Portable sinks

These can either be sinks with drains, without a faucet or handwashing carts with water tanks. These are mainly used by outdoor or mobile vendors. 

# 14. Kitchen Display System (KDS)

Let’s face it, kitchens are busy. Yelling out orders and passing hand-written notes between the front and back of house can make a hectic night even more stressful and leaves room for plenty of mistakes. This makes kitchen display systems (KDS) a great add-on to your back-of-house restaurant hardware. 

With a KDS, your back-of-house staff gets access to orders in real-time, without any confusion. Orders can be easily modified and displayed, giving your kitchen staff all the information they need to complete the order correctly, and on time.

With a KDS like Lightspeed’s, you can keep track of turnaround orders with ticket times, and color-code orders to see what’s cooking and what’s ready to go. This allows your staff to properly manage orders and stay on top of everything throughout the night. Your KDS replaces the need for printers and paper tickets, making your business more efficient and sustainable at the same time. 

# 15. Point of sale system (POS)

A point of sale system (POS) is the hub of your restaurant operations and a key piece of restaurant kitchen equipment. You need it to keep track of everything from orders and transactions to customer relationship management and reporting. 

Some of the restaurant hardware often used alongside a POS system includes things like receipt printers, kitchen printers, cash drawers, iPad stands and payment terminals. 

**When looking for a POS, ask yourself the following questions to make sure it’s the best POS for you:**

* **Is it intuitive?** A user-friendly POS that’s easy to learn will come in handy when you’re training staff. An intuitive system will keep your staff happy and minimize mistakes.
* **Is it customizable?** Not every restaurant is the same, and neither should your POS. Find a POS company that’s willing to work with your restaurant to make the POS your own.
* **Does it offer offline features?** Imagine your internet goes down. You’ll want a POS with a fully-featured offline mode that allows you to continue your service without interruption. 
* **Does it offer customer relationship management capabilities?** Establishing a relationship with your customers is key for the success of your restaurant. Look for a POS with CRM capabilities like creating customer profiles, promotions and loyalty programs.
* **Is it mobile?** Offering the best service should be easy with your POS. You’ll want a cloud-based POS that will let you offer your customers on the spot service, no matter where they are seated.  
* **Does it offer multi-store capabilities?** If you own multiple locations or you’re thinking of adding a second location, having a POS that can grow as you grow will make your life easier and make transitions seamless. 
* **Does it have payments embedded?** Lightspeed Payments makes it easier than ever to serve guests and get paid, with one platform. With payments embedded, transactions are automatically recorded in your ePOS system, saving time and reducing errors because it eliminates the need for manual entry.
* **Does it offer reporting?** Knowing the numbers behind your business will help you make smarter business decisions. Find a POS that offers data like end of day reports, staff reports and more. 
* **Do they offer support?** Let’s face it, the restaurant industry is full of curveballs. You’ll want a POS that offers 24/7 support when you need it most. 

With Lightspeed, you can manage everything from tracking labor and handling transactions to customizing menus and creating customer profiles. Ideally, you want a POS that helps you work more efficiently, and not harder, allowing you more time for the things that matter most.

# 16. A steam table

To keep sauces and other prepped food warm throughout service, you’ll need a steam table. This will keep food in metal containers warm at a safe temperature for hours. 

# 17. Washing equipment

Soap and water aren’t all you need when it comes to keeping your commercial kitchen clean. 

Stock up on these products to ensure your kitchen is up to code every single shift: 

* Brushes for your griddles
* Mops
* Sponges
* Rags
* Commercial-grade cleaning products 

# 18. Sharpening stone

You’ve invested a ton of money into your kitchen utensils and everyone knows that the best knives work better when they are sharpest. To keep your knives in tip-top shape, you need to invest in sharpening stones. You may want to have more than one in the kitchen. This will ensure your prep staff can always chop, prep and do whatever they need with the best quality knives. 

# 19. Microwave

With all the kitchen equipment needed to run a restaurant, microwaves are often forgotten. But odds are you are not going to be cooking every single thing in your kitchen from scratch and you will need a commercial microwave. 

Microwaves will come in handy when it comes to steam cooking, reheating pre-cooked items or defrosting. Bottom line: you are going to need one. 

# 20. Ice maker

Whether you’re serving drinks at the bar or making sure every guest has a cold glass of water when they sit down, you’re going to need a good ice machine. Look out for an ice machine that’s constantly dispensing ice right into a bin so it’s ready for your staff to use at all times. 

# 21. Gas or electric grill

Everyone knows that the perfect steak or burger comes from a grill (also known as a griddle).  The best ones come with an added flat griddle surface perfect for making pancakes or grilling sandwiches.

The main issue with choosing a grill for your restaurant will likely be space. If you have an outdoor terrace, you could opt for a commercial outdoor grill, but otherwise, you will likely be purchasing an indoor grill. 

If having a grill is important for your type of cuisine, make sure to make the space for it when you’re planning out your restaurant layout. 

 

# Lifespan of restaurant kitchen equipment 

How long your restaurant equipment lasts will depend on several factors. The frequency of use, cleaning, level of maintenance and quality will all affect your equipment lifespan. The more you take care of it, the longer it will last. 

Although the duration and quality of equipment life can vary significantly, here are some general standards for estimating the lifespan of your restaurant equipment.

1. **Refrigerators and Freezers:** These can last anywhere between 10 to 20 years depending on the quality, usage, and maintenance. 
2. **Cooking Equipment:** Ranges, ovens, grills, and fryers can last between 10 to 15 years. Frequent cleaning and preventative maintenance can prevent common causes of breakdowns such as build-up of grease. 
3. **Dishwashers:** Commercial dishwashers for restaurants generally have a lifespan of 7 to 12 years. Cleaning your dishwasher and filter regularly will help extend its lifespan. 
4. **Small Appliances:** Blenders, mixers and food processors will have a slightly shorter lifespan. These can last between 5 to 10 years depending on the quality and frequency of use. 

You can extend your equipment’s lifespan with proper maintenance, cleaning and repair, saving you money in the long run. 

 

# Financing & buying kitchen tools and equipment

If you want to purchase your restaurant equipment outright but don’t want to hand over a large sum of money upfront, there are financing options available. If you have an established business in good standing, a traditional business loan may be available to you. However, depending on where you live, most traditional banks may not want to lend to someone without any successful business history to back it up, so you’ll have to go with an alternative such as a personal loan or line of credit.

Another option? Lightspeed Capital, the flexible funding built for your restaurant. Lightspeed Capital frees you from the constraints of traditional financial aid, so you can grow your business with easily accessible, renewable funding, whether you want to invest in new ovens or kitchen display screens.

# Leasing vs. renting restaurant kitchen equipment

Restaurant equipment is pricey and the costs can add up quickly, especially when you have to buy all of the large appliances on top of the smaller items like utensils and safety equipment. To help with the costs, restaurant owners often look at the option of buying new versus buying used restaurant equipment. Like all things in this business, there are pros and cons to each option.

# The pros of buying used commercial kitchen equipment for restaurants

This can include low cost due to depreciation—as soon as a stove leaves the showroom, like a car, it loses its value so even if it’s barely been used you can get a great deal. Additionally, due to the high rate of failure in this industry, it can be easy to find gently used equipment for restaurants for a great price.

# The cons of buying used commercial kitchen equipment

Can include unforeseen damages and no warranty—you’re responsible for the damages there. Additionally, you have less of a selection and quantity when you opt for used.

When it comes to buying new versus used, consider priorities and keep in mind that some items are better to buy used (ovens) than others (freezers).

# Where to buy restaurant equipment

There are a number of options available when it comes to buying restaurant kitchen equipment.

* Local restaurant supply stores. If you aren’t sure what brand or style of kitchen tools and equipment you are looking for, a salesperson at a local supply store can walk you through your options. If there are multiple restaurant supply stores in your area, you can shop around to find the best deals and make a more informed decision.
* Online stores. If you already know exactly what you want, you may want to save time driving around by ordering your kitchen equipment from an online supply store, such as Webstaurant Store or [RestaurantSupply.com](https://www.restaurantsupply.com/restaurant-equipment).
* Secondhand. To save money you may be thinking about purchasing some more expensive items secondhand. If you are purchasing from someone you don’t know via sites like Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace, make sure you are getting an item in good condition at a fair price. If you’re unsure what to look for, bring along a friend or colleague who knows what to look for.

 

# What to consider before purchasing your kitchen tools and equipment

When deciding on the right equipment for your restaurant or kitchen, it is important to begin the process by considering the following four factors.

* Determine the type and volume of food you plan to serve
* Available space in your kitchen, as well as your budget
* Durability and reliability of the equipment
* Ensure the equipment complies with health and safety regulations

Doing your research as well as comparing and looking at reviews will be the best way to get started in looking for some higher-priced products like your refrigerator and oven. Knowing what you need ahead of time, and making a list of all the different pieces of equipment will help you concretize your needs if you need to apply for financing and loans.",1,1736360797.0,u_Real_E_Guy22,1,1.0,False

1hwr31o,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hwr31o/please_help_messy_marriage_40m_36f/,Please help messy marriage 40m 36f ,"I've struggled lately with mental health and this seems to be where people go for faceless advice.

My husband and I are having problems again and I don't know what to do it's making me really struggle with day to day activities.

Some background,

My husband (40m) and I(36f) have been together since I was 19 married when I was 22.

Everything started strange from the moment we got married, we didn't even consummate the marriage for 6 months.
I had to beg to just annul it to get anywhere even somewhat moving forward.

I was working all the time before issues came up again my husband was on the road a lot and our lives became opposite of each other.
He was very belittling, started screaming at me a lot.
The ptsd got so bad (he is a 5 time combat veteran I'm not blaming this struggle of his) I couldn't even go to stores if he was home he was always trying to fight with me or random people who looked at me.

I wasn't aware he was addicted to p0rn and Craigslist girls either which I found out before I found out the next news.
While we where homeless and I was the only one working. That was hard on me.
He almost died as well and it shook both of us up a lot we clung to each other afterwards.

I found out when I was 26 he had cheated on me with my best friend a few years earlier, this shook my entire foundation of life he had lied, she had lied till she didn't anymore.
She had also implied he fathered her child he didn't and she knew that but it didn't help in the spiral.

I forgave him or at least I thought I did it brought out done really dark times for me I struggled with depression and alcohol heavily after.

I made some bad decisions but after I found out it's like we both changed.

I also should mention my husband has severe bipolar and ptsd as a result of military service.

He got very mean during this time yelling at me about the most insane things all the time like how stupid I am for not hitting a light switch on the way out the door or not doing things basically to his standard.

At this time I mostly cried and hid when he was angry drank when he was at work avoiding him and hanging out with roommates.

It made me mean at times so far back then I just lashed out at other people.

We went to a thing together with friends and I got really drunk and hurt myself so bad that it took me months to heal.

I also embarrassed him due to being blackout drunk and just freaking out about how I hated him trying to get keys from him.
He told me I was hitting him, I trashed the place we where all at.
When I injured myself no one was willing to help me because of how I had acted and I went outside still drunk and looking for help and almost died due to the nature of where we where.
Some people found me I was so intoxicated I couldn't remember my mother's phone at the time.

He decided to forgive me, but it came with a down time for me and healing.
He punished me pretty hard during the process I lived in an upstairs room at the time he wouldn't help me up or bring stuff down so I had to crawl up and down for months.
I finally left because the abuse yelling and name calling turned physical a few times and he once pushed me to the ground off the device I had to use to get around.

I left and he wouldn't even help me through our gate so I had to throw the device over and climb out of the addition to my parents car.

This segment of life sat with me very hard I started to see my husband as just an abuser and I thought I was done.

Then we went on a life changing thing together suddenly I met some family I didn't know I had and I had been battling with infertility for years.
He was so protective during the process I started seeing him in a new light, it's as if we both hit restart and for a while after meeting my family and bio dad things seemed like they would be okay.

I was traumatized because of my bio dad and I think I used my husband as a life raft in that situation.

We had found a place where he yelled less and threatened me and my life less and I really thought it could be fixed.

We talked and I basically told him I wanted a family I did not want all this so we needed to figure out the future or divorce.
This is when I start contemplating divorce on and off instead of just self harm.

He agreed to go to counseling and a doctor so I could see why I never could get pregnant.

We did the doctor but not counseling he was extremely opposed to it and wanted to keep us private.
I agreed because things where overall different maybe not entirely better but different and he made a lot of promises about the future and fatherhood and I got pregnant so quickly after I started the drugs I didn't have time to think really.

During my pregnancy my step father died and my family fell apart on my mother's side.
My husband again stepped up and handled more than he ever should have had to.
He watched my dreams be taken from me by a bunch of people and my job suddenly go away due to my pregnancy happening so fast.

Things where not perfect but he was yelling less and only a few huge fights during my pregnancy.
He had started tearing our house apart and it seemed to be helping at the time.
He tore to much out and we couldn't get most of it back together before the baby came which led to a lot of uncomfortable things including coming back from birth to no bathroom.

I had begged and begged for that bathroom I did not want to go back to a gutted house with a baby and deal with my personal healing without a bathroom.

We still don't have one my daughter is 4 this makes me so very sad.
Her whole life has been construction and waiting for things to be normal.
We just got a kitchen that works and that's been a blessing gives me something to hold onto.
Something in my home that feels sorts mine and not just his.

After I had the baby fighting started up again first over the baby weight it took me a little over a year to lose it all and honestly I lost it fast because of the stress of losing my family and breastfeeding.
I literally spent most of the time sleeping, crying, feeding the baby repeat.

I think he hated who I became mom me isn't super focused on him and his care anymore he just started telling me everything wrong with me and the aggressive name calling started again.

I hate being called names like b*tch, c◇nt, assh0le.
Like it really messes with my mind.

Fast forward to what is currently going on with us or this will become a novel.
I'm trying to give as many details as I can and fighting now is more 2 sided.
I lost it becoming a mom I threatened him back the very first time he called me a b*tch after I became a mom.
I really just took it and cried before.
I think  I was young and couldn't then I was scared for a while.
Then I messed up by getting drunk like I did so I blamed myself for my treatment for a long time.

Had a baby boom I fight back now and I fight back hard.
Its not healthy but there for a bit my mind was very much like,
How dare you after everything I've done,seen,and put up with how dare you come at me like this.

I tried just telling him we would divorce if he kept it up, but he threw a cup at me once holding the baby in the shower and a few months later he destroyed a keyboard in front of her and me and it scared her really bad.

At this time I'm just telling him to get a better attitude or get out.
There where moments of trying back and forth he did randomly do a nice thing or hug me back it just felt like so little so late.

I basically started looking at houses and moving forward with the this is just going to be over mentality.
We had some money coming and versus us doing anything else together I continued to offer to leave so he could just be without us.

Ugh it's gonna get muddy 

Then one day when he's being nice he just asked me if I had issues with my sexuality.
I say what do you mean? 
He just asked if I was into women.
I am kinda I had not thought about it in a sexual context in years.
I mean stuff had happened but he was the one who initially shamed me for it.
Then when we had roommates a 3some happened once we where all pretty drunk and he claimed he didn't realize he had sex with the roommate.

But like I'm married. I'm a mom. And he seemed really negative towards it.
Until now 

So we started talking guys, like we hadn't in years.
Just the thrill of it him wanting me talking to me about my feelings, someone cared about me right? 
I felt invigorated like I could share things with my spouse without having negative connotation associated with everything I did.
I think i let it turn into a fetish for him before we ever made a move.
We agreed that it would be cool if I started finding those parts of myself and I was afraid I was basically unwilling to do anything without him.
So I started talking to people and he was all about it at first.

Anyway I found a willing participant that was oy interested if he was involved unicorn 🦄 I suppose.

Everything was good the first time I wasn't as included as I wanted to be since it was supposed to be about me exploring with another woman.

It seemed like I was there to keep the transitions between the 2 of them going.

We talked about it and agreed next time we would focus more on me.

So next time comes
He's mad I brought up my feelings just before and he was literally calling me a b*tch 5 minutes before our 2nd 3some with this girl.

It went even more in his favor this time I was only there to keep them company.
But her ass was in play and this was the reason I should have understood better that it was going to be more avoid him.
He hadn't gotten to see his royal oats either we got married young so he was gonna get his too.

Okay,
So next time 
It was more about all 3 of us but not with him just when it was me and the other girl. He still mostly just had her. I was getting feelings for the girl because we talked a lot and it was just confusing.
She ended up cutting it off because I'm way to emotional and she just isn't.

It hurt but such is life when you make choices based on things fixing other things.
I know that not how it works.

I licked my wounds,
Talked to my husband in depth about my feelings did reading, wanted aftercare, wanted us all to talk about things before sex in future situations.
I didn't want to do things wrong.
I really just wanted a girl to like me too.

So we start talking to another girl this time both separate conversations so we can all find our own links.
I talked to her a lot about my feelings and what I wanted out of this out of life.
She and I seemed on the same page and it was cute watching him and her flirt it made him nicer to me and it just seemed more right this time.

We talked for months then it was time to meet go out and see how we all clicked.

Since we all had been talking separately I didn't realize how just sexual their conversation had become.
It wasn't like I can't wait to get noth of you together 2 girls and me hot right?

No he just promised a bunch of things to do to her how many times she was gonna get off.

We go to dinner shes not even interested in me yall had the oddest dinner ever they finally hot to talking about her work and stuff got evened out so we decided to come to my house for drinks.

Dude he literally just had me eat her out then he basically just had sex with her there was one switch several occasions I'm just like awkwardly holding people's hands? 

Like we talked we watched p*rn we read articles why am I sitting here.

It ended with both of us bent over the bed he gave me like 10 seconds before just going back to her and holding my hand. After literally another 15 minutes of him pounding her just next to me not even trying to touch me.
I mouthed fuck you when he finally looked at me.
Did he stop? Nope she got her 7 orgasms and they went to bed.
My fucking hand again lolol I am damaged 
I left the room and cried basically till she left.

I was destroyed yall my whole life was just a facade, I thought we did this for me.
He didn't even really want to fuck me if someone was there.
I had now watched this multiple times being told it wasn't like that and it would be about me next time.

Stuff got dark for me. The yelling was more constant I think about self exit all the time Now, I don't even have a husband everything had shattered.

He was calling me names for a month telling me how miserable my depression was making everyone and how I needed to snap out of it.
He even told me a couple times to just end it and stop bitching.

He let me know he's not even into 2 girls together, he was trying his best and its not his fault.

Hold on to your seat 

I decided to do it again 
The problem was me communicating properly right? 

And he didn't want to have to fuck those girls they aren't even his type so it's all my fault.

I find someone else he agrees to we all talk stuff is getting cute at home.

I feel like I did this just for the attention I was getting in between yelling and telling me how stupid I am, how ugly I am, how ashamed of me his is.
Its a break where he acts like shit is about me.

Anyway we are talking to this girl we have a lot in common we decided to spend a couple days together the first time.

Don't do this if anything happens you are trapped.

We go out and he gets real drunk I mean legit real drunk.
I was drunk but he was puking for a bit then took a bath when we get back to the room.

So while he's sick he makes a bug deal about us not stopping anything on account of him.
We had been flirting, I've been talking to this girl for a minute... like a couple months.
Turns out she doesn't like girls like that...???? 
So literally drops this on me when I'm already in her pants.
So I feel like great maybe we can just kiss around she just gets naked and I didn't want to make anyone uncomfortable I literally don't know what to do so I check on him he's going to rally any minute okay...
So I won't be alone for long.

I eat her out until he's done literally just eat her out he throws the door open from the bathroom like he's a stud we have been yearning for.

Acts like he's gonna be all into both of us for a minute, touching us kissing us rubbing us all the jazz.
Doesn't even start with me bangs the shit out of this girl for a cool minute.
Then it's my turn yay I get a couple minutes while I eat her out...
She doesn't eat pussy so I'm like literally in this alone.

Then he moves her further into the middle of the bed so they can missionary, I act uncomfortable he tries to get me to sit on her face.
She doesn't do that so they continue I like pinch her ripples and stuff like that whole he's doing it.

I get bored yall he had switched her to another position and I left.
It was like another hour I checked periodically they did not care.
He moved her to a couch so he could get deeper in her I guess.

I made a coffee had a cigarette and after around an hour when they are back on the main bed I go back in and try to insert myself 

He's done he's going to another room to sleep she's already asleep.

He fully fucked this girl to completion without me even there then held her whole she fell asleep then left me with her alone.

I followed him and tried to talk a little bit 
I was sobbing it was more of a beg I begged him just to understand I was his wife and I was literally thinking about just going home.

He yelled at me told me he was to drunk to deal with me. Said he would talk to me later he needed sleep.
She woke up and wanted to suck his thing together so I went with her I did not know what to do.
He declined I assumed he would because shortly before he had been yelling at me about how I'm just doing shit in purpose to mess with him.

We have a whole day now she headed out for a bit so we could talk and agreed not to do anything else unless I led or was involved.

She came back and he fucked her again sober although he did stop this time when I said I'm done fed up and walked out.

He said why I said she's not even into me I don't want to just watch another my husband cuck fest again.

I should backstory I was very afraid of being cuckcolded I had an ex when I was 16 he was 30 he made me watch him with a few of my friends and it really damaged me.
He agreed he would never ever make me feel that way.

So that was the end to my sexy friend dream I have people constantly hit on me I don't even want to look at myself.
I thought I was exploring my sexuality in a safe way with consenting adults but my consent was taken and stomped on.

He made a lot of comments about wanting younger and younger girls.
He made a lot of comments about me not being as good as women he before.

I hate myself and my old body I cry often when I see myself naked and a lot of my life is still just watching my husband in that room bang my friend as if I'm not there.

I hate my life most days I  struggle to get up and do anything.
I do anyway I care for our daughter she's extremely smart and I'm proud of that.
I'm looking for work.

My husband now calls me names, yells at me anytime I talk about my depression.
He literally started singing about how I was at bitch last night.

I cry everyday I don't know what to do I want love back but I think I ruined it.
I have been trying to have a real conversation about my feelings and my depression I can't handle being made fun of like this.
I can't handle my own memories.

My poor little girl knows daddy hates mommy but loves her.
She tries to make me feel better and it's crushing.
My dad always told me men are about themselves and no one else.
I dont want to believe it but I'm sitting here looking at 40 down the road questioning my life.
I feel like he's ruined it, and I know I hold a lot of fault in all this.

I go through phases where I am mean back just to realize that's not who I am.
I have been trying to have healthy conversations but he literally makes fun of me or just changes the subject to him.

I am really depressed and I am not working and I'm at the mercy of someone who really doesn't even seem to like me.
But when I bring up divorce he's suddenly willing to work on things.

Keeps telling me he's in therapy and trying and as soon as we can get approved for therapy we will now go.
Like how do I love myself after all this? 
I can't even just leave I don't have a job right now I'm looking.
I love him I'm not sure if he loves me I'm not a man but I do think at a minimum after everything I shouldn't be called a dumb b*tch every week.
He was nice when we met, he loved everything.
He blames me for his own depression and I may have caused it.
I dont know anymore

I will try to answer questions.
This is long enough as it is.

I dont even know why I'm writing it.

Does anyone have any advice on happiness? How do I even like myself now?

Sincerely,
Hopelessly searching for my soul.",1,1736360766.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

The kitchen is often considered the heart of the home, and having the right home supplies kitchen can transform it into a functional and inviting space. Whether you are a seasoned chef or merely enjoy preparing meals for family and friends, investing in quality kitchen supplies is essential for efficiency and enjoyment.

One of the most crucial categories of home supplies kitchen includes cookware. High-quality pots and pans not only enhance cooking performance but also ensure even heat distribution. Look for non-stick options for hassle-free cooking and easy cleanup, as well as durable materials like stainless steel for long-lasting use.

Proper kitchen utensils are equally important. Versatile tools such as spatulas, whisks, and measuring cups can make a significant difference in your cooking experience. Silicone utensils are a popular choice, as they are heat-resistant and won’t scratch your pots and pans. Additionally, having a robust set of knives is vital for food preparation, allowing precise cuts and improved safety in the kitchen.

Organization also plays a key role in maintaining a functional kitchen. Home supplies kitchen should include storage containers and racks to help manage ingredients and equipment. Clear bins for pantry items and magnetic strips for knife storage can save space and time during meal prep.

Finally, don’t overlook small appliances that can boost your kitchen’s capabilities. Essentials like blenders, food processors, and coffee makers not only add convenience but can also inspire culinary creativity. For anyone looking to elevate their cooking game, the right home supplies kitchen is indispensable.

In summary, whether you are upgrading your kitchen or starting from scratch, focusing on high-quality home supplies kitchen is essential for creating a space that is both functional and enjoyable. Invest wisely, and your kitchen will reflect your culinary aspirations.

1hwr0oy,https://i.redd.it/0dneelvjbtbe1.jpeg,Aberdeen city footfall,"The council released their business toolkit today.

https://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/services-business/business-toolkit

Interestingly this included footfall figures, for the past few years weve been inundated with anecdotal stories about how awful the city centre is, but never any figures despite the shopping centres and Aberdeen inspired being in possession of them.

The summary is below, and it doesn’t seem to paint the same picture business groups and the P&J  present.

I’ve seen Aberdeen Inspired figures and they aren’t as high as this, however their collection method is done via cameras whereas ACC is collected via mobile data so not sure which is more effective/accurate.

The map shows the area of footfall data, and information gleaned from 1 January 2024 to 31 October 2024, includes:

Total number of visitors for the year to date has risen 13.2% on last year

Total number of visitors to date compared to 2019 (pre-Covid) is down 2%

Total number of visitors in Q3 2024 is up 23.3% on the same quarter last year

Busiest day of the year so far was Friday 30 August
The highest percentage of visitors (24%) were recorded from 3pm to 6pm, followed by 12midday to 3pm (22%)

Next highest percentage of visitors was 9am to 12midday (17%), 6pm to midnight (16%), 6am to 9am (15%), and 12midnight to 6am (7%)

79% of the visitors to the city centre came from the North-east, 17% were from the rest of Scotland, and 2% the rest of the UK

Would be good to see the full dataset, I hope some of the reporters lurking here would press some business groups for footfall figures or even set up their own cameras.",9,1736360604.0,Aberdeen,11,0.85,False

Honestly sometimes I think I am or that I either didnt have a problem or it went away entirely. (right now i thought i fixed it by quitting coffee and sugar(somewhat) but im not so sure anymore).

I feel like I'll go through periods where I'm just kinda chill, happy, maybe sounding a bit hyper in the past (prior to quitting coffee). Not really an issue, but everythings fine... then I'll spiral into coffee giving me alot of paranoia, possibly worse cause I used to think i was being secretely microdosed for a while and at times thought college was keeping tabs on me and certain people were watching me secretely.

It would tumble further and further and get kinda bad... felt like i needed to get away from home asap due to the microdosing, thought my thoughts were seeping into others sometimes. Then it stopped? peoples minds stopped being porous and (ik how this sounds) but I stopped being able to send thoughts.  (also sounds weird but after quitting coffee I go into thinking someone or something is messing with my brain intentionally.  Which... sounds weird.

And it was like everything stopped. And it keeps happening over and over again. coffee seems to stop it and reset the loop at times.

And I probably should bring it up to a doctor but at the same time I feel like the doctor will either think im malingering for some reason or I think that I am just making a mountain out of a molehill and need to work on my anxiety and thats it. (and that im just hyper sensitive to coffee... 2 cups max but the tea I drink might bump it up a little).

My familly thinks its fine, but I didnt talk to them about it and they arent really into mental health all that much for reasons. I mean half the time its not affecting my life all that much aside from the paranoia bits but thats manageable with quitting coffee. Only time it really scared me was when everything kept digging into the weirdness for longer than I thought it would, and I started convincing myself that nothing i ever thought was weird at all and i thought i was communicating to something that wanted me to do something benign spiritually.

1hwqyvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersGroup/comments/1hwqyvb/new_book_idea_the_blood_divide/,(new book idea) The Blood Divide,"**Chapter 1: Midnight Shadows**

The rain was relentless, hammering down on the City of Midnight as if trying to wash away its sins. Nathaniel Cross sat in his dimly lit office at the precinct, the scent of stale coffee and damp leather clinging to the air. His desk was cluttered with case files and half-finished paperwork, a chaotic reflection of the man himself.

Outside his window, the city flickered with neon lights that barely pierced the gloom. Midnight was supposed to be a fresh start, a place where vampires and humans could coexist after centuries of bloodshed. Instead, it was a powder keg waiting for a spark.

Nate scowled as he flipped through the latest case file. Clare Sutton, 22, gone without a trace. The photo stapled to the corner showed a young woman with bright eyes and a hopeful smile—a face full of life that would likely end up drained and lifeless in a back alley somewhere. Missing persons weren’t uncommon in Midnight, but they were rarely solved.

He set the file down and rubbed his temples. His head throbbed, a dull ache that never seemed to go away. He’d been working this job too long, and the city was eating him alive. But quitting wasn’t an option—not for someone like him.

A sharp knock on the glass pane of his office door pulled him from his thoughts. He looked up to see Chief Harland, his broad shoulders filling the doorway. The man had a face carved from stone, with deep lines that spoke of too many sleepless nights and too many compromises.

“Cross. My office. Now.”

Nate sighed, grabbing his coat as he stood. “What now?” he muttered under his breath.

Chief Harland’s office was no sanctuary. It was as grim and utilitarian as the rest of the precinct, with filing cabinets threatening to burst and the faint smell of cigar smoke hanging in the air. The only personal touch was a faded photograph of Harland and his family, taken long before the city had claimed him.

“Sit,” Harland said, gesturing to the chair opposite his desk.

Nate slumped into the seat, his posture radiating reluctance. “What’s this about?”

Harland slid a folder across the desk, the tab labeled *Evelyn Voss*. Nate’s eyes narrowed as he picked it up.

“A new assignment,” Harland said. “And a new partner.”

Nate froze. His jaw tightened, and he threw the folder back onto the desk without opening it. “Not interested.”

Harland’s expression didn’t change. “It’s not a request. This comes from higher up.”

“I don’t do partners.”

“You do now. There’s a task force being formed. Off the books, high priority. You’re leading it, and Voss is your second.”

Nate shook his head. “No way. I’m not babysitting some rookie.”

Harland leaned forward, his voice dropping to a low rumble. “Voss isn’t a rookie. She’s one of the best we’ve got. Sharp, efficient, and experienced in fieldwork. You’ll need her.”

Nate snorted. “She’s a vampire.”

“And she’s better at this job than half the humans in this precinct. You don’t have to like her, Cross, but you will work with her. That’s an order.”

Nate stood, his fists clenched at his sides. “You can’t expect me to trust her—not after what they did.”

Harland’s gaze softened, but his tone remained firm. “I know what happened. But this isn’t about your past—it’s about this city’s future. We’re hanging by a thread, and you’re one of the few people keeping it together.”

For a long moment, Nate didn’t move. Then, with a sharp nod, he turned and stalked out of the office.

The bullpen was alive with noise, a constant hum of voices and the sharp clatter of keyboards. Nate strode through it like a storm cloud, his scowl enough to part the crowd. He didn’t need to look to know that eyes were on him. Half the precinct probably already knew about this new assignment, and the other half would by the end of the day.

He reached his desk and dropped into his chair, rubbing a hand over his face. The folder Harland had given him sat in his lap, unopened. He didn’t need to read it. He’d seen enough vampires in his time to know what kind of person he was dealing with. They all had that same air of superiority, that barely concealed hunger in their eyes.

“Cross?”

The voice was sharp, clipped, and entirely too close. Nate looked up to see a woman standing at the edge of his desk. She was tall, her black suit perfectly tailored, and her green eyes locked onto his with an intensity that was unsettling. Evelyn Voss. She didn’t look like the vampires Nate was used to dealing with—no gothic flair or predatory smirk. Just a cold, calculated professionalism that somehow felt worse.

“You must be Voss,” he said, leaning back in his chair. His tone was laced with disdain. “Nice to see Harland wasn’t exaggerating.”

“And you must be Nathaniel Cross,” she replied. Her voice was smooth, with just a hint of an accent Nate couldn’t place. “I’ve heard... mixed reviews.”

He smirked. “Let me guess—too angry, too stubborn, doesn’t play well with others?”

Her expression didn’t change. “Something like that.”

Nate gestured to the empty chair across from his desk. “Well, if we’re going to be stuck together, you might as well sit down.”

She hesitated, just for a moment, before taking the seat. Her movements were precise, controlled, like she was always calculating her next move. Nate hated it.

“Let’s get one thing straight,” he said, leaning forward. “I don’t trust you. I don’t like you. And I sure as hell don’t want you on my team. But Harland seems to think you’re worth something, so I’ll give you a chance. One chance. Don’t screw it up.”

Her lips twitched, the closest thing to a smile he’d seen. “Noted.”

The tension between them was palpable, drawing the attention of a few nearby officers. Nate ignored them, focusing instead on the case file in front of him. He didn’t care how good Voss was supposed to be. As far as he was concerned, this partnership was doomed from the start.

Voss didn’t say much after that, content to let the awkward silence fill the space between them. Nate worked through the case file, flipping through pages with more force than necessary. He could feel her watching him, studying him, and it grated on his nerves.

“You’re staring,” he muttered without looking up.

“I’m assessing,” she corrected. “You have a reputation, Cross. It’s... interesting to see if you live up to it.”

“And what’s the verdict so far?”

She tilted her head slightly, her green eyes narrowing. “You’re angry. Very angry. But you’re also methodical. Even when you’re pissed, you’re thorough. That’s rare.”

Nate snorted. “Spare me the psychoanalysis. I’m not one of your case studies.”

“I wasn’t aware I needed your permission to form an opinion,” she said smoothly.

He slammed the file shut, the sharp sound drawing a few glances from nearby desks. “Look, Voss, if you think this little task force is going to be some bonding exercise, you’re in for a rude awakening. We’re not friends. We’re not partners. We’re two people forced into the same corner.”

“Understood,” she said, her tone so neutral it made his teeth grind.

Nate stood abruptly, grabbing his coat. “I need some air.”

He stalked toward the exit, leaving Voss sitting there. He needed space, distance, something to clear his head before he said something he couldn’t take back.

Outside, the rain had slowed to a drizzle, the streets shimmering under the dim glow of streetlights. Midnight never really slept; there was always movement, always noise. Nate lit a cigarette, taking a long drag as he leaned against the precinct’s brick wall.

The memories hit him before he could push them back, creeping into his mind like a cold fog.

It was a night much like this one, years ago, before Midnight had even been conceived. He’d been a different man then—idealistic, hopeful, stupid.

They’d been called to a small town on the outskirts of nowhere. Reports of strange disappearances, livestock slaughtered, families vanishing. Vampires, though the word hadn’t been spoken out loud. Back then, most people didn’t believe in them. Nate had been one of them.

The first body they found was a boy, no older than ten. His throat had been torn out, his skin pale as snow. The house was empty, the rest of the family missing, but the bloodstains told a clear story. They hadn’t gone quietly.

They followed the trail to a farmhouse on the edge of town. The windows were boarded up, the air thick with the stench of death. Nate had gone in first, his partner close behind. What they found inside still haunted his nightmares.

Bodies, dozens of them, strung up like cattle in a slaughterhouse. The blood had been drained from them, collected in barrels that lined the walls. And in the center of it all was a vampire—a woman with eyes like molten gold and a smile that chilled his soul.

She’d killed his partner before he could blink, moving faster than anything he’d ever seen. Nate had barely gotten a shot off before she was on him, her claws ripping through his flesh like paper. He’d thought he was going to die that night, but somehow, he’d survived. The scars on his chest were a constant reminder of how close he’d come.

The memory faded as his cigarette burned down to the filter. Nate crushed it under his heel, his hands shaking. He hated them—every single one of them. And now he was supposed to work with one? It was almost laughable.

He heard the door open behind him and turned to see Voss stepping out, her expression unreadable. She didn’t say anything, just stood there, watching him.

“Didn’t take you for a smoker,” he said, his voice rough.

“I’m not. But you seemed... agitated.”

Nate laughed bitterly. “That’s one word for it.”

She hesitated, then stepped closer. “I know this isn’t easy for you. It’s not easy for me, either. But we don’t have to like each other to do the job.”

“Is that supposed to be some kind of pep talk?”

“It’s reality,” she said. “You don’t trust me, and I get that. But we’re on the same side, whether you believe it or not.”

Nate studied her for a long moment, searching for any hint of insincerity. He didn’t find any.

“Fine,” he said finally. “Let’s get one thing straight, though. You screw up, and I won’t hesitate to call you out. Got it?”

“Crystal clear,” she said, her lips quirking into a faint smile.

He didn’t return it.

The next few days were tense, the kind of tension that settled in the pit of Nate’s stomach and refused to let go. Voss moved through the precinct like she belonged there, her sharp eyes taking in everything and everyone. Nate hated how composed she always seemed, like nothing could touch her.

He, on the other hand, felt like he was unraveling. Every sideways glance from his colleagues, every muttered comment about “working with one of them,” only added to the weight on his shoulders. He didn’t want this, didn’t ask for it, but now it was his cross to bear.

By the third day, Harland called them into his office.

The chief’s office was cluttered, the walls lined with old case files and commendations that no one bothered to dust. Harland leaned back in his chair, his fingers steepled as he watched Nate and Voss settle into the chairs opposite him.

“I assume you’ve had time to... get acquainted,” Harland said, his tone carefully neutral.

Nate grunted. Voss, of course, remained silent.

“I’m going to be blunt,” Harland continued. “This task force is a big deal. If it works, it sets a precedent—not just for Midnight, but for every city still figuring out how to handle the integration.”

“Integration,” Nate said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. “Is that what we’re calling it now?”

Harland shot him a warning look. “You don’t have to like it, Cross. You just have to make it work.”

“And what exactly are we supposed to be working on?”

Harland slid a file across the desk. “A body was found in the North End two nights ago. At first glance, it looked like a standard homicide. But forensics found traces of a paralytic toxin in the victim’s blood—something that hasn’t been used since before vampires revealed themselves.”

Voss picked up the file, her expression unreadable as she flipped through it. “This toxin... you’re saying it’s vampiric in origin?”

“That’s what the lab thinks,” Harland said. “Which means this case falls squarely under your jurisdiction.”

Nate leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms. “Great. So we’re chasing a vampire killer. Just what I needed to round out my week.”

“Not just any vampire,” Harland said. “The kind that doesn’t play by the council’s rules. If this gets out, it’ll cause a shitstorm—not just for us, but for them, too.”

“So, damage control,” Voss said, her tone even.

“Exactly. Find whoever’s responsible and shut it down. Quietly.”

Nate glanced at Voss, then back at Harland. “And if it’s not quiet?”

“Then you’d better hope your new partner is as good as her file says she is,” Harland said, his gaze sharp.

They left the office in silence, the weight of the case pressing down on both of them. Back at his desk, Nate watched as Voss spread the crime scene photos across the surface, her focus razor-sharp.

“You don’t waste time, do you?” he muttered.

“Time isn’t a luxury we have,” she replied without looking up.

Nate sighed and leaned over, scanning the photos. The victim was a middle-aged man, his body pale and contorted. The puncture marks on his neck were faint, almost invisible, but they were there.

“You’re awfully calm about this,” Nate said, his voice low.

“This isn’t my first case,” she replied. “And it won’t be my last.”

“Yeah, well, don’t get too comfortable. Midnight has a way of chewing people up and spitting them out.”

She finally looked up, her green eyes meeting his. “Maybe. But I’m not like most people.”

Nate didn’t have a response to that, so he grabbed his coat and headed for the door. “Come on. Let’s see if the lab has anything new for us.”

The forensics lab was tucked away in the basement of the precinct, a stark contrast to the chaos of the bullpen. Nate always hated coming down here—the sterile smell, the harsh lighting, the constant hum of machines.

Dr. Marcus Webb was hunched over a microscope when they walked in, his graying hair sticking up in every direction. He looked up as they approached, his eyes lighting up when he saw Voss.

“Well, if it isn’t the infamous Evelyn Voss,” he said, standing and offering her a hand. “I’ve heard a lot about you.”

“All good things, I hope,” Voss said, shaking his hand.

“Mostly,” Webb said with a grin. “And you must be Cross. Heard you’re a pain in the ass.”

“Glad my reputation precedes me,” Nate said dryly.

Webb chuckled and gestured for them to follow him. “I’ve got something you’ll want to see.”

He led them to a workstation where a series of vials were lined up next to a computer.

“This,” he said, holding up one of the vials, “is what we found in the victim’s bloodstream. A paralytic toxin—potent, fast-acting, and almost undetectable.”

“Almost,” Voss said.

“Right. Whoever used this was careful, but not careful enough. I was able to isolate the compound, and it matches a substance that was popular among rogue vampires about fifty years ago.”

Nate frowned. “Fifty years? Why would anyone bring it back now?”

“That’s the million-dollar question,” Webb said. “But here’s the kicker—this version is more refined. Someone’s been perfecting it.”

Voss exchanged a glance with Nate. “Which means they’re planning to use it again.”

“Exactly,” Webb said. “And if they’re not stopped, you can bet the body count will climb.”

 

 

 

 

 

**Chapter 2**

The streets of Midnight carried a heavy silence at night, broken only by the occasional wail of a distant siren or the low hum of passing vehicles. Nate Cross walked ahead of Evelyn Voss, his coat billowing slightly in the cool breeze. He didn’t slow his pace, didn’t offer her the courtesy of a glance, but he knew she was there. The faint sound of her boots on the pavement was a constant reminder.

“Do you always walk like you’re trying to leave someone behind?” Voss asked.

Nate’s lip twitched in irritation, but he didn’t respond. He turned a corner sharply, heading toward the victim’s apartment. The area wasn’t the best—rows of dilapidated buildings with boarded-up windows and graffiti tagging nearly every surface. It was the kind of place where crimes went unsolved, and residents learned not to ask too many questions.

“You’ll get used to it,” Nate finally muttered.

“Get used to what?”

“Everything. The city. The people. The fact that you’re never really welcome.”

“Is that what you tell yourself?”

Nate stopped abruptly, spinning to face her. “Listen, Voss. I’m here because I have to be. You? You’re here because Harland thinks this little partnership is some kind of progressive PR stunt. You don’t belong here.”

She tilted her head slightly, her expression calm, infuriatingly composed. “I’ve been hearing that my entire life. You’ll have to try harder if you’re hoping to hurt my feelings.”

“Trust me, that’s not the goal,” Nate snapped, turning back around.

They climbed a narrow staircase in the victim’s apartment building, the air stale and carrying a faint metallic tang that Nate had come to associate with blood. He knocked twice on the door before pushing it open.

The apartment was a crime scene frozen in time. Blood spatter painted the walls, furniture overturned in what had clearly been a struggle. Voss entered behind him, her sharp eyes scanning the room.

“Do you always charge in without waiting for backup?” she asked, her tone light but tinged with something sharper.

“Backup’s a luxury we don’t have,” Nate replied.

Nate moved through the room with practiced ease, his eyes darting between the scattered evidence. He crouched near a coffee table that had been overturned, its legs splintered. A pool of dried blood had collected beneath it, dark and sticky, the coppery smell filling the air.

Voss remained by the doorway, watching him. “Anything stand out?”

He didn’t answer immediately, instead picking up a broken picture frame. The photograph inside was spattered with blood but still visible—a man in his late forties, smiling with a younger woman at what looked like a park. The kind of photo that didn’t belong in a scene like this.

Nate set it aside and stood, brushing his hands off on his coat. “Looks like a standard break-in gone wrong, except for the part where the perp used an illegal vampiric toxin.”

Voss stepped further into the room, her movements deliberate, almost predatory. She crouched near the bloodstain, her fingers hovering just above the floor. “This wasn’t random.”

“You can tell that just by looking at a bloodstain?”

She ignored his sarcasm, standing and pointing toward the far wall. “No signs of forced entry. Whoever did this was invited in.”

Nate frowned, following her gaze. The doorframe was intact, the lock undamaged. She was right—someone had let the killer in.

“Maybe the vic knew them,” he said, his voice quieter now. “Trusted them.”

“Or they didn’t have a choice.”

Her words hung in the air, heavy and undeniable. Nate felt the familiar weight of frustration creeping in, the same one he’d carried since this case began.

He turned abruptly, heading toward the bedroom. “Let’s see if there’s anything useful in here.”

The bedroom was small and sparsely furnished. A single bed sat against one wall, the covers rumpled as if someone had left in a hurry. A nightstand held a stack of books, a lamp, and a half-empty glass of water.

Nate rifled through the drawers while Voss examined the closet. It wasn’t long before she pulled something out—a small black case with a silver clasp.

“Found something,” she said, holding it up.

Nate crossed the room, taking the case from her. It was heavier than he expected, the metal cool against his skin. He popped the clasp, revealing a set of syringes filled with a faintly glowing liquid.

“The toxin,” Voss said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Nate’s jaw tightened. “Looks like our victim wasn’t as innocent as we thought.”

Nate set the case down on the bed and stared at it, his mind racing. The toxin wasn’t just illegal—it was dangerous, capable of paralyzing vampires and humans alike. The faint glow from the liquid made his stomach churn. He’d seen this before, years ago, in another case that ended with too many bodies.

Voss crossed her arms, watching his expression. “You’ve dealt with this before.”

“Not like this,” Nate replied, though his tone suggested otherwise. He snapped the case shut. “This changes everything. If the victim was involved with this, they weren’t just a target—they were part of something bigger.”

Voss raised an eyebrow. “Bigger, how?”

Nate didn’t answer immediately. He leaned against the wall, his gaze fixed on the case. “Back in the early days, when the city was still being built, there were whispers about this kind of stuff. Underground networks. Humans trying to ‘level the playing field.’” He scoffed. “Guess they thought it was a good idea to weaponize the thing they feared most.”

“Poetic,” Voss said dryly.

“More like suicidal.”

The sound of footsteps outside the apartment broke their conversation. Nate was on alert instantly, his hand instinctively going to his holstered weapon. Voss moved silently to the door, her head tilted as she listened.

The door creaked open, and a uniformed officer stepped inside. It was Davies, a rookie who always looked like he’d rather be anywhere else. He froze when he saw Voss, his hand hovering near his own weapon.

“It’s fine, Davies,” Nate said, lowering his gun. “She’s with me.”

The officer nodded stiffly but didn’t relax. “Chief wants an update,” he said, his voice cracking slightly.

Nate exchanged a glance with Voss before turning back to the rookie. “Tell him we’ve got a lead. I’ll fill him in when we’re back.”

Davies hesitated, his eyes darting between the two of them. Finally, he nodded and disappeared as quickly as he’d come.

“Friendly bunch,” Voss remarked, leaning against the doorframe.

Nate let out a humorless laugh. “You get used to it.”

Voss didn’t reply, but her expression softened just enough for Nate to notice.

The ride back to the precinct was suffocating. Nate drove in silence, his knuckles white against the steering wheel. Voss sat beside him, her hands folded neatly in her lap, her calm demeanor a stark contrast to the tension in the air. The rain tapped steadily against the windshield, blurring the neon lights of the city into streaks of color.

“You always this talkative?” Voss finally asked, her tone light but probing.

“Depends on the company,” Nate replied, his eyes fixed on the road.

“Let me guess,” she said, smirking. “The strong, silent type. Lone wolf. The guy who doesn’t play well with others.”

Nate tightened his grip on the wheel. “I’m here to do a job. Not make friends.”

“Right,” Voss said, leaning back in her seat. “Because being a martyr is so much more productive.”

Nate shot her a glare but said nothing.

The precinct loomed ahead, its stark, utilitarian architecture a sharp contrast to the chaotic vibrancy of the city around it. Nate pulled into the underground parking lot, cutting the engine with a sharp twist of the key.

“Welcome to paradise,” he muttered as they stepped out.

The precinct was alive with activity, officers bustling about, phones ringing, and the hum of conversations filling the air. Voss drew a few curious glances as she walked beside Nate, but most people avoided meeting her gaze.

“Stay close,” Nate said over his shoulder as he led her through the maze of desks and filing cabinets.

They reached Chief Harland’s office, the door slightly ajar. Nate knocked once before pushing it open.

Harland looked up from his desk, his eyes narrowing as they landed on Voss. He was a broad man with graying hair and a face that looked like it had seen too many late nights and bad decisions.

“Cross,” Harland said, his tone gruff. “You’ve got something for me?”

Nate dropped the black case onto the desk. “Toxin. Found it at the vic’s place. Looks like he was dealing.”

Harland frowned, opening the case and inspecting the contents. “This just got a whole lot messier.”

“No kidding,” Nate said.

Harland glanced at Voss. “And you’re... the new transfer?”

“Evelyn Voss,” she said, extending a hand.

Harland didn’t take it. Instead, he leaned back in his chair, his gaze sharp. “You’ve got a lot to prove, Voss. I don’t take risks lightly, and bringing you in? That’s a hell of a gamble.”

“I’m not here to disappoint,” she said, her voice steady.

“We’ll see,” Harland replied, closing the case. He turned his attention back to Nate. “You’re taking her with you. Like it or not, she’s part of this now.”

Nate’s jaw clenched. “Chief—”

“Not a discussion, Cross,” Harland said, cutting him off. “Get out there and figure this out before we’ve got more bodies on our hands.”

Nate stormed out of the office, his boots echoing against the linoleum floor. Voss followed, her heels clicking rhythmically behind him. The buzz of the precinct seemed louder now, officers darting past, conversations overlapping.

“Want to talk about it?” Voss asked, her tone irritatingly casual.

“No,” Nate snapped, weaving through the crowded space toward his desk.

“Good,” she said, unfazed. “Because I wasn’t really asking.”

He stopped abruptly, spinning to face her. “Listen, you might’ve impressed Harland, but that doesn’t mean I have to like it. Just stay out of my way and do what you’re told.”

Voss crossed her arms, her lips curving into a faint smirk. “You’ve got a funny way of saying ‘welcome aboard.’”

Before Nate could retort, a voice called out from across the room. “Cross! You got a sec?”

It was Jordan, one of the forensic techs. She was standing by her workstation, holding a tablet. Nate exhaled sharply and turned away from Voss without another word.

“What do you got?” Nate asked as he approached.

Jordan handed him the tablet, her brow furrowed. “Ran a preliminary on the toxin. It’s a modified version of something we’ve seen before—designed to work faster, hit harder.”

Nate scanned the data on the screen, his stomach sinking. “This isn’t street-level stuff.”

“No,” Jordan agreed. “Whoever made this knew what they were doing. This is high-end, military-grade, maybe even custom.”

Nate’s mind raced. The implications were worse than he’d thought. If this kind of toxin was making its way into the city, it wasn’t just about a few back-alley deals. This was organized, deliberate.

“You’re gonna love this part,” Jordan added, pulling up another screen. “The chemical markers? They match a batch confiscated a year ago. Guess where.”

Nate didn’t need to guess. The answer was already forming in his mind, unwelcome and unavoidable.

“Westgate,” he said grimly.

Jordan nodded. “Looks like someone’s picking up where they left off.”

Voss, who had been listening silently, stepped closer. “What’s Westgate?”

Nate hesitated, his jaw tightening. “An old case. Ended badly.”

“How badly?”

“Bodies in the morgue. Case closed. Or so we thought.”

Voss’s eyes narrowed. “And now it’s open again.”

“Seems that way,” Nate said, handing the tablet back to Jordan. “Thanks.”

Jordan gave him a sympathetic look before returning to her work.

Nate turned to Voss, his expression hard. “If you’re coming along, you’d better keep up. This isn’t gonna be pretty.”

“Wouldn’t dream of slowing you down,” she said, falling into step beside him.

The rain had slowed to a drizzle by the time they reached the car. Nate climbed in without a word, the tension between him and Voss as heavy as the humidity in the air. She slid into the passenger seat, her expression unreadable, and fastened her seatbelt with deliberate calm.

“Westgate,” she said after a moment, breaking the silence. “You’re going to have to tell me about it eventually.”

Nate started the engine, his jaw tightening. “Not now.”

Voss didn’t push further, though the curiosity lingered in her eyes.

The drive took them toward the older part of the city, where the gleaming skyscrapers gave way to crumbling brick facades and narrow, uneven streets. This was Midnight’s underbelly, where neon signs flickered and shadows lingered long after sundown.

They parked outside a dilapidated warehouse, the kind of place that screamed “illegal activity.” Nate killed the engine and checked his weapon.

“Stay close,” he said, stepping out into the damp night air.

Voss followed, her boots crunching softly against the gravel. “You say that like I’m planning to wander off.”

They approached the warehouse cautiously, the scent of mildew and rust heavy in the air. The large metal doors were slightly ajar, creaking with each gust of wind. Nate signaled for Voss to stay back as he pushed the door open, his gun drawn.

Inside, the air was thick with the stench of decay. The faint glow of a single hanging bulb cast long, distorted shadows across the cluttered space.

“Smell that?” Voss whispered, wrinkling her nose.

“Yeah,” Nate replied grimly, moving deeper into the room.

The source of the smell became apparent quickly. A body lay slumped against a stack of crates, its features twisted in a rictus of agony. The flesh was discolored, the veins stark against the pallid skin.

“Second victim,” Voss murmured, crouching beside the body.

Nate nodded, scanning the room for any signs of movement. “Same toxin?”

“Looks like it,” she said, her gloved hand hovering over the corpse. “But this one wasn’t just exposed. This was... concentrated.”

Nate’s stomach turned. He’d seen enough death to be numb to it, but there was something about this that felt different. Targeted.

A sound echoed from deeper within the warehouse—a faint scrape of metal against concrete. Nate froze, his gun trained on the direction of the noise.

“Stay here,” he hissed to Voss, moving toward the sound.

She ignored him, following at a distance, her own weapon drawn.

The noise led them to a back room, the door slightly ajar. Nate pushed it open cautiously, revealing a makeshift lab. Tables were strewn with glass vials, burners, and handwritten notes. The air was sharp with the tang of chemicals.

“Jackpot,” Voss said quietly, stepping inside.

“Or a trap,” Nate muttered, his eyes scanning every corner of the room.

A sudden movement to his left made him spin, his gun snapping up. A figure darted past, quick and shadowy.

“Stop!” Nate shouted, giving chase.

The figure bolted toward the rear exit, crashing through the door and into the rain-soaked alley. Nate was on their heels, his breath coming in sharp bursts.

“Voss, cut them off!” he barked over his shoulder.

She veered to the side, taking a parallel route through the maze of alleys. The figure stumbled, their foot catching on a loose brick, and Nate closed the distance, tackling them to the ground.

They struggled violently, clawing and kicking, but Nate pinned them down, twisting their arm behind their back.

“Who sent you?” he demanded, his voice cold and sharp.

The figure—a gaunt, nervous-looking man—gasped for breath, his eyes wide with fear. “I-I don’t know! I’m just a runner!”

“Bullshit,” Nate growled, pressing harder. “Talk.”

The man whimpered, shaking his head. “Please! I just deliver! That’s all!”

Voss appeared at the end of the alley, her gun trained on the man. “He’s telling the truth, Cross. Look at him—he’s nobody.”

Nate hesitated, his grip loosening slightly. “Who do you deliver to?”

The man swallowed hard, his voice barely above a whisper. “The Hollowkin.”

Got it! I’ll incorporate the suggested changes moving forward, ensuring Nate's inner conflict, Westgate's significance, and the Hollowkin reveal are given more detail and depth. Let’s pick up from where we left off, keeping the style detailed and immersive.

The man trembled beneath Nate's grip, his breath hitching as he stared at the barrel of Voss's gun. Rainwater mixed with the grime on his face, making him look ghostly pale under the dim streetlight.

“Hollowkin?” Voss’s voice cut through the tension like a blade. She didn’t lower her weapon. “That’s not a name you throw around lightly. Who are they?”

The man swallowed hard, his Adam's apple bobbing. “I—I don’t know much, I swear. They don’t deal with people like me. I just deliver packages, messages. That’s it!”

“Messages to who?” Nate demanded, tightening his grip on the man’s arm. His knuckles whitened, the frustration bubbling to the surface. “Who’s running this show?”

The man whimpered. “I don’t know! They’re... They’re like shadows. You don’t see them unless they want you to.”

Voss exchanged a glance with Nate, her expression unreadable. “You expect us to believe that?” she asked, her tone cold.

“I swear!” the man cried. “They’ll kill me just for saying the name! Please, let me go!”

Nate leaned in closer, his voice a low growl. “If you think they’re scary, you’ve never met me.”

The man’s breath quickened, and for a moment, Nate thought he might pass out. He loosened his grip slightly, just enough to let him speak.

“They’re monsters,” the man whispered. “Real monsters. Not like the vamps you’re used to. They don’t just change their faces; they change... everything.”

Nate’s stomach tightened. The man’s words tugged at something buried deep in his memory, something he’d tried to forget. Westgate.

“What do you mean by everything?” Voss pressed, her tone more urgent now.

The man shook his head, tears streaming down his face. “I’ve said too much. They’ll find me. They’ll kill me.”

Nate let out a frustrated sigh and pulled the man to his feet. “You’re coming with us. Maybe some time in a cell will jog your memory.”

“No!” the man shouted, struggling against Nate’s grip. “You don’t understand! They’re everywhere!”

A sudden, sharp crack echoed through the alley. The man stiffened, his eyes going wide, before crumpling to the ground. Blood pooled beneath him, mixing with the rainwater.

“Sniper!” Voss shouted, pulling Nate behind the nearest dumpster.

Nate cursed under his breath, drawing his gun and scanning the rooftops. The alley was a maze of shadows and angles, the perfect hunting ground for a marksman.

“Do you see them?” Voss asked, her back pressed against the metal bin.

“No,” Nate growled. “Stay low.”

They moved cautiously, sticking to the cover provided by dumpsters and crates. The rain picked up again, the sound of droplets masking any movement above.

Nate’s mind raced. Whoever these Hollowkin were, they had resources—and no qualms about cleaning up loose ends.

When they reached the end of the alley, Nate motioned for Voss to stop. He peered around the corner, his heart pounding. The street beyond was deserted, the flickering neon sign of a convenience store casting eerie reflections on the wet pavement.

“They’re gone,” he muttered, lowering his weapon.

Voss let out a shaky breath, her fingers still clutching her gun. “That was too clean. They were waiting for us.”

Nate nodded, his jaw clenched. “Which means we’re onto something.”

They stood there for a moment, the rain soaking through their clothes. Finally, Voss broke the silence.

“So,” she said, her voice quieter now. “Are you going to tell me what’s going on? Or do I have to guess?”

Nate glanced at her, his expression hard. “Not here. Let’s get back to the precinct.”",1,1736360478.0,WritersGroup,0,1.0,False
1hwqyv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleepwalkingstories/comments/1hwqyv2/the_sandwich_incident/,The Sandwich Incident,"This took place 3-4 years ago when I was still married. My ex wife had a portion of this on video so I know she wasn't making this up. 

I had a long day at work so I got home and pretty much went straight to bed. Around 11:30 according to my ex wife I got up and was just kind of wondering around. I ended up in the kitchen after a short stroll through the house. 

Apparently I just started taking stuff out of the fridge and putting it on the counter. At this point my ex gets up to see what I'm doing. After not respond to her she walks up and realizes I'm sleep walking. She had always heard it's bad to wake someone up so she left me alone and just watched to make sure I didn't do anything dangerous. 

I went and got the bread (skipped a plate) and started assembling a sandwich with random things from the fridge. Everything from leftover spaghetti to hard boiled eggs went on there. By the time I was done it was 3-4 inches thick. 

I put everything away (accept for the pickels for some reason) and proceed to pick up the sandwich and put it in the over. Just plopped it rite on the top rack. Closed the over and just walked away and went back to bed.

My ex took the sandwich out, plated it, and put it in the fridge to show me my creation the next morning. I was off work the next day so I slept in a little bit but when I woke up she was in the living room with the grin on her face. I head to the kitchen for coffee and she comes in allready laughing and tells me to look in the fridge. 

I was shocked at how big and perfect this sandwich was put together. I let her tell me what happened and of course I grabbed a knife so I could cut the sandwich in half and try it. 

On a scale of 1-10 that sandwich was a solid 9. The combination of all the random things actually worked somewhat well together and the only reason it doesn't get a 10 is because it was a little dry and cold. ",4,1736360478.0,sleepwalkingstories,1,1.0,False

Since 1 year I started losing hair, my doctor (with a cursory visit) diagnosed me with AGA and prescribed fin+min. I suffered a lot because I was the only one in the family and among my peers (20 years old) who was losing hair and I already had visibly less (hairline is still good, but lost almost 50% of the volume). Despite this, I reluctantly decided to give up the treatments, scared of the side effects. I tried natural remedies such as oils, and they were working on the regrowth, with the appearance of several baby hairs.... but the fall... oh fall... I lost up to 200 hairs every shower, so much so that I unconsciously avoided it so as not to lose more hair. 1 month ago I gave up oils and every type of treatment. I decided to try avoiding dairy products and coffee and use shampoos suitable for my extremely oily scalp. The first 2 weeks I didn't notice any differences. but from one day to the next... i'm not losing hair anymore. maybe it's just stabilized, maybe the caffeine has nothing to do with it... but you can rest assured that i won't drink coffee anymore. i repeat once again that i'm not a doctor and this is just the result of my personal experience (not having any bald people in my family, it seemed very strange to me to have AGA). what i would like to tell you guys is to try, try not taking caffeine and limiting dairy products a lot for a couple of weeks, it's worth the effort (if it doesn't work you will at least have saved a little!)

**Chapter 1: Midnight Shadows**

The rain was relentless, hammering down on the City of Midnight as if trying to wash away its sins. Nathaniel Cross sat in his dimly lit office at the precinct, the scent of stale coffee and damp leather clinging to the air. His desk was cluttered with case files and half-finished paperwork, a chaotic reflection of the man himself.

Outside his window, the city flickered with neon lights that barely pierced the gloom. Midnight was supposed to be a fresh start, a place where vampires and humans could coexist after centuries of bloodshed. Instead, it was a powder keg waiting for a spark.

Nate scowled as he flipped through the latest case file. Clare Sutton, 22, gone without a trace. The photo stapled to the corner showed a young woman with bright eyes and a hopeful smile—a face full of life that would likely end up drained and lifeless in a back alley somewhere. Missing persons weren’t uncommon in Midnight, but they were rarely solved.

He set the file down and rubbed his temples. His head throbbed, a dull ache that never seemed to go away. He’d been working this job too long, and the city was eating him alive. But quitting wasn’t an option—not for someone like him.

A sharp knock on the glass pane of his office door pulled him from his thoughts. He looked up to see Chief Harland, his broad shoulders filling the doorway. The man had a face carved from stone, with deep lines that spoke of too many sleepless nights and too many compromises.

“Cross. My office. Now.”

Nate sighed, grabbing his coat as he stood. “What now?” he muttered under his breath.

Chief Harland’s office was no sanctuary. It was as grim and utilitarian as the rest of the precinct, with filing cabinets threatening to burst and the faint smell of cigar smoke hanging in the air. The only personal touch was a faded photograph of Harland and his family, taken long before the city had claimed him.

“Sit,” Harland said, gesturing to the chair opposite his desk.

Nate slumped into the seat, his posture radiating reluctance. “What’s this about?”

Harland slid a folder across the desk, the tab labeled *Evelyn Voss*. Nate’s eyes narrowed as he picked it up.

“A new assignment,” Harland said. “And a new partner.”

Nate froze. His jaw tightened, and he threw the folder back onto the desk without opening it. “Not interested.”

Harland’s expression didn’t change. “It’s not a request. This comes from higher up.”

“I don’t do partners.”

“You do now. There’s a task force being formed. Off the books, high priority. You’re leading it, and Voss is your second.”

Nate shook his head. “No way. I’m not babysitting some rookie.”

Harland leaned forward, his voice dropping to a low rumble. “Voss isn’t a rookie. She’s one of the best we’ve got. Sharp, efficient, and experienced in fieldwork. You’ll need her.”

Nate snorted. “She’s a vampire.”

“And she’s better at this job than half the humans in this precinct. You don’t have to like her, Cross, but you will work with her. That’s an order.”

Nate stood, his fists clenched at his sides. “You can’t expect me to trust her—not after what they did.”

Harland’s gaze softened, but his tone remained firm. “I know what happened. But this isn’t about your past—it’s about this city’s future. We’re hanging by a thread, and you’re one of the few people keeping it together.”

For a long moment, Nate didn’t move. Then, with a sharp nod, he turned and stalked out of the office.

The bullpen was alive with noise, a constant hum of voices and the sharp clatter of keyboards. Nate strode through it like a storm cloud, his scowl enough to part the crowd. He didn’t need to look to know that eyes were on him. Half the precinct probably already knew about this new assignment, and the other half would by the end of the day.

He reached his desk and dropped into his chair, rubbing a hand over his face. The folder Harland had given him sat in his lap, unopened. He didn’t need to read it. He’d seen enough vampires in his time to know what kind of person he was dealing with. They all had that same air of superiority, that barely concealed hunger in their eyes.

“Cross?”

The voice was sharp, clipped, and entirely too close. Nate looked up to see a woman standing at the edge of his desk. She was tall, her black suit perfectly tailored, and her green eyes locked onto his with an intensity that was unsettling. Evelyn Voss. She didn’t look like the vampires Nate was used to dealing with—no gothic flair or predatory smirk. Just a cold, calculated professionalism that somehow felt worse.

“You must be Voss,” he said, leaning back in his chair. His tone was laced with disdain. “Nice to see Harland wasn’t exaggerating.”

“And you must be Nathaniel Cross,” she replied. Her voice was smooth, with just a hint of an accent Nate couldn’t place. “I’ve heard... mixed reviews.”

He smirked. “Let me guess—too angry, too stubborn, doesn’t play well with others?”

Her expression didn’t change. “Something like that.”

Nate gestured to the empty chair across from his desk. “Well, if we’re going to be stuck together, you might as well sit down.”

She hesitated, just for a moment, before taking the seat. Her movements were precise, controlled, like she was always calculating her next move. Nate hated it.

“Let’s get one thing straight,” he said, leaning forward. “I don’t trust you. I don’t like you. And I sure as hell don’t want you on my team. But Harland seems to think you’re worth something, so I’ll give you a chance. One chance. Don’t screw it up.”

Her lips twitched, the closest thing to a smile he’d seen. “Noted.”

The tension between them was palpable, drawing the attention of a few nearby officers. Nate ignored them, focusing instead on the case file in front of him. He didn’t care how good Voss was supposed to be. As far as he was concerned, this partnership was doomed from the start.

Voss didn’t say much after that, content to let the awkward silence fill the space between them. Nate worked through the case file, flipping through pages with more force than necessary. He could feel her watching him, studying him, and it grated on his nerves.

“You’re staring,” he muttered without looking up.

“I’m assessing,” she corrected. “You have a reputation, Cross. It’s... interesting to see if you live up to it.”

“And what’s the verdict so far?”

She tilted her head slightly, her green eyes narrowing. “You’re angry. Very angry. But you’re also methodical. Even when you’re pissed, you’re thorough. That’s rare.”

Nate snorted. “Spare me the psychoanalysis. I’m not one of your case studies.”

“I wasn’t aware I needed your permission to form an opinion,” she said smoothly.

He slammed the file shut, the sharp sound drawing a few glances from nearby desks. “Look, Voss, if you think this little task force is going to be some bonding exercise, you’re in for a rude awakening. We’re not friends. We’re not partners. We’re two people forced into the same corner.”

“Understood,” she said, her tone so neutral it made his teeth grind.

Nate stood abruptly, grabbing his coat. “I need some air.”

He stalked toward the exit, leaving Voss sitting there. He needed space, distance, something to clear his head before he said something he couldn’t take back.

Outside, the rain had slowed to a drizzle, the streets shimmering under the dim glow of streetlights. Midnight never really slept; there was always movement, always noise. Nate lit a cigarette, taking a long drag as he leaned against the precinct’s brick wall.

The memories hit him before he could push them back, creeping into his mind like a cold fog.

It was a night much like this one, years ago, before Midnight had even been conceived. He’d been a different man then—idealistic, hopeful, stupid.

They’d been called to a small town on the outskirts of nowhere. Reports of strange disappearances, livestock slaughtered, families vanishing. Vampires, though the word hadn’t been spoken out loud. Back then, most people didn’t believe in them. Nate had been one of them.

The first body they found was a boy, no older than ten. His throat had been torn out, his skin pale as snow. The house was empty, the rest of the family missing, but the bloodstains told a clear story. They hadn’t gone quietly.

They followed the trail to a farmhouse on the edge of town. The windows were boarded up, the air thick with the stench of death. Nate had gone in first, his partner close behind. What they found inside still haunted his nightmares.

Bodies, dozens of them, strung up like cattle in a slaughterhouse. The blood had been drained from them, collected in barrels that lined the walls. And in the center of it all was a vampire—a woman with eyes like molten gold and a smile that chilled his soul.

She’d killed his partner before he could blink, moving faster than anything he’d ever seen. Nate had barely gotten a shot off before she was on him, her claws ripping through his flesh like paper. He’d thought he was going to die that night, but somehow, he’d survived. The scars on his chest were a constant reminder of how close he’d come.

The memory faded as his cigarette burned down to the filter. Nate crushed it under his heel, his hands shaking. He hated them—every single one of them. And now he was supposed to work with one? It was almost laughable.

He heard the door open behind him and turned to see Voss stepping out, her expression unreadable. She didn’t say anything, just stood there, watching him.

“Didn’t take you for a smoker,” he said, his voice rough.

“I’m not. But you seemed... agitated.”

Nate laughed bitterly. “That’s one word for it.”

She hesitated, then stepped closer. “I know this isn’t easy for you. It’s not easy for me, either. But we don’t have to like each other to do the job.”

“Is that supposed to be some kind of pep talk?”

“It’s reality,” she said. “You don’t trust me, and I get that. But we’re on the same side, whether you believe it or not.”

Nate studied her for a long moment, searching for any hint of insincerity. He didn’t find any.

“Fine,” he said finally. “Let’s get one thing straight, though. You screw up, and I won’t hesitate to call you out. Got it?”

“Crystal clear,” she said, her lips quirking into a faint smile.

He didn’t return it.

The next few days were tense, the kind of tension that settled in the pit of Nate’s stomach and refused to let go. Voss moved through the precinct like she belonged there, her sharp eyes taking in everything and everyone. Nate hated how composed she always seemed, like nothing could touch her.

He, on the other hand, felt like he was unraveling. Every sideways glance from his colleagues, every muttered comment about “working with one of them,” only added to the weight on his shoulders. He didn’t want this, didn’t ask for it, but now it was his cross to bear.

By the third day, Harland called them into his office.

The chief’s office was cluttered, the walls lined with old case files and commendations that no one bothered to dust. Harland leaned back in his chair, his fingers steepled as he watched Nate and Voss settle into the chairs opposite him.

“I assume you’ve had time to... get acquainted,” Harland said, his tone carefully neutral.

Nate grunted. Voss, of course, remained silent.

“I’m going to be blunt,” Harland continued. “This task force is a big deal. If it works, it sets a precedent—not just for Midnight, but for every city still figuring out how to handle the integration.”

“Integration,” Nate said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. “Is that what we’re calling it now?”

Harland shot him a warning look. “You don’t have to like it, Cross. You just have to make it work.”

“And what exactly are we supposed to be working on?”

Harland slid a file across the desk. “A body was found in the North End two nights ago. At first glance, it looked like a standard homicide. But forensics found traces of a paralytic toxin in the victim’s blood—something that hasn’t been used since before vampires revealed themselves.”

Voss picked up the file, her expression unreadable as she flipped through it. “This toxin... you’re saying it’s vampiric in origin?”

“That’s what the lab thinks,” Harland said. “Which means this case falls squarely under your jurisdiction.”

Nate leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms. “Great. So we’re chasing a vampire killer. Just what I needed to round out my week.”

“Not just any vampire,” Harland said. “The kind that doesn’t play by the council’s rules. If this gets out, it’ll cause a shitstorm—not just for us, but for them, too.”

“So, damage control,” Voss said, her tone even.

“Exactly. Find whoever’s responsible and shut it down. Quietly.”

Nate glanced at Voss, then back at Harland. “And if it’s not quiet?”

“Then you’d better hope your new partner is as good as her file says she is,” Harland said, his gaze sharp.

They left the office in silence, the weight of the case pressing down on both of them. Back at his desk, Nate watched as Voss spread the crime scene photos across the surface, her focus razor-sharp.

“You don’t waste time, do you?” he muttered.

“Time isn’t a luxury we have,” she replied without looking up.

Nate sighed and leaned over, scanning the photos. The victim was a middle-aged man, his body pale and contorted. The puncture marks on his neck were faint, almost invisible, but they were there.

“You’re awfully calm about this,” Nate said, his voice low.

“This isn’t my first case,” she replied. “And it won’t be my last.”

“Yeah, well, don’t get too comfortable. Midnight has a way of chewing people up and spitting them out.”

She finally looked up, her green eyes meeting his. “Maybe. But I’m not like most people.”

Nate didn’t have a response to that, so he grabbed his coat and headed for the door. “Come on. Let’s see if the lab has anything new for us.”

The forensics lab was tucked away in the basement of the precinct, a stark contrast to the chaos of the bullpen. Nate always hated coming down here—the sterile smell, the harsh lighting, the constant hum of machines.

Dr. Marcus Webb was hunched over a microscope when they walked in, his graying hair sticking up in every direction. He looked up as they approached, his eyes lighting up when he saw Voss.

“Well, if it isn’t the infamous Evelyn Voss,” he said, standing and offering her a hand. “I’ve heard a lot about you.”

“All good things, I hope,” Voss said, shaking his hand.

“Mostly,” Webb said with a grin. “And you must be Cross. Heard you’re a pain in the ass.”

“Glad my reputation precedes me,” Nate said dryly.

Webb chuckled and gestured for them to follow him. “I’ve got something you’ll want to see.”

He led them to a workstation where a series of vials were lined up next to a computer.

“This,” he said, holding up one of the vials, “is what we found in the victim’s bloodstream. A paralytic toxin—potent, fast-acting, and almost undetectable.”

“Almost,” Voss said.

“Right. Whoever used this was careful, but not careful enough. I was able to isolate the compound, and it matches a substance that was popular among rogue vampires about fifty years ago.”

Nate frowned. “Fifty years? Why would anyone bring it back now?”

“That’s the million-dollar question,” Webb said. “But here’s the kicker—this version is more refined. Someone’s been perfecting it.”

Voss exchanged a glance with Nate. “Which means they’re planning to use it again.”

“Exactly,” Webb said. “And if they’re not stopped, you can bet the body count will climb.”

 

 

 

 

 

**Chapter 2**

The streets of Midnight carried a heavy silence at night, broken only by the occasional wail of a distant siren or the low hum of passing vehicles. Nate Cross walked ahead of Evelyn Voss, his coat billowing slightly in the cool breeze. He didn’t slow his pace, didn’t offer her the courtesy of a glance, but he knew she was there. The faint sound of her boots on the pavement was a constant reminder.

“Do you always walk like you’re trying to leave someone behind?” Voss asked.

Nate’s lip twitched in irritation, but he didn’t respond. He turned a corner sharply, heading toward the victim’s apartment. The area wasn’t the best—rows of dilapidated buildings with boarded-up windows and graffiti tagging nearly every surface. It was the kind of place where crimes went unsolved, and residents learned not to ask too many questions.

“You’ll get used to it,” Nate finally muttered.

“Get used to what?”

“Everything. The city. The people. The fact that you’re never really welcome.”

“Is that what you tell yourself?”

Nate stopped abruptly, spinning to face her. “Listen, Voss. I’m here because I have to be. You? You’re here because Harland thinks this little partnership is some kind of progressive PR stunt. You don’t belong here.”

She tilted her head slightly, her expression calm, infuriatingly composed. “I’ve been hearing that my entire life. You’ll have to try harder if you’re hoping to hurt my feelings.”

“Trust me, that’s not the goal,” Nate snapped, turning back around.

They climbed a narrow staircase in the victim’s apartment building, the air stale and carrying a faint metallic tang that Nate had come to associate with blood. He knocked twice on the door before pushing it open.

The apartment was a crime scene frozen in time. Blood spatter painted the walls, furniture overturned in what had clearly been a struggle. Voss entered behind him, her sharp eyes scanning the room.

“Do you always charge in without waiting for backup?” she asked, her tone light but tinged with something sharper.

“Backup’s a luxury we don’t have,” Nate replied.

Nate moved through the room with practiced ease, his eyes darting between the scattered evidence. He crouched near a coffee table that had been overturned, its legs splintered. A pool of dried blood had collected beneath it, dark and sticky, the coppery smell filling the air.

Voss remained by the doorway, watching him. “Anything stand out?”

He didn’t answer immediately, instead picking up a broken picture frame. The photograph inside was spattered with blood but still visible—a man in his late forties, smiling with a younger woman at what looked like a park. The kind of photo that didn’t belong in a scene like this.

Nate set it aside and stood, brushing his hands off on his coat. “Looks like a standard break-in gone wrong, except for the part where the perp used an illegal vampiric toxin.”

Voss stepped further into the room, her movements deliberate, almost predatory. She crouched near the bloodstain, her fingers hovering just above the floor. “This wasn’t random.”

“You can tell that just by looking at a bloodstain?”

She ignored his sarcasm, standing and pointing toward the far wall. “No signs of forced entry. Whoever did this was invited in.”

Nate frowned, following her gaze. The doorframe was intact, the lock undamaged. She was right—someone had let the killer in.

“Maybe the vic knew them,” he said, his voice quieter now. “Trusted them.”

“Or they didn’t have a choice.”

Her words hung in the air, heavy and undeniable. Nate felt the familiar weight of frustration creeping in, the same one he’d carried since this case began.

He turned abruptly, heading toward the bedroom. “Let’s see if there’s anything useful in here.”

The bedroom was small and sparsely furnished. A single bed sat against one wall, the covers rumpled as if someone had left in a hurry. A nightstand held a stack of books, a lamp, and a half-empty glass of water.

Nate rifled through the drawers while Voss examined the closet. It wasn’t long before she pulled something out—a small black case with a silver clasp.

“Found something,” she said, holding it up.

Nate crossed the room, taking the case from her. It was heavier than he expected, the metal cool against his skin. He popped the clasp, revealing a set of syringes filled with a faintly glowing liquid.

“The toxin,” Voss said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Nate’s jaw tightened. “Looks like our victim wasn’t as innocent as we thought.”

Nate set the case down on the bed and stared at it, his mind racing. The toxin wasn’t just illegal—it was dangerous, capable of paralyzing vampires and humans alike. The faint glow from the liquid made his stomach churn. He’d seen this before, years ago, in another case that ended with too many bodies.

Voss crossed her arms, watching his expression. “You’ve dealt with this before.”

“Not like this,” Nate replied, though his tone suggested otherwise. He snapped the case shut. “This changes everything. If the victim was involved with this, they weren’t just a target—they were part of something bigger.”

Voss raised an eyebrow. “Bigger, how?”

Nate didn’t answer immediately. He leaned against the wall, his gaze fixed on the case. “Back in the early days, when the city was still being built, there were whispers about this kind of stuff. Underground networks. Humans trying to ‘level the playing field.’” He scoffed. “Guess they thought it was a good idea to weaponize the thing they feared most.”

“Poetic,” Voss said dryly.

“More like suicidal.”

The sound of footsteps outside the apartment broke their conversation. Nate was on alert instantly, his hand instinctively going to his holstered weapon. Voss moved silently to the door, her head tilted as she listened.

The door creaked open, and a uniformed officer stepped inside. It was Davies, a rookie who always looked like he’d rather be anywhere else. He froze when he saw Voss, his hand hovering near his own weapon.

“It’s fine, Davies,” Nate said, lowering his gun. “She’s with me.”

The officer nodded stiffly but didn’t relax. “Chief wants an update,” he said, his voice cracking slightly.

Nate exchanged a glance with Voss before turning back to the rookie. “Tell him we’ve got a lead. I’ll fill him in when we’re back.”

Davies hesitated, his eyes darting between the two of them. Finally, he nodded and disappeared as quickly as he’d come.

“Friendly bunch,” Voss remarked, leaning against the doorframe.

Nate let out a humorless laugh. “You get used to it.”

Voss didn’t reply, but her expression softened just enough for Nate to notice.

The ride back to the precinct was suffocating. Nate drove in silence, his knuckles white against the steering wheel. Voss sat beside him, her hands folded neatly in her lap, her calm demeanor a stark contrast to the tension in the air. The rain tapped steadily against the windshield, blurring the neon lights of the city into streaks of color.

“You always this talkative?” Voss finally asked, her tone light but probing.

“Depends on the company,” Nate replied, his eyes fixed on the road.

“Let me guess,” she said, smirking. “The strong, silent type. Lone wolf. The guy who doesn’t play well with others.”

Nate tightened his grip on the wheel. “I’m here to do a job. Not make friends.”

“Right,” Voss said, leaning back in her seat. “Because being a martyr is so much more productive.”

Nate shot her a glare but said nothing.

The precinct loomed ahead, its stark, utilitarian architecture a sharp contrast to the chaotic vibrancy of the city around it. Nate pulled into the underground parking lot, cutting the engine with a sharp twist of the key.

“Welcome to paradise,” he muttered as they stepped out.

The precinct was alive with activity, officers bustling about, phones ringing, and the hum of conversations filling the air. Voss drew a few curious glances as she walked beside Nate, but most people avoided meeting her gaze.

“Stay close,” Nate said over his shoulder as he led her through the maze of desks and filing cabinets.

They reached Chief Harland’s office, the door slightly ajar. Nate knocked once before pushing it open.

Harland looked up from his desk, his eyes narrowing as they landed on Voss. He was a broad man with graying hair and a face that looked like it had seen too many late nights and bad decisions.

“Cross,” Harland said, his tone gruff. “You’ve got something for me?”

Nate dropped the black case onto the desk. “Toxin. Found it at the vic’s place. Looks like he was dealing.”

Harland frowned, opening the case and inspecting the contents. “This just got a whole lot messier.”

“No kidding,” Nate said.

Harland glanced at Voss. “And you’re... the new transfer?”

“Evelyn Voss,” she said, extending a hand.

Harland didn’t take it. Instead, he leaned back in his chair, his gaze sharp. “You’ve got a lot to prove, Voss. I don’t take risks lightly, and bringing you in? That’s a hell of a gamble.”

“I’m not here to disappoint,” she said, her voice steady.

“We’ll see,” Harland replied, closing the case. He turned his attention back to Nate. “You’re taking her with you. Like it or not, she’s part of this now.”

Nate’s jaw clenched. “Chief—”

“Not a discussion, Cross,” Harland said, cutting him off. “Get out there and figure this out before we’ve got more bodies on our hands.”

Nate stormed out of the office, his boots echoing against the linoleum floor. Voss followed, her heels clicking rhythmically behind him. The buzz of the precinct seemed louder now, officers darting past, conversations overlapping.

“Want to talk about it?” Voss asked, her tone irritatingly casual.

“No,” Nate snapped, weaving through the crowded space toward his desk.

“Good,” she said, unfazed. “Because I wasn’t really asking.”

He stopped abruptly, spinning to face her. “Listen, you might’ve impressed Harland, but that doesn’t mean I have to like it. Just stay out of my way and do what you’re told.”

Voss crossed her arms, her lips curving into a faint smirk. “You’ve got a funny way of saying ‘welcome aboard.’”

Before Nate could retort, a voice called out from across the room. “Cross! You got a sec?”

It was Jordan, one of the forensic techs. She was standing by her workstation, holding a tablet. Nate exhaled sharply and turned away from Voss without another word.

“What do you got?” Nate asked as he approached.

Jordan handed him the tablet, her brow furrowed. “Ran a preliminary on the toxin. It’s a modified version of something we’ve seen before—designed to work faster, hit harder.”

Nate scanned the data on the screen, his stomach sinking. “This isn’t street-level stuff.”

“No,” Jordan agreed. “Whoever made this knew what they were doing. This is high-end, military-grade, maybe even custom.”

Nate’s mind raced. The implications were worse than he’d thought. If this kind of toxin was making its way into the city, it wasn’t just about a few back-alley deals. This was organized, deliberate.

“You’re gonna love this part,” Jordan added, pulling up another screen. “The chemical markers? They match a batch confiscated a year ago. Guess where.”

Nate didn’t need to guess. The answer was already forming in his mind, unwelcome and unavoidable.

“Westgate,” he said grimly.

Jordan nodded. “Looks like someone’s picking up where they left off.”

Voss, who had been listening silently, stepped closer. “What’s Westgate?”

Nate hesitated, his jaw tightening. “An old case. Ended badly.”

“How badly?”

“Bodies in the morgue. Case closed. Or so we thought.”

Voss’s eyes narrowed. “And now it’s open again.”

“Seems that way,” Nate said, handing the tablet back to Jordan. “Thanks.”

Jordan gave him a sympathetic look before returning to her work.

Nate turned to Voss, his expression hard. “If you’re coming along, you’d better keep up. This isn’t gonna be pretty.”

“Wouldn’t dream of slowing you down,” she said, falling into step beside him.

The rain had slowed to a drizzle by the time they reached the car. Nate climbed in without a word, the tension between him and Voss as heavy as the humidity in the air. She slid into the passenger seat, her expression unreadable, and fastened her seatbelt with deliberate calm.

“Westgate,” she said after a moment, breaking the silence. “You’re going to have to tell me about it eventually.”

Nate started the engine, his jaw tightening. “Not now.”

Voss didn’t push further, though the curiosity lingered in her eyes.

The drive took them toward the older part of the city, where the gleaming skyscrapers gave way to crumbling brick facades and narrow, uneven streets. This was Midnight’s underbelly, where neon signs flickered and shadows lingered long after sundown.

They parked outside a dilapidated warehouse, the kind of place that screamed “illegal activity.” Nate killed the engine and checked his weapon.

“Stay close,” he said, stepping out into the damp night air.

Voss followed, her boots crunching softly against the gravel. “You say that like I’m planning to wander off.”

They approached the warehouse cautiously, the scent of mildew and rust heavy in the air. The large metal doors were slightly ajar, creaking with each gust of wind. Nate signaled for Voss to stay back as he pushed the door open, his gun drawn.

Inside, the air was thick with the stench of decay. The faint glow of a single hanging bulb cast long, distorted shadows across the cluttered space.

“Smell that?” Voss whispered, wrinkling her nose.

“Yeah,” Nate replied grimly, moving deeper into the room.

The source of the smell became apparent quickly. A body lay slumped against a stack of crates, its features twisted in a rictus of agony. The flesh was discolored, the veins stark against the pallid skin.

“Second victim,” Voss murmured, crouching beside the body.

Nate nodded, scanning the room for any signs of movement. “Same toxin?”

“Looks like it,” she said, her gloved hand hovering over the corpse. “But this one wasn’t just exposed. This was... concentrated.”

Nate’s stomach turned. He’d seen enough death to be numb to it, but there was something about this that felt different. Targeted.

A sound echoed from deeper within the warehouse—a faint scrape of metal against concrete. Nate froze, his gun trained on the direction of the noise.

“Stay here,” he hissed to Voss, moving toward the sound.

She ignored him, following at a distance, her own weapon drawn.

The noise led them to a back room, the door slightly ajar. Nate pushed it open cautiously, revealing a makeshift lab. Tables were strewn with glass vials, burners, and handwritten notes. The air was sharp with the tang of chemicals.

“Jackpot,” Voss said quietly, stepping inside.

“Or a trap,” Nate muttered, his eyes scanning every corner of the room.

A sudden movement to his left made him spin, his gun snapping up. A figure darted past, quick and shadowy.

“Stop!” Nate shouted, giving chase.

The figure bolted toward the rear exit, crashing through the door and into the rain-soaked alley. Nate was on their heels, his breath coming in sharp bursts.

“Voss, cut them off!” he barked over his shoulder.

She veered to the side, taking a parallel route through the maze of alleys. The figure stumbled, their foot catching on a loose brick, and Nate closed the distance, tackling them to the ground.

They struggled violently, clawing and kicking, but Nate pinned them down, twisting their arm behind their back.

“Who sent you?” he demanded, his voice cold and sharp.

The figure—a gaunt, nervous-looking man—gasped for breath, his eyes wide with fear. “I-I don’t know! I’m just a runner!”

“Bullshit,” Nate growled, pressing harder. “Talk.”

The man whimpered, shaking his head. “Please! I just deliver! That’s all!”

Voss appeared at the end of the alley, her gun trained on the man. “He’s telling the truth, Cross. Look at him—he’s nobody.”

Nate hesitated, his grip loosening slightly. “Who do you deliver to?”

The man swallowed hard, his voice barely above a whisper. “The Hollowkin.”

Got it! I’ll incorporate the suggested changes moving forward, ensuring Nate's inner conflict, Westgate's significance, and the Hollowkin reveal are given more detail and depth. Let’s pick up from where we left off, keeping the style detailed and immersive.

The man trembled beneath Nate's grip, his breath hitching as he stared at the barrel of Voss's gun. Rainwater mixed with the grime on his face, making him look ghostly pale under the dim streetlight.

“Hollowkin?” Voss’s voice cut through the tension like a blade. She didn’t lower her weapon. “That’s not a name you throw around lightly. Who are they?”

The man swallowed hard, his Adam's apple bobbing. “I—I don’t know much, I swear. They don’t deal with people like me. I just deliver packages, messages. That’s it!”

“Messages to who?” Nate demanded, tightening his grip on the man’s arm. His knuckles whitened, the frustration bubbling to the surface. “Who’s running this show?”

The man whimpered. “I don’t know! They’re... They’re like shadows. You don’t see them unless they want you to.”

Voss exchanged a glance with Nate, her expression unreadable. “You expect us to believe that?” she asked, her tone cold.

“I swear!” the man cried. “They’ll kill me just for saying the name! Please, let me go!”

Nate leaned in closer, his voice a low growl. “If you think they’re scary, you’ve never met me.”

The man’s breath quickened, and for a moment, Nate thought he might pass out. He loosened his grip slightly, just enough to let him speak.

“They’re monsters,” the man whispered. “Real monsters. Not like the vamps you’re used to. They don’t just change their faces; they change... everything.”

Nate’s stomach tightened. The man’s words tugged at something buried deep in his memory, something he’d tried to forget. Westgate.

“What do you mean by everything?” Voss pressed, her tone more urgent now.

The man shook his head, tears streaming down his face. “I’ve said too much. They’ll find me. They’ll kill me.”

Nate let out a frustrated sigh and pulled the man to his feet. “You’re coming with us. Maybe some time in a cell will jog your memory.”

“No!” the man shouted, struggling against Nate’s grip. “You don’t understand! They’re everywhere!”

A sudden, sharp crack echoed through the alley. The man stiffened, his eyes going wide, before crumpling to the ground. Blood pooled beneath him, mixing with the rainwater.

“Sniper!” Voss shouted, pulling Nate behind the nearest dumpster.

Nate cursed under his breath, drawing his gun and scanning the rooftops. The alley was a maze of shadows and angles, the perfect hunting ground for a marksman.

“Do you see them?” Voss asked, her back pressed against the metal bin.

“No,” Nate growled. “Stay low.”

They moved cautiously, sticking to the cover provided by dumpsters and crates. The rain picked up again, the sound of droplets masking any movement above.

Nate’s mind raced. Whoever these Hollowkin were, they had resources—and no qualms about cleaning up loose ends.

When they reached the end of the alley, Nate motioned for Voss to stop. He peered around the corner, his heart pounding. The street beyond was deserted, the flickering neon sign of a convenience store casting eerie reflections on the wet pavement.

“They’re gone,” he muttered, lowering his weapon.

Voss let out a shaky breath, her fingers still clutching her gun. “That was too clean. They were waiting for us.”

Nate nodded, his jaw clenched. “Which means we’re onto something.”

They stood there for a moment, the rain soaking through their clothes. Finally, Voss broke the silence.

“So,” she said, her voice quieter now. “Are you going to tell me what’s going on? Or do I have to guess?”

Nate glanced at her, his expression hard. “Not here. Let’s get back to the precinct.”",2,1736360325.0,Vampire,0,1.0,False

#### Investment Thesis
Starbucks is facing a multitude of headwinds. The company's labor issues, tariffs, and increasing competition will be too much for the new CEO to overcome. Starbucks' strong brand has been tarnished, resulting in boycotts. The coffee quality is often criticized as subpar. Increasing debt levels warrant caution, and Starbucks could be forced to reduce dividends.

#### Risks
- **Economic Downturn**: A global economic slowdown could impact consumer spending on premium beverages.
- **Competition**: The coffeehouse market is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share.
- **Supply Chain Issues**: Disruptions in the supply chain could affect Starbucks' ability to maintain consistent product quality and availability.
- **Debt and Liquidity**: Starbucks has been increasing its long-term debt, nearly doubling it between 2019 and 2021.
- **Tariffs and Geopolitical Tensions**: Ongoing tariffs and geopolitical tensions, particularly with China, could lead to increased costs and reduced market access, further impacting Starbucks' profitability.

#### Conclusion
Starbucks remains a high-risk opportunity, with dwindling growth prospects and an increasingly competitive market. Based on current analyst ratings and financial performance, a price target range of $75 to $85 over the next 12 months

**Chapter 1: Midnight Shadows**

The rain was relentless, hammering down on the City of Midnight as if trying to wash away its sins. Nathaniel Cross sat in his dimly lit office at the precinct, the scent of stale coffee and damp leather clinging to the air. His desk was cluttered with case files and half-finished paperwork, a chaotic reflection of the man himself.

Outside his window, the city flickered with neon lights that barely pierced the gloom. Midnight was supposed to be a fresh start, a place where vampires and humans could coexist after centuries of bloodshed. Instead, it was a powder keg waiting for a spark.

Nate scowled as he flipped through the latest case file. Clare Sutton, 22, gone without a trace. The photo stapled to the corner showed a young woman with bright eyes and a hopeful smile—a face full of life that would likely end up drained and lifeless in a back alley somewhere. Missing persons weren’t uncommon in Midnight, but they were rarely solved.

He set the file down and rubbed his temples. His head throbbed, a dull ache that never seemed to go away. He’d been working this job too long, and the city was eating him alive. But quitting wasn’t an option—not for someone like him.

A sharp knock on the glass pane of his office door pulled him from his thoughts. He looked up to see Chief Harland, his broad shoulders filling the doorway. The man had a face carved from stone, with deep lines that spoke of too many sleepless nights and too many compromises.

“Cross. My office. Now.”

Nate sighed, grabbing his coat as he stood. “What now?” he muttered under his breath.

Chief Harland’s office was no sanctuary. It was as grim and utilitarian as the rest of the precinct, with filing cabinets threatening to burst and the faint smell of cigar smoke hanging in the air. The only personal touch was a faded photograph of Harland and his family, taken long before the city had claimed him.

“Sit,” Harland said, gesturing to the chair opposite his desk.

Nate slumped into the seat, his posture radiating reluctance. “What’s this about?”

Harland slid a folder across the desk, the tab labeled *Evelyn Voss*. Nate’s eyes narrowed as he picked it up.

“A new assignment,” Harland said. “And a new partner.”

Nate froze. His jaw tightened, and he threw the folder back onto the desk without opening it. “Not interested.”

Harland’s expression didn’t change. “It’s not a request. This comes from higher up.”

“I don’t do partners.”

“You do now. There’s a task force being formed. Off the books, high priority. You’re leading it, and Voss is your second.”

Nate shook his head. “No way. I’m not babysitting some rookie.”

Harland leaned forward, his voice dropping to a low rumble. “Voss isn’t a rookie. She’s one of the best we’ve got. Sharp, efficient, and experienced in fieldwork. You’ll need her.”

Nate snorted. “She’s a vampire.”

“And she’s better at this job than half the humans in this precinct. You don’t have to like her, Cross, but you will work with her. That’s an order.”

Nate stood, his fists clenched at his sides. “You can’t expect me to trust her—not after what they did.”

Harland’s gaze softened, but his tone remained firm. “I know what happened. But this isn’t about your past—it’s about this city’s future. We’re hanging by a thread, and you’re one of the few people keeping it together.”

For a long moment, Nate didn’t move. Then, with a sharp nod, he turned and stalked out of the office.

The bullpen was alive with noise, a constant hum of voices and the sharp clatter of keyboards. Nate strode through it like a storm cloud, his scowl enough to part the crowd. He didn’t need to look to know that eyes were on him. Half the precinct probably already knew about this new assignment, and the other half would by the end of the day.

He reached his desk and dropped into his chair, rubbing a hand over his face. The folder Harland had given him sat in his lap, unopened. He didn’t need to read it. He’d seen enough vampires in his time to know what kind of person he was dealing with. They all had that same air of superiority, that barely concealed hunger in their eyes.

“Cross?”

The voice was sharp, clipped, and entirely too close. Nate looked up to see a woman standing at the edge of his desk. She was tall, her black suit perfectly tailored, and her green eyes locked onto his with an intensity that was unsettling. Evelyn Voss. She didn’t look like the vampires Nate was used to dealing with—no gothic flair or predatory smirk. Just a cold, calculated professionalism that somehow felt worse.

“You must be Voss,” he said, leaning back in his chair. His tone was laced with disdain. “Nice to see Harland wasn’t exaggerating.”

“And you must be Nathaniel Cross,” she replied. Her voice was smooth, with just a hint of an accent Nate couldn’t place. “I’ve heard... mixed reviews.”

He smirked. “Let me guess—too angry, too stubborn, doesn’t play well with others?”

Her expression didn’t change. “Something like that.”

Nate gestured to the empty chair across from his desk. “Well, if we’re going to be stuck together, you might as well sit down.”

She hesitated, just for a moment, before taking the seat. Her movements were precise, controlled, like she was always calculating her next move. Nate hated it.

“Let’s get one thing straight,” he said, leaning forward. “I don’t trust you. I don’t like you. And I sure as hell don’t want you on my team. But Harland seems to think you’re worth something, so I’ll give you a chance. One chance. Don’t screw it up.”

Her lips twitched, the closest thing to a smile he’d seen. “Noted.”

The tension between them was palpable, drawing the attention of a few nearby officers. Nate ignored them, focusing instead on the case file in front of him. He didn’t care how good Voss was supposed to be. As far as he was concerned, this partnership was doomed from the start.

Voss didn’t say much after that, content to let the awkward silence fill the space between them. Nate worked through the case file, flipping through pages with more force than necessary. He could feel her watching him, studying him, and it grated on his nerves.

“You’re staring,” he muttered without looking up.

“I’m assessing,” she corrected. “You have a reputation, Cross. It’s... interesting to see if you live up to it.”

“And what’s the verdict so far?”

She tilted her head slightly, her green eyes narrowing. “You’re angry. Very angry. But you’re also methodical. Even when you’re pissed, you’re thorough. That’s rare.”

Nate snorted. “Spare me the psychoanalysis. I’m not one of your case studies.”

“I wasn’t aware I needed your permission to form an opinion,” she said smoothly.

He slammed the file shut, the sharp sound drawing a few glances from nearby desks. “Look, Voss, if you think this little task force is going to be some bonding exercise, you’re in for a rude awakening. We’re not friends. We’re not partners. We’re two people forced into the same corner.”

“Understood,” she said, her tone so neutral it made his teeth grind.

Nate stood abruptly, grabbing his coat. “I need some air.”

He stalked toward the exit, leaving Voss sitting there. He needed space, distance, something to clear his head before he said something he couldn’t take back.

Outside, the rain had slowed to a drizzle, the streets shimmering under the dim glow of streetlights. Midnight never really slept; there was always movement, always noise. Nate lit a cigarette, taking a long drag as he leaned against the precinct’s brick wall.

The memories hit him before he could push them back, creeping into his mind like a cold fog.

It was a night much like this one, years ago, before Midnight had even been conceived. He’d been a different man then—idealistic, hopeful, stupid.

They’d been called to a small town on the outskirts of nowhere. Reports of strange disappearances, livestock slaughtered, families vanishing. Vampires, though the word hadn’t been spoken out loud. Back then, most people didn’t believe in them. Nate had been one of them.

The first body they found was a boy, no older than ten. His throat had been torn out, his skin pale as snow. The house was empty, the rest of the family missing, but the bloodstains told a clear story. They hadn’t gone quietly.

They followed the trail to a farmhouse on the edge of town. The windows were boarded up, the air thick with the stench of death. Nate had gone in first, his partner close behind. What they found inside still haunted his nightmares.

Bodies, dozens of them, strung up like cattle in a slaughterhouse. The blood had been drained from them, collected in barrels that lined the walls. And in the center of it all was a vampire—a woman with eyes like molten gold and a smile that chilled his soul.

She’d killed his partner before he could blink, moving faster than anything he’d ever seen. Nate had barely gotten a shot off before she was on him, her claws ripping through his flesh like paper. He’d thought he was going to die that night, but somehow, he’d survived. The scars on his chest were a constant reminder of how close he’d come.

The memory faded as his cigarette burned down to the filter. Nate crushed it under his heel, his hands shaking. He hated them—every single one of them. And now he was supposed to work with one? It was almost laughable.

He heard the door open behind him and turned to see Voss stepping out, her expression unreadable. She didn’t say anything, just stood there, watching him.

“Didn’t take you for a smoker,” he said, his voice rough.

“I’m not. But you seemed... agitated.”

Nate laughed bitterly. “That’s one word for it.”

She hesitated, then stepped closer. “I know this isn’t easy for you. It’s not easy for me, either. But we don’t have to like each other to do the job.”

“Is that supposed to be some kind of pep talk?”

“It’s reality,” she said. “You don’t trust me, and I get that. But we’re on the same side, whether you believe it or not.”

Nate studied her for a long moment, searching for any hint of insincerity. He didn’t find any.

“Fine,” he said finally. “Let’s get one thing straight, though. You screw up, and I won’t hesitate to call you out. Got it?”

“Crystal clear,” she said, her lips quirking into a faint smile.

He didn’t return it.

The next few days were tense, the kind of tension that settled in the pit of Nate’s stomach and refused to let go. Voss moved through the precinct like she belonged there, her sharp eyes taking in everything and everyone. Nate hated how composed she always seemed, like nothing could touch her.

He, on the other hand, felt like he was unraveling. Every sideways glance from his colleagues, every muttered comment about “working with one of them,” only added to the weight on his shoulders. He didn’t want this, didn’t ask for it, but now it was his cross to bear.

By the third day, Harland called them into his office.

The chief’s office was cluttered, the walls lined with old case files and commendations that no one bothered to dust. Harland leaned back in his chair, his fingers steepled as he watched Nate and Voss settle into the chairs opposite him.

“I assume you’ve had time to... get acquainted,” Harland said, his tone carefully neutral.

Nate grunted. Voss, of course, remained silent.

“I’m going to be blunt,” Harland continued. “This task force is a big deal. If it works, it sets a precedent—not just for Midnight, but for every city still figuring out how to handle the integration.”

“Integration,” Nate said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. “Is that what we’re calling it now?”

Harland shot him a warning look. “You don’t have to like it, Cross. You just have to make it work.”

“And what exactly are we supposed to be working on?”

Harland slid a file across the desk. “A body was found in the North End two nights ago. At first glance, it looked like a standard homicide. But forensics found traces of a paralytic toxin in the victim’s blood—something that hasn’t been used since before vampires revealed themselves.”

Voss picked up the file, her expression unreadable as she flipped through it. “This toxin... you’re saying it’s vampiric in origin?”

“That’s what the lab thinks,” Harland said. “Which means this case falls squarely under your jurisdiction.”

Nate leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms. “Great. So we’re chasing a vampire killer. Just what I needed to round out my week.”

“Not just any vampire,” Harland said. “The kind that doesn’t play by the council’s rules. If this gets out, it’ll cause a shitstorm—not just for us, but for them, too.”

“So, damage control,” Voss said, her tone even.

“Exactly. Find whoever’s responsible and shut it down. Quietly.”

Nate glanced at Voss, then back at Harland. “And if it’s not quiet?”

“Then you’d better hope your new partner is as good as her file says she is,” Harland said, his gaze sharp.

They left the office in silence, the weight of the case pressing down on both of them. Back at his desk, Nate watched as Voss spread the crime scene photos across the surface, her focus razor-sharp.

“You don’t waste time, do you?” he muttered.

“Time isn’t a luxury we have,” she replied without looking up.

Nate sighed and leaned over, scanning the photos. The victim was a middle-aged man, his body pale and contorted. The puncture marks on his neck were faint, almost invisible, but they were there.

“You’re awfully calm about this,” Nate said, his voice low.

“This isn’t my first case,” she replied. “And it won’t be my last.”

“Yeah, well, don’t get too comfortable. Midnight has a way of chewing people up and spitting them out.”

She finally looked up, her green eyes meeting his. “Maybe. But I’m not like most people.”

Nate didn’t have a response to that, so he grabbed his coat and headed for the door. “Come on. Let’s see if the lab has anything new for us.”

The forensics lab was tucked away in the basement of the precinct, a stark contrast to the chaos of the bullpen. Nate always hated coming down here—the sterile smell, the harsh lighting, the constant hum of machines.

Dr. Marcus Webb was hunched over a microscope when they walked in, his graying hair sticking up in every direction. He looked up as they approached, his eyes lighting up when he saw Voss.

“Well, if it isn’t the infamous Evelyn Voss,” he said, standing and offering her a hand. “I’ve heard a lot about you.”

“All good things, I hope,” Voss said, shaking his hand.

“Mostly,” Webb said with a grin. “And you must be Cross. Heard you’re a pain in the ass.”

“Glad my reputation precedes me,” Nate said dryly.

Webb chuckled and gestured for them to follow him. “I’ve got something you’ll want to see.”

He led them to a workstation where a series of vials were lined up next to a computer.

“This,” he said, holding up one of the vials, “is what we found in the victim’s bloodstream. A paralytic toxin—potent, fast-acting, and almost undetectable.”

“Almost,” Voss said.

“Right. Whoever used this was careful, but not careful enough. I was able to isolate the compound, and it matches a substance that was popular among rogue vampires about fifty years ago.”

Nate frowned. “Fifty years? Why would anyone bring it back now?”

“That’s the million-dollar question,” Webb said. “But here’s the kicker—this version is more refined. Someone’s been perfecting it.”

Voss exchanged a glance with Nate. “Which means they’re planning to use it again.”

“Exactly,” Webb said. “And if they’re not stopped, you can bet the body count will climb.”

 

 

 

 

 

**Chapter 2**

The streets of Midnight carried a heavy silence at night, broken only by the occasional wail of a distant siren or the low hum of passing vehicles. Nate Cross walked ahead of Evelyn Voss, his coat billowing slightly in the cool breeze. He didn’t slow his pace, didn’t offer her the courtesy of a glance, but he knew she was there. The faint sound of her boots on the pavement was a constant reminder.

“Do you always walk like you’re trying to leave someone behind?” Voss asked.

Nate’s lip twitched in irritation, but he didn’t respond. He turned a corner sharply, heading toward the victim’s apartment. The area wasn’t the best—rows of dilapidated buildings with boarded-up windows and graffiti tagging nearly every surface. It was the kind of place where crimes went unsolved, and residents learned not to ask too many questions.

“You’ll get used to it,” Nate finally muttered.

“Get used to what?”

“Everything. The city. The people. The fact that you’re never really welcome.”

“Is that what you tell yourself?”

Nate stopped abruptly, spinning to face her. “Listen, Voss. I’m here because I have to be. You? You’re here because Harland thinks this little partnership is some kind of progressive PR stunt. You don’t belong here.”

She tilted her head slightly, her expression calm, infuriatingly composed. “I’ve been hearing that my entire life. You’ll have to try harder if you’re hoping to hurt my feelings.”

“Trust me, that’s not the goal,” Nate snapped, turning back around.

They climbed a narrow staircase in the victim’s apartment building, the air stale and carrying a faint metallic tang that Nate had come to associate with blood. He knocked twice on the door before pushing it open.

The apartment was a crime scene frozen in time. Blood spatter painted the walls, furniture overturned in what had clearly been a struggle. Voss entered behind him, her sharp eyes scanning the room.

“Do you always charge in without waiting for backup?” she asked, her tone light but tinged with something sharper.

“Backup’s a luxury we don’t have,” Nate replied.

Nate moved through the room with practiced ease, his eyes darting between the scattered evidence. He crouched near a coffee table that had been overturned, its legs splintered. A pool of dried blood had collected beneath it, dark and sticky, the coppery smell filling the air.

Voss remained by the doorway, watching him. “Anything stand out?”

He didn’t answer immediately, instead picking up a broken picture frame. The photograph inside was spattered with blood but still visible—a man in his late forties, smiling with a younger woman at what looked like a park. The kind of photo that didn’t belong in a scene like this.

Nate set it aside and stood, brushing his hands off on his coat. “Looks like a standard break-in gone wrong, except for the part where the perp used an illegal vampiric toxin.”

Voss stepped further into the room, her movements deliberate, almost predatory. She crouched near the bloodstain, her fingers hovering just above the floor. “This wasn’t random.”

“You can tell that just by looking at a bloodstain?”

She ignored his sarcasm, standing and pointing toward the far wall. “No signs of forced entry. Whoever did this was invited in.”

Nate frowned, following her gaze. The doorframe was intact, the lock undamaged. She was right—someone had let the killer in.

“Maybe the vic knew them,” he said, his voice quieter now. “Trusted them.”

“Or they didn’t have a choice.”

Her words hung in the air, heavy and undeniable. Nate felt the familiar weight of frustration creeping in, the same one he’d carried since this case began.

He turned abruptly, heading toward the bedroom. “Let’s see if there’s anything useful in here.”

The bedroom was small and sparsely furnished. A single bed sat against one wall, the covers rumpled as if someone had left in a hurry. A nightstand held a stack of books, a lamp, and a half-empty glass of water.

Nate rifled through the drawers while Voss examined the closet. It wasn’t long before she pulled something out—a small black case with a silver clasp.

“Found something,” she said, holding it up.

Nate crossed the room, taking the case from her. It was heavier than he expected, the metal cool against his skin. He popped the clasp, revealing a set of syringes filled with a faintly glowing liquid.

“The toxin,” Voss said, her voice barely above a whisper.

Nate’s jaw tightened. “Looks like our victim wasn’t as innocent as we thought.”

Nate set the case down on the bed and stared at it, his mind racing. The toxin wasn’t just illegal—it was dangerous, capable of paralyzing vampires and humans alike. The faint glow from the liquid made his stomach churn. He’d seen this before, years ago, in another case that ended with too many bodies.

Voss crossed her arms, watching his expression. “You’ve dealt with this before.”

“Not like this,” Nate replied, though his tone suggested otherwise. He snapped the case shut. “This changes everything. If the victim was involved with this, they weren’t just a target—they were part of something bigger.”

Voss raised an eyebrow. “Bigger, how?”

Nate didn’t answer immediately. He leaned against the wall, his gaze fixed on the case. “Back in the early days, when the city was still being built, there were whispers about this kind of stuff. Underground networks. Humans trying to ‘level the playing field.’” He scoffed. “Guess they thought it was a good idea to weaponize the thing they feared most.”

“Poetic,” Voss said dryly.

“More like suicidal.”

The sound of footsteps outside the apartment broke their conversation. Nate was on alert instantly, his hand instinctively going to his holstered weapon. Voss moved silently to the door, her head tilted as she listened.

The door creaked open, and a uniformed officer stepped inside. It was Davies, a rookie who always looked like he’d rather be anywhere else. He froze when he saw Voss, his hand hovering near his own weapon.

“It’s fine, Davies,” Nate said, lowering his gun. “She’s with me.”

The officer nodded stiffly but didn’t relax. “Chief wants an update,” he said, his voice cracking slightly.

Nate exchanged a glance with Voss before turning back to the rookie. “Tell him we’ve got a lead. I’ll fill him in when we’re back.”

Davies hesitated, his eyes darting between the two of them. Finally, he nodded and disappeared as quickly as he’d come.

“Friendly bunch,” Voss remarked, leaning against the doorframe.

Nate let out a humorless laugh. “You get used to it.”

Voss didn’t reply, but her expression softened just enough for Nate to notice.

The ride back to the precinct was suffocating. Nate drove in silence, his knuckles white against the steering wheel. Voss sat beside him, her hands folded neatly in her lap, her calm demeanor a stark contrast to the tension in the air. The rain tapped steadily against the windshield, blurring the neon lights of the city into streaks of color.

“You always this talkative?” Voss finally asked, her tone light but probing.

“Depends on the company,” Nate replied, his eyes fixed on the road.

“Let me guess,” she said, smirking. “The strong, silent type. Lone wolf. The guy who doesn’t play well with others.”

Nate tightened his grip on the wheel. “I’m here to do a job. Not make friends.”

“Right,” Voss said, leaning back in her seat. “Because being a martyr is so much more productive.”

Nate shot her a glare but said nothing.

The precinct loomed ahead, its stark, utilitarian architecture a sharp contrast to the chaotic vibrancy of the city around it. Nate pulled into the underground parking lot, cutting the engine with a sharp twist of the key.

“Welcome to paradise,” he muttered as they stepped out.

The precinct was alive with activity, officers bustling about, phones ringing, and the hum of conversations filling the air. Voss drew a few curious glances as she walked beside Nate, but most people avoided meeting her gaze.

“Stay close,” Nate said over his shoulder as he led her through the maze of desks and filing cabinets.

They reached Chief Harland’s office, the door slightly ajar. Nate knocked once before pushing it open.

Harland looked up from his desk, his eyes narrowing as they landed on Voss. He was a broad man with graying hair and a face that looked like it had seen too many late nights and bad decisions.

“Cross,” Harland said, his tone gruff. “You’ve got something for me?”

Nate dropped the black case onto the desk. “Toxin. Found it at the vic’s place. Looks like he was dealing.”

Harland frowned, opening the case and inspecting the contents. “This just got a whole lot messier.”

“No kidding,” Nate said.

Harland glanced at Voss. “And you’re... the new transfer?”

“Evelyn Voss,” she said, extending a hand.

Harland didn’t take it. Instead, he leaned back in his chair, his gaze sharp. “You’ve got a lot to prove, Voss. I don’t take risks lightly, and bringing you in? That’s a hell of a gamble.”

“I’m not here to disappoint,” she said, her voice steady.

“We’ll see,” Harland replied, closing the case. He turned his attention back to Nate. “You’re taking her with you. Like it or not, she’s part of this now.”

Nate’s jaw clenched. “Chief—”

“Not a discussion, Cross,” Harland said, cutting him off. “Get out there and figure this out before we’ve got more bodies on our hands.”

Nate stormed out of the office, his boots echoing against the linoleum floor. Voss followed, her heels clicking rhythmically behind him. The buzz of the precinct seemed louder now, officers darting past, conversations overlapping.

“Want to talk about it?” Voss asked, her tone irritatingly casual.

“No,” Nate snapped, weaving through the crowded space toward his desk.

“Good,” she said, unfazed. “Because I wasn’t really asking.”

He stopped abruptly, spinning to face her. “Listen, you might’ve impressed Harland, but that doesn’t mean I have to like it. Just stay out of my way and do what you’re told.”

Voss crossed her arms, her lips curving into a faint smirk. “You’ve got a funny way of saying ‘welcome aboard.’”

Before Nate could retort, a voice called out from across the room. “Cross! You got a sec?”

It was Jordan, one of the forensic techs. She was standing by her workstation, holding a tablet. Nate exhaled sharply and turned away from Voss without another word.

“What do you got?” Nate asked as he approached.

Jordan handed him the tablet, her brow furrowed. “Ran a preliminary on the toxin. It’s a modified version of something we’ve seen before—designed to work faster, hit harder.”

Nate scanned the data on the screen, his stomach sinking. “This isn’t street-level stuff.”

“No,” Jordan agreed. “Whoever made this knew what they were doing. This is high-end, military-grade, maybe even custom.”

Nate’s mind raced. The implications were worse than he’d thought. If this kind of toxin was making its way into the city, it wasn’t just about a few back-alley deals. This was organized, deliberate.

“You’re gonna love this part,” Jordan added, pulling up another screen. “The chemical markers? They match a batch confiscated a year ago. Guess where.”

Nate didn’t need to guess. The answer was already forming in his mind, unwelcome and unavoidable.

“Westgate,” he said grimly.

Jordan nodded. “Looks like someone’s picking up where they left off.”

Voss, who had been listening silently, stepped closer. “What’s Westgate?”

Nate hesitated, his jaw tightening. “An old case. Ended badly.”

“How badly?”

“Bodies in the morgue. Case closed. Or so we thought.”

Voss’s eyes narrowed. “And now it’s open again.”

“Seems that way,” Nate said, handing the tablet back to Jordan. “Thanks.”

Jordan gave him a sympathetic look before returning to her work.

Nate turned to Voss, his expression hard. “If you’re coming along, you’d better keep up. This isn’t gonna be pretty.”

“Wouldn’t dream of slowing you down,” she said, falling into step beside him.

The rain had slowed to a drizzle by the time they reached the car. Nate climbed in without a word, the tension between him and Voss as heavy as the humidity in the air. She slid into the passenger seat, her expression unreadable, and fastened her seatbelt with deliberate calm.

“Westgate,” she said after a moment, breaking the silence. “You’re going to have to tell me about it eventually.”

Nate started the engine, his jaw tightening. “Not now.”

Voss didn’t push further, though the curiosity lingered in her eyes.

The drive took them toward the older part of the city, where the gleaming skyscrapers gave way to crumbling brick facades and narrow, uneven streets. This was Midnight’s underbelly, where neon signs flickered and shadows lingered long after sundown.

They parked outside a dilapidated warehouse, the kind of place that screamed “illegal activity.” Nate killed the engine and checked his weapon.

“Stay close,” he said, stepping out into the damp night air.

Voss followed, her boots crunching softly against the gravel. “You say that like I’m planning to wander off.”

They approached the warehouse cautiously, the scent of mildew and rust heavy in the air. The large metal doors were slightly ajar, creaking with each gust of wind. Nate signaled for Voss to stay back as he pushed the door open, his gun drawn.

Inside, the air was thick with the stench of decay. The faint glow of a single hanging bulb cast long, distorted shadows across the cluttered space.

“Smell that?” Voss whispered, wrinkling her nose.

“Yeah,” Nate replied grimly, moving deeper into the room.

The source of the smell became apparent quickly. A body lay slumped against a stack of crates, its features twisted in a rictus of agony. The flesh was discolored, the veins stark against the pallid skin.

“Second victim,” Voss murmured, crouching beside the body.

Nate nodded, scanning the room for any signs of movement. “Same toxin?”

“Looks like it,” she said, her gloved hand hovering over the corpse. “But this one wasn’t just exposed. This was... concentrated.”

Nate’s stomach turned. He’d seen enough death to be numb to it, but there was something about this that felt different. Targeted.

A sound echoed from deeper within the warehouse—a faint scrape of metal against concrete. Nate froze, his gun trained on the direction of the noise.

“Stay here,” he hissed to Voss, moving toward the sound.

She ignored him, following at a distance, her own weapon drawn.

The noise led them to a back room, the door slightly ajar. Nate pushed it open cautiously, revealing a makeshift lab. Tables were strewn with glass vials, burners, and handwritten notes. The air was sharp with the tang of chemicals.

“Jackpot,” Voss said quietly, stepping inside.

“Or a trap,” Nate muttered, his eyes scanning every corner of the room.

A sudden movement to his left made him spin, his gun snapping up. A figure darted past, quick and shadowy.

“Stop!” Nate shouted, giving chase.

The figure bolted toward the rear exit, crashing through the door and into the rain-soaked alley. Nate was on their heels, his breath coming in sharp bursts.

“Voss, cut them off!” he barked over his shoulder.

She veered to the side, taking a parallel route through the maze of alleys. The figure stumbled, their foot catching on a loose brick, and Nate closed the distance, tackling them to the ground.

They struggled violently, clawing and kicking, but Nate pinned them down, twisting their arm behind their back.

“Who sent you?” he demanded, his voice cold and sharp.

The figure—a gaunt, nervous-looking man—gasped for breath, his eyes wide with fear. “I-I don’t know! I’m just a runner!”

“Bullshit,” Nate growled, pressing harder. “Talk.”

The man whimpered, shaking his head. “Please! I just deliver! That’s all!”

Voss appeared at the end of the alley, her gun trained on the man. “He’s telling the truth, Cross. Look at him—he’s nobody.”

Nate hesitated, his grip loosening slightly. “Who do you deliver to?”

The man swallowed hard, his voice barely above a whisper. “The Hollowkin.”

Got it! I’ll incorporate the suggested changes moving forward, ensuring Nate's inner conflict, Westgate's significance, and the Hollowkin reveal are given more detail and depth. Let’s pick up from where we left off, keeping the style detailed and immersive.

The man trembled beneath Nate's grip, his breath hitching as he stared at the barrel of Voss's gun. Rainwater mixed with the grime on his face, making him look ghostly pale under the dim streetlight.

“Hollowkin?” Voss’s voice cut through the tension like a blade. She didn’t lower her weapon. “That’s not a name you throw around lightly. Who are they?”

The man swallowed hard, his Adam's apple bobbing. “I—I don’t know much, I swear. They don’t deal with people like me. I just deliver packages, messages. That’s it!”

“Messages to who?” Nate demanded, tightening his grip on the man’s arm. His knuckles whitened, the frustration bubbling to the surface. “Who’s running this show?”

The man whimpered. “I don’t know! They’re... They’re like shadows. You don’t see them unless they want you to.”

Voss exchanged a glance with Nate, her expression unreadable. “You expect us to believe that?” she asked, her tone cold.

“I swear!” the man cried. “They’ll kill me just for saying the name! Please, let me go!”

Nate leaned in closer, his voice a low growl. “If you think they’re scary, you’ve never met me.”

The man’s breath quickened, and for a moment, Nate thought he might pass out. He loosened his grip slightly, just enough to let him speak.

“They’re monsters,” the man whispered. “Real monsters. Not like the vamps you’re used to. They don’t just change their faces; they change... everything.”

Nate’s stomach tightened. The man’s words tugged at something buried deep in his memory, something he’d tried to forget. Westgate.

“What do you mean by everything?” Voss pressed, her tone more urgent now.

The man shook his head, tears streaming down his face. “I’ve said too much. They’ll find me. They’ll kill me.”

Nate let out a frustrated sigh and pulled the man to his feet. “You’re coming with us. Maybe some time in a cell will jog your memory.”

“No!” the man shouted, struggling against Nate’s grip. “You don’t understand! They’re everywhere!”

A sudden, sharp crack echoed through the alley. The man stiffened, his eyes going wide, before crumpling to the ground. Blood pooled beneath him, mixing with the rainwater.

“Sniper!” Voss shouted, pulling Nate behind the nearest dumpster.

Nate cursed under his breath, drawing his gun and scanning the rooftops. The alley was a maze of shadows and angles, the perfect hunting ground for a marksman.

“Do you see them?” Voss asked, her back pressed against the metal bin.

“No,” Nate growled. “Stay low.”

They moved cautiously, sticking to the cover provided by dumpsters and crates. The rain picked up again, the sound of droplets masking any movement above.

Nate’s mind raced. Whoever these Hollowkin were, they had resources—and no qualms about cleaning up loose ends.

When they reached the end of the alley, Nate motioned for Voss to stop. He peered around the corner, his heart pounding. The street beyond was deserted, the flickering neon sign of a convenience store casting eerie reflections on the wet pavement.

“They’re gone,” he muttered, lowering his weapon.

Voss let out a shaky breath, her fingers still clutching her gun. “That was too clean. They were waiting for us.”

Nate nodded, his jaw clenched. “Which means we’re onto something.”

They stood there for a moment, the rain soaking through their clothes. Finally, Voss broke the silence.

“So,” she said, her voice quieter now. “Are you going to tell me what’s going on? Or do I have to guess?”

Nate glanced at her, his expression hard. “Not here. Let’s get back to the precinct.”",3,1736360247.0,creativewriting,1,1.0,False
1hwqvef,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hwqvef/seeing_your_avoidant_ex_again/,Seeing your avoidant ex again ,"Good evening ! 3 months after being dumped by my avoidant ex I was finally able to see her again. It was a short but intense story. I know she left me reluctantly, she was very clingy and she left overnight. I learned that she lied to her best friend by making her believe that we were still together a month after the breakup when I had no news (maybe she didn't accept the breakup?) . I tried to contact her after 3 weeks, she answered me then stopped responding. So I kept calm and tried to contact her every 3 weeks or so. Each contact was longer and more enthusiastic each time. Sometimes she stopped responding to me even though she seemed involved. Then when I started to let go of the matter she always came and put a like on the networks as if to show that she was there. 

After almost a month of new radio silence, I wished her a happy new year 2025. She answered me and asked me lots of questions about my life, something that hadn't happened since the breakup. The next day she was coming back from Paris so she passed my village, something she never does (we live 130 km from each other). She sent me a photo of my village on Snapchat while passing on the highway. This is the first time she contacted me herself, without me doing so first. 

3 days later I wrote to him for a drink in his village. She responded in less than a minute and accepted directly by inviting me to her place because the bars are closed in winter. I went there yesterday. Unfortunately we were not alone because a friend of hers stopped by to drink coffee. I think it suited her because she was stressed about us talking about a breakup (something I hadn't expected). 

As I left I told him that I had a good time but that I hadn't had time to tell him all the funny stories that had happened to me since the breakup. She laughed and said, “You’ll explain it to me later.” 

I would like to know if I suggest another meeting next week or if I wait a bit? Some people will tell me to let go of an avoidant, but I don't want to. ",1,1736360237.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1hwqsb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hwqsb2/five_years_no_answers/,Five years — no answers ,"Hello all! Looking for some insight as to what this could possibly be. I am a 31F, and I take Buspar and Sertraline, plus Rosuvastatin for medications. I also take allergy medication and a multivitamin daily. I do not use any forms of drugs or smoke. I drink occasionally (once every two weeks). Of note, I had a previous 3.4 cm cyst on my left ovary, and my mom passed away pretty traumatically 5 years ago. I am receiving therapy for grief, and I have an anxiety disorder. 

For the past five-ish years, I have been having lower abdominal pain. It’s crampy, usually, and it feels like it is focused in and or around my hips. I was initially told it was anxiety, and I should “be less anxious.” When this did not work, I was referred to OB by my PCP multiple times — have had multiple normal transvaginal ultrasounds. Birth control also did not clear it up. I was tested for PCOS, and put on metformin which helped me lose about 20 pounds, but was taken off Metformin and told my testosterone was normal so I did not have PCOS. The OB I saw last floated an endometriosis diagnosis but discouraged surgery “just for the sake of surgery.” My periods are not normal — they are anywhere from 28 to 50 day cycles, and they are PAINFUL, but I have never gone into the ER about it because what is an ER doc going to do that I could not try at home? I have also in the past had rectal pain while having bowel movements on my period, and I have had pain with sex in the past but assumed it was me not being into it or being in a weird position. 

In the past, the abdominal pain has caused the frequency of my bowels to change, and I have occasional mucus in my stools. This lasted for about a year but cleared up on its own (this cleared up around the time I went on more anxiety medication, to be honest). I do not experience nausea or constipation, blood in my stools, or any kind of weight loss. My appetite has not changed. I do not get fevers with it either. I am able to continue working out and lifting weights. I do have lower back pain, but that has felt constant, for years. I also get hemorrhoids. 

Now, the pain has become focalized around my LLQ, near my hip. It is not painful all the time, and it feels like the pain radiates into my hip and sits there. There are occasional lightning bolts of pain in my vagina. The pain is worse at night. The pain is potentially also accompanied by pressure, but I can move and eat and poop normally. The pain feels deep, if that makes sense. I have bowel movements once or twice a day, depending on coffee consumption, and they are solid. Still no fever, no nausea, no blood in my bowel movements. I am still lifting weights. My new PCP ordered a CT scan. 

I am wondering what she could be looking for? And if I should ask for a referral to a GI doc? I’m lost, and I’m worried, and I would be grateful for any assistance. I have been dealing with this for years, and I am tired. ",1,1736360022.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
