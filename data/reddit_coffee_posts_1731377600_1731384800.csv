1gpajrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1gpajrz/keeping_their_memories/,Keeping their memories.,"The past few years have been incredibly tough. I’m proud of myself for being able to stand here today, remembering everything without breaking down.


Every ber months (any months that ends with ber ex. November) my grandparents would start decorating the house with Christmas ornaments, having Christmas music early in the morning and practicing which dishes to do in Christmas eve. As a teenager, i felt a bit sofocated, my sister's and i lost our parents early and it felt like Christmas is a reminder that i don't have a complete family. I didn't really pay attention to my grandparents efforts during that time.

In my college days, i got more closer to my grandparents, doing most errands with them, driving them to places they need to be. When covid happened, we were actually doing fine, i was working online and so our financial wasnt hit like everyone else. By the 2nd year of covid and things loosen up, we would go to to beach almost everyday. I work night shift and before i sleep, i will hang out with them, preparing breakfast or doing a quick drive to the beach to catch some vitamin d.

Im writing this to help myself remember what it was like. Having their favorite Christmas songs in the speaker, smelling the breakfast and freshly made coffee. Feeling the sun in my back. I truly cannot express how lucky I was. 

Im on a different journey of my life and theres no day where i wouldn't remember them. When i feel doubt i already know what they'll tell me. When im cooking, i hear them guiding me and telling me what NOT to do lol. I was a very forgetful person and hence why i wanna try to remember them so much.

Im scared that one day i wont remember how they sound and look like. 

Ma, Pa i miss you so much.",1,1731379072.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False
1gpajij,https://www.reddit.com/r/cmhocpress/comments/1gpajij/the_general_attends_services_at_canadian_national/,The General Attends Services At Canadian National Vimy Memorial in France,"*The General, being a retired service member herself, knows the importance of Remembrance Day. For her, this day is one of the most holy days, made to honor those who put it all on the line and made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. The General made arrangements to attend a service at the Canadian National Vimy Memorial in Vimy, France, departing on a commercial red eye flight out of Toronto Pearson the night before. She landed early in the morning, well rested despite the constraints of her basic economy seat. Today was a solemn day, and The General was sure to respect that. She arrived at the memorial service, wearing a light blue dress adorned with a poppy. After hearing from a variety of speakers, including a local French politician, The General was invited to give brief remarks. She took to the stage, and took in the sights around her.*  
“Good morning to all of you here with me today. Remembrance Day is one of the most important days to me. For those of you who do not know, I proudly served as a Brigadier-General in the Canadian Armed Forces for over 3 decades, and dedicated my life to service, patriotism, and protecting the freedoms that make Canada great. I have lost many brothers and sisters in arms during my service, and every year on this day I like to highlight the bravery of one. Today, I’d like to share with you the story of Lieutenant Dan Haverson. Lieutenant Haverson was one of my officers during my tour of duty in Afghanistan in 2002. The two of us bonded back home in Canada during our time at Garrison Petawawa, sharing stories over morning cups of coffee and doing training sessions together. Lieutenant Haverson was a second brother to me. We quickly found out our unit would be deployed to Kandahar to help in the global fight against the islamist Taliban regime. While many of us were worried, Lieutenant Haverson remained a beacon of hope and a significant morale boost during the first few months on the ground. Lieutenant Haverson proved himself to be a true leader, commanding the respect of both his subordinates and senior officers alike. I wish I could bring Lieutenant Haverson on stage with me to talk about his love for service, but unfortunately, I cannot. Lieutenant Daniel Haverson made the ultimate sacrifice in 2003, laying down his life for the safety of his fellow soldiers. While out on patrol, his squadron was ambushed by guerilla terrorists. A grenade was thrown in the direction of his soldiers, and with little time to spare, Lieutenant Haverson did the unthinkable. In order to spare the lives and safety of his fellow brothers and sisters in arms, Lieutenant Haverson dived on top of the grenade, absorbing the shock and ending his life. Lieutenant Haverson put his love for his country and for the freedoms of Canadians above all else, and he made the ultimate sacrifice by doing so. It is this very same sacrifice that we commemorate here at the Canadian National Vimy Memorial. Vimy Ridge was an important battle in World War I, turning the tide of the war by pushing back the German advances into France. Vimy Ridge was also the first battle of the war with all four Canadian divisions participating. During the battle of Vimy Ridge the Canadian army showed bravery, courage, and determination, winning in spite of all odds. Their spirit and conviction is a reflection of the Canadian spirit. My friends, while this is a solemn day, let this also be a day for us to celebrate the lives of our fallen soldiers, and give them the dues they deserve for putting the greater good above themselves. Thank you.”

1gpaihh,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gpaihh/long_story_short_she_came_back_then_unfollowed/,"Long Story Short: She Came Back, Then Unfollowed – Now What?"," It all started when we met in college last year. We were working on the same project, exchanged phone numbers, got along pretty well, and started texting every so often. I didn’t ask her, but she mentioned she had a boyfriend, and I didn’t say anything about having feelings for her (which I do) and carried on with the rest of the school year.
One year later, on a random night, I hadn’t thought about this girl since college, but all of a sudden she came to mind, and I was thinking, 'I wonder what she’s up to.' The next day, she followed me on Instagram! I was like, there’s no way—I was just thinking about her, and the next day she followed me. I was so happy. I followed her back, and we started talking and getting along great.
A couple of days later, she asked me, 'Do you like me?' and I said, 'Yes, I do like you…' She mentioned she broke up with her boyfriend a month ago. When she told me that, I was thrilled; she also mentioned that the reason she was being distant with me before was because she was catching feelings for me and didn’t want to ruin her relationship, which I totally understood. Then, in almost every text she sent, she started repeating the last letter of words, like 'Awwww' or 'Totallyyyyy.'
Now we’ve started to flirt with each other, and I wanted to do random things with her, like going to a movie theater or restaurant. She even wanted me to go with her to her friend’s wedding as her plus-one, lol. I hadn’t seen her for a while, so she invited me to come by her work, where she’d give me a free coffee. Before I went, I bought her a bag of her favorite candy and decorated it with our favorite football teams. When I arrived, my heart was racing—I couldn’t believe my crush from college liked me. As soon as I walked in, she smiled and gave me a hug, and she really liked the gift I gave her. We talked when she was on her break, and I noticed some good body language—when a girl gets shy or nervous, she often plays with her hair, which she did. We talked for about twenty minutes, and when her break was almost over, she walked me to my car. We hugged twice, and they were long hugs. I thanked her for the coffee, and I was on my way home.
Before we met up, she’d told me her parents are strict and that she wanted to focus on herself before starting to date again, and I was cool with that. At this point in the story, you’re probably thinking, 'Okay, there’s no way this story can get weird, right?' But the next day, I texted her to say thanks again for last night and that I hoped she enjoyed her candy. She replied, 'You’re welcome, and thank you for the candy.' I asked about her day, and she said it went well. Then she texted me this:
'I also spoke with my parents right now and told them about you and I just you know hanging out but my parents don’t think it’s good for me right now to be talking with someone cause they ya know assume and were right I have some feelings for you but they think it’s too soon because of the break up and honestly they might be right (my name), you’re the sweetest and super caring trust me when I say that but I know my parents at the end of the day want what’s best for me, and plz don’t hate me but they’re making my brother go with me to the wedding since he’s already gonna be in town, I’m so so sorry I promise its nothing against you, I just know that they’re right maybe it’s best if I do just focus on myself right now and I would have told you this in person but they just told me right now and I wouldn’t want to wait to do that, that’s not right, if you ever want a free coffee though lol you’re more than happy to visit me or come to me with any advice I just need to figure out some things right now I’m sorry.'
I replied, 'Thank you for being honest with me, I could never hate you, I totally understand where your parents are coming from, and I respect your decision to focus on yourself right now, just know that I care about you and I’m here if you ever want to talk or hang out, even if it’s just for coffee, take your time to figure things out, and I’ll be here when you’re ready.' She responded, 'Thank you (my name), I really appreciate that.'
We haven’t texted for a month, but she posted something on Instagram of her at the wedding. When I saw it, it had been up for a few hours. I liked the post but didn’t say anything. Later that night, after work, I noticed she had unfollowed me on Instagram when I checked my profile and saw my follower count had dropped and this happened yesterday and also, she didn’t block me on Instagram.

I sent a pull request on GitHub and someone acknowleded my contribution and that was it. I thought it will get merged and Linus Torvalds will personally say thank you.

I’ve been having a lot of nausea, stomach burning in the middle of my stomach and zero appetite. Today I only ate one meal and coffee. I’m already extremely small and I lose weight very fast. I’m a mom of 5, my youngest is 11 month old. I weigh 117, I’ve already lost 3 pounds and that may not sound like a lot but it is for me. The doctor gave me pantoprazole, I took 3 pills so far and yesterday I felt even worse than before. I got so scared. I haven’t taken anymore. 
I’ve been having heart palpitations here and there, dizziness, foggy and fatigue. 
Also, I’m a cancer survivor. 8 years in remission. I’ve had a double mastectomy and reconstruction. 
I’ve been having severe breast pain in the breast where the cancer was. My shoulder and my neck. Now it’s under my arm. My MRI for this isn’t till the 20th. I’ve had scar tissue and that’s what I’m hoping this pain is. 

Idk if any of it is connected. I don’t want to die. I want to eat and be healthy for my kids and live a happy healthy life. My quality of life is so terrible right now it’s bringing to depression. I’ve had the best life since surviving cancer and all my beautiful babies. I can’t even enjoy them and my life! I feel like giving up. 

All my bloodwork looks good except something called lipase levels, these seemed slightly elevated and I’m waiting on my doctor to call me and talk to me about what those even mean. 
Just as a side note, I know what I wrote is all over the place, sorry about that.

My main goals were to experience a range of ""alternative"" processes, while also experiencing some better roasters.  I do like a sweeter cup with a little more body.  

So far it's not a disappointment.  While I'm not 100% sure the coffees I've tried are worth 2-3x my local roasters,  they do seem more ""refined"" with none of the rough edges and slight harshness or negative flavors I get in most local roasts. This is from B&W red fruits (needs more rest), Dak Coco Bongo (ditto), and 94 Celsius Fruitopop (not pictured - awesome cups every day - roasted 10/2)

 If this is a consistent finding across all 10 bags, maybe the answer is ""yes, it's worth it.""  But maybe it's the processing more than the roasting. Maybe it's a little of both.

I'll probably hit a few more local roasters as I work through these beans, but who knows?  There are just so many awesome beans to try!  I can also see working through as many of the Top 50 roasters as I can manage to develop some personal benchmarks for trying other roasters. Looks like maybe 20-25  could be accessible without breaking the bank.  That could be a fun 2025.  :)

Anaerobics and Co-Ferments have  been hard to find in Pittsburgh.  I'll make sure to leave tasting notes in the weekly threads as I dial-in each coffee.

Yeah, first thing first, I know IATA in this. I have never done this before neither, but I couldn't resist the urge to try this as it kind of give me some insight.

Long story short, I met this girl through a dating app. She was the one who texted me first, with an very energetic opening if I ever see one from a girl on dating app. After sometime talking to her, I found her very attractive, she is pretty, has the same vibe as me, we share many hobbies, and she has a good job and live very near me.

After a day or two, we moved our talk to FB messenger, and here is where the drama begin. She was much less responsive to my messages, as she only replied 2 or 3 times a day. In the first days, I only thought she was busy as it was weekend when we were texting on the dating app, and now it was weekdays. But then I saw her online a whole lot, but didn't respond, so one day, a little frustrated, I took out a clone account and texted her.

On the main account, I was myself, a quite caring and attentive guy as many people opinon. I tried to ask her how was her day, was she still hurt (she had an accident recently), or was she need any help (she often ranted about how the injuries affect her daily life). I also tried to be respectfully and kept the conversation light-hearted, but of course still flirting here and there to let her known I'm interested in a romantic relationship. All of those but all I got was some one liner and sometimes she totally ignored my messages.

But on the clone account, I was super flirty and threw a bunch of foreshadowing, sexual jokes, and be kind of an ass by my definition but guess what, she was way more reponsive.

Yesterday, she texted me on my main account that she was drunk, I immediately call her to ask if she was ok and offered her a ride home. She ignored it and said she missed my call because she was on road and arrived home safety. I was outside having coffee with my friends so we agreed we would call and talk to each other when I got home. But then she totally ignored my messages and calls afterward.

Frustrated, I used my clone account to massage her, pointing out that the frequency of her responds was match with me on my clone account, so I didn't feel reciprocated, so I thanked her for her time and said we should end it here. Then the unexpected happened, she was replying to my clone account massages instantly, almost begged me to try continue to talk with her, said she will miss our bantering very much, and she even show some caring for my clone account this morning asked if I had a good night sleep and how was my morning.

She restricted me on my main account.

I was honestly baffled. She is still texing my clone as of now and I'm not sure if I should tell her the truth. 

Tldr: used 2 accounts to text a girl. On main be myself, caring, light-hearted, on clone, flirty, bad boy vibe. She blocked the main account and try to talk with the clone.

The son came in the next day and asked if everyone had gotten one and we told him that management told us we weren't allowed to have them. He got upset and went to the front desk saying that he had already talked to state or something and they had given him the okay to give us giftcards as long as it wasn't over $25 per person. So my boss said he would hand them back out. We still have not seen a single giftcard and my boss has been suspiciously showing up to work almost every day with a Starbucks coffee

I asked my boss today when we would get the gift cards back and he said that he would be giving them away in a ""raffle"" for our next staff meeting so that everyone would have a chance to get a gift card instead of just carestaff (so like housekeeping, management, activies, and kitchen staff) even though the resident's son specifically gave them to care staff. I don't think it's fair at all, now people who were given a gift card have a chance to just not get one. And people in other departments will get a chance to get a gift card that was not meant for them. 

Idk if I'm just being petty but this doesn't feel right to me. I want my giftcard that I was rightfully given",70,1731377856.0,cna,8,1.0,False

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I’m looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I’m a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I’m very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I’ve mentioned in my post, it’s up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on “hey” or smalltalk responses.

Thanks for reading :). ",3,1731377751.0,r4r,1,0.71,False
1gpa380,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gpa380,jacob’s content before and now,I noticed jake’s vlogs are way different now than before. before he looks like he really post content that he actually loves doing & he’s just being himself. But ofc nat had to control his “aesthetic” so they could match. dragged him to her “coffee addiction” and nat would even decide on what he wears. Do y’all think she controls on what he post too? ,5,1731377679.0,nathalycuevas_snark,3,1.0,False
