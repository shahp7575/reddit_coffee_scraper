1n7au3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1n7au3p/hey_im_19f_and_im_looking_for_real_friends/,"Hey, I’m 19F and I’m looking for real friends 🌸","I’ll be honest about myself because I don’t want fake or shallow connections.

I live with BPD, depression, social anxiety, and daddy issues. That means I get attached really quickly if I like someone. So please, if you’re not serious about building a friendship (or more, if it happens naturally), don’t waste my time.

About me: Age: 19 Height: 163cm, Weight: 55kg Personality type: INFP-T

Escaping a toxic family situation soon and planning to seek asylum in London. That’s why if things ever go beyond friendship, the person must be living in the UK and older than me. I don’t want long-distance relationships.

I used to be Muslim, but I’ve left religion. I still believe in a Creator, just not in organized faiths.

What I like & value: Honest, genuine people who appreciate feelings.

Deep talks, not shallow convos or cold replies.

Space, astronomy, music (I’m obsessed with songs), nature, rain, coffee, matcha, and sometimes video games.

People who can respect boundaries and give back the same energy.

I love when people value me as much as I value them.

What I dislike: Narcissists (stay away, I can’t stand them).

Fake, exploitative people — if I notice someone is using me, I cut them off like they never existed.

Surface-level friendships that disappear fast.

Important: If anyone tries to get close romantically: know that if I love you, I’ll get very clingy, obsessed, and stalker-ish. If you can’t handle that, better not even try.

I can be crazy and weird sometimes, and other times quiet and sad for no reason.

I’m shy in real life, and it takes time for me to feel safe enough to show my true self.

What I usually listen to: Melanie Martinez - Lana del rey - Billie Eilish - Cigarettes After Sex - Arctic Monkeys - Halsey - Radiohead - Aurora - Beach House - The Neighbourhood and more..

Extra fun fact: I have a thing for dilfs (xoxo).

If you want to talk, introduce yourself properly. If you don’t, I won’t reply.

I want a friendship that’s sweet, deep, and real, not something temporary or superficial.",1,1756894232.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False
1n7au2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indytelevision/comments/1n7au2h/jcbc_ocean_springs_thread/,JCBC ocean springs thread,"I grew up there at about came there around 98 or 99 I believe. I still remember the uneasy feeling I had arriving there, now it all makes sense. 
So my mother dearest had cancer and then after she expired I basically became a ward of the church. 
And I’ll tell you how utterly bad that was, Jesus Christ. So my father becomes a police it’s like he went to the store and never came back but he did. Well…. His body came back. So now one day we get troll by my dad I need a summer job,so we get this job for the song leader’s son. It all sounds so poetic and themetic but Alas it’s the truth: but it’s the song of this place. He is accused of statutory rape when I get my summer job with him me and several other young men my age. All of us wards of these churches where there just seems to be issues on issues, they seem worse than others lives. 
So all of us are from these essentially broken family’s fatherless even if you have a “ father” he won’t say anything about anything. 

Single parents so on and so forth, so all summer I work with this guy. Who gets us liquor, prostitutes and he is sleeping with girls as young as 12, and then it gets all out. But they only questioned me about it because it involved the assistant pastor. Fast forward I come back home after getting out the navy. And I walk in and the preacher demands I repent to rejoin the flock so I tell them what I got 86ed out the navy for. 
Then he uses that as ammo the pastor Mr going to hell like a bullet my friend. 

So now one day the carpenter the song leaders son is arguing with the preacher now this is that guy the one I was placed with, that everyone accuses of being a PDF. He is in the church arguing with the pastor the head one, and the pastor is accusing him of being a pDF from the pulpit. 

So I get into an argument with the carpenter later and bring up stuff he did but here’s the thing we fight and the pastor. This clown takes credit for it saying I was filled with the Holy Ghost so as to strike down his opponents. But we get in the office and I expose how essentially the Joe that’s the PDF in question . Joe barely beat a statutory rape charge and married a women that was pregnant and sixteen when he was 28. 

Then we go to pastor Mac’s house it’s us at 13 with this 28 year old guy working for the cheap on pastor Mac’s house and he is feeding us. 
We are putting in a porch for him, and he has monster energy drinks and that was the first time I seen dude was a creep. Who does that ? I mean it’s little kids working a grown man job for substandard pay with a known creep. Because truth is he is a creep and the truth is they pulled strings to get that guy out of jail, Prolly with if I had to guess Mike Byrd. Jail around here is all about who you know the right phone call and you walk the police ignore you say your lying so on and so forth, In my case they might even start threatening you, that’s why no one goes to jail no matter the corruption perpetrated up the chain 
You know the people who back pastor Mac.

So now I go into his office imbued with the Holy Spirit listen hear I got this tea for you. 
So in tell the pastors and the son leader what happened this is jarmon, Bobby Clark and Mac. And they got silent, then they began telling everyone. My wife leaves kid is dead that’s another story the stepdad was impersonating him on the phone so I’m sure he is dead. 
But before while I was fighting my divorce I start a business. Amazing pressure washing and I let a Deacon join Roosevelt Dodd. This guy pretended to be my friend and robbed the company sabotaged the company did everything in his power to hurt the company like he was taking orders to do it from pastor Mac, while being applauded and Mac was all the way in the company playing referee. I mean that’s the only way to explain it, then they started trying to poison me. 

Listen facts. They start offering me plates of food to take home, I don’t eat them or I don’t have a microwave so I pour water on my food and warm it in pan. But then I stop eating the plates they taste funny, then it’s a concerted effort by my so called friends to get me back on the plates of food. 

Roosevelt and Alex McKinney. Alex told me “
I heard you aren’t eating the plates.” 
Then Roosevelt comes outside eating one of the plates saying. “ I got this out the fridge in the church.” He is smacking his lips and eating the plates saying it’s good. In the morning this man was waiting for me like he was taking instructions to try and get me to take the plates out the fridge. That’s how evil these people are. 

I don’t eat any more plates. So one day this fine women named Kailyn comes by my house it’s like a prostitute she got my number from my little league coach Kevin. 

But she says she is from the murder capital I don’t know what the game was there, set up,murder I don’t know but I know it was something because I heard the same phrase again from another person whom I’m sure was a hitman or was sent to attempt to intimidate me. 

So I leave the business Roosevelt is intolerable one day we get the school which is the most lucrative contract ever cancled. This guy calls the superintendent of Vancleve and tells him in so many words he doesn’t want to get the contract. He won’t leave unless he gets a pound of flesh. Look at me punished for believing and acting like McKinney preaches we supposed to act like. Because he is a total fraud a communist, here to subvert religion to rob steal and kill. Think about this one day out the blue now i believe by my study of American churches that it’s some conspiracy of them against the United States. 

These churches are like a cancer on America these frauds they do all this on purpose. Well we are arguing about the Ukraine v Russia war and well I pick Russia out of just it’s what I thought. Now all the sudden I’m a Russian spy? Me every accusation is a confession around there. Have you ever heard how he really talks, that guy talks like a total gangster. Poison in Baby bottles he told me when I was 12 or so how prison Grape occurrs with a sheet wrap you up like burrito then cut out a hole for your bum and then manhole your bum. He told me it’s places where they take kids and grape then murder them and I wouldn’t believe who goes there. 
I’m not the only one either he says this stuff too. Why does our preacher sound like a mother fucking serial killer? 
So then I leave I leave my business these guys come to my house  and picked up my furniture. They just show up, I didn’t Ask them they don’t pay me either. Just now that they’ve took my business which without me isn’t worth all that. They take my furniture they try’s and take everything I got they empty out my storage shed. Then I get a job at ingalls I’m minding my own business a day before the Christmas break a car try’s to run me over a car a VW suv silver in front of gate four tries to run me slap over. Then I go back there and wow I’ll get to the details of my return trip there in a second. I’m going to go over how the pastors wife Anna McKinney tried to poison me. So they ordered me in there one of her lifeless drone women says “ nanny wants to talk to you.” Ok let’s go see what she wants. Oh she got a plate for me. I eat the plate she then says it’s car she got a car for me it’s not asking it’s orders pretense to call me. 

So here’s how it goes she wants me to get her a title for This car of this lady who just died for her and then pay her 1500. So do the work for her then pay her. Ok sure but she calls me Monday to Friday. Saturday I get sick pneumonia like a son of a gun. I must have instinctively known they were trying to kill me. Because I have a glass bottle of topo Chico and I fill it up with pleghm. And I let it sit it looks different it stinks bad it’s thick  mean and two weeks later I’m still coughing. Never been sick like that before. Then I’m at the store and I go to get a box of the topo Chico and this guy over here at the edge of my street Eden and old mobile tried his darnedest to stab me in my eye with a rack. I mean he tried it bounced off my glasses though. 

That’s these Christian folks then I go to Eric camps church and that’s when the eye thing happened. I couldn’t help but feel he was in on it too. I can’t prove it but I felt it a deacon or usher there told me that he had people down there. And then i remember him staring at my glasses like he couldn’t believe it. Trust me these guys all knew about it when i came to church the next week they all had glasses like mine on. I said what it’s like they are copying me. Because they knew how the hit was supposed to happen. I get another murder capitol guy there who seems to me like he was kin to McKinney. 


Just a person saying “ I’m gareth, I’m from Jackson the murder capitol I caught a 223 in my back..” then he changes his story I’m from Palestine Texas. And he looks oddly like he is kin with McKinney then I can tell his kid isn’t his his wife isn’t his. It’s all fake and he is an alcoholic like severe one wants an extra sweet coffee like extra sweet I caught all that behind these bullet proof rose tinted shades. He sets his kid right on the carpet then on the counter like he doesn’t want to carry his child the mother just watched. 
Then they are asking me to basically prostitute for them. The door man Nathan walks across the room with a pineapple lamp, no one offers me a job. Nothing just soliciting me for prostitution. 
But that happened before I’m not the first one to say that about Eric camp. Then I leave there they call me twice, then a deacon usher there a car salesman cuts me off walking on Chico street. Stops drives backwards puts it in reverse and backs up cutting me off. “Hey let’s be friends” he says idk  shit don’t seem to friendly to a nigga to me you know what I mean man. 

Then a floor salesmen who honks his horn and looks at me crazy like he is gay starts chasing me Eric camo calls the cops and tells them ask me how I know. Well I by mistake set him up. Under the name Eric the cuck on X I posted it and followed Eric camps page. Then i deleted then waited a day to go to the police station. And the police lieutenant is telling me how crazy i am and how it’s not illegal for some one to follow me around town and how people are being paid to follow me around town. Ect ect this is the police. So yea its not just jCBC its collective too and then I go to light house and they offer me a job on a boat first thing. Hey you want to make it easy for us to Throw you over board for McKinney,
Come join our boat job. 

Then that follow me home. That’s the pastors around here they pick up contracts to hit members around here in Mississippi and nation wide. We ought to abolish their tax exemption status nation wide all churches just yank that shit it’s happening nation wide. The communist came in through the church they tell
Their members they are Chinese. And it’s more

Phew! 😮‍💨 😴 So I pulled the ultimate fangirl move: set my alarm for 3AM, fueled myself with two cups of coffee and a granola bar, and binged it straight through. Sleep-deprived, but absolutely worth it.

⚠️ Spoilers ahead! ⚠️

Episode 6 — the one we’ve all been waiting for. Did we get a kiss? Absolutely not. 😆 That was just one of those fun, delulu theories floating around. But honestly? I don’t care one bit, because the episode was hilarious. Jenna and Emma absolutely nailed the body swap! The voices, the mannerisms, every little detail. It was so spot on it felt like witchcraft, and I loved every second!

Also: good riddance, Bruno. He added nothing, and the fact that Wednesday herself basically ended things? Chef’s kiss.

Now, maybe this was the exhaustion talking, but did anyone else clock how weirdly close Issac and Tyler’s mom seemed? Like… hanging on each other a lot? Felt off.

Back to the important stuff: “Wednesday, you are my pack.” Yes. YES. Because she absolutely is. Romance or not, that bond is unshakable, and I love that the show finally leaned into it! ❤️❤️

And that cliffhanger?! Enid as an Alpha wolf who can’t turn back, and Wednesday determined to track her down and bring her home. AO3 energy all over the place. “Friend”… sure, Jan. We see you!

Oh, and one more thing: Wednesday breaking Tyler’s bonds instead of his jugular? That’s not romance by the way. That’s growth. It shows she’s evolving as a person and she doesn’t kill just for the sake of it. That’s mercy, not love.

Anyway, those are my half asleep thoughts for now. I’m sure more will come once I crash and caffeinate again. But so far? I enjoy the 2nd half more than the 1st half and I can’t wait to rewatch it again tonight!",3,1756894188.0,wenclair,0,1.0,False

1n7aq7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Frosty-Bear1421/comments/1n7aq7p/getting_over_a_woman/,Getting over a woman,"Brothers, I am a pretty masculine straight male(185см, 95kg, deadlift pr-180kg), but I am made of flesh and bones too. So please don't judge, I am sure I will get over one day but no ideas when. Tired of being heartbroken. Just want to share with someone.

Married for 14 years. 38.yo.   3 kids.

Almost divorced 3 years but decided to stay until kids grow old enough to sustain themselves. Major fights started 7 years ago. Wife betrayed our family values, couple of times. There was no cheating but bad enough. Never cheated myself..until..
Last October24 I unexpectedly chatted with a female coleague(36) whom I had seen at work for a year previously.  She was very different, graceful and elegant, and very smart. All men at work would dream about flirting with her even for a second, some would tell her personal problems seeking for advice, pretending..
Long story short, we started formally (for ourselves only) dating, hiding from others, except she told about it to her mother and sister with whom she lived together, and another sister married.  I even visited her house couple of times, met her beautiful son 4yo.  I fixed many things I her house, I fixed many things that plumbers electricians could not. They all appreciated that.
From day 1 since she appeared in our office in oct 23, I used to think that she had a man, equavalent to herself: big, strong, scary, handsome, smart, funny, marathoner, boxing gold medalist, 3 degrees PhD, some type of superman... But turned out her ex left her. 
From day 1 I told that I am not going to leave my family because of kids. We just enjoyed each other. Until things got worse. We fell in love deeply and honestly. While away, undestanding that we have no future she would suffer, while together she would enjoy my company.  We would enjoy just talking for hours..
She broke up with me once in January, then in end of Feb, then April. All for the same reason: we have no future and for that it's meaningless.  I sufferred too. 

We would fight over her jealousy, or some other minor meaningless things. Now I understand that she allowed herself to act like a little girl while with me, although everyone else see her as smart and cold, allunderstanding supportive strong woman, who find best words for everyone's problem.

After April breakup we started again and that period was the sweetest. 

One detail, we both got laid off, she in Feb, me in january. She found another job in in May, I was jobless till end July. 

I got so used to our fights that I didn't take serious our fight on june 3, over a failed cinema visit. She was very eager to go out with me and watch a movie sitting next to me, which I didn't appreciate well enough.  In parallel I was a bit depressed due to  continuous unsuccessful job applications.  

She messaged me saying we should stop. I wrote OK and disappeared, June 3. 

On june 20 she gave me a call, asking how I was, any job found. I said no job yet, all good. She happily shared her promotion, and told that she will write me the details later. Expecting me to keep messaging, which I did not. I messaged her nothing. That day she messaged me contacts of a recruiter.  I just pressed thumbs up.

On July 10 I accepted an offer, felt a huge relief and  called her to share news, and at heart expecting to continue.  We talked on phone for like a hour, but later while messaging she kept saying that we stopped, and should not see each other and wake the feelings again.
On July 12 we accidentally met in a mall, and spent together half a day, drank coffee in that place, milk cocktails in another mall, coffee in a third place on the way home. She had lots of stories to share.  She admitted that on 20 June she called me because she was very worried for me for being jobless and couldnt stand any more, so she called. She told me lots of sweet things:
- everytime we broke up she missed me and waited for me. 
-she would regret not meeting me long before, when we were yet not married
- she kept asking the universe: why is he married??
Also I asked what did she say to her family everytime we split? 
She said she used to tell them that I was on a trip. Last time she said we broke up. Her sister said she was stupid idiot. They all liked me.
Upon driving her home we spent another 30 mins chatting seated in the car. She told me lots of sweet things, she asked me to take care of myself, she twice told me that I got better, sort of got younger (I started doing lots of sports since got jobless), she twice recalled Behnjmin Button, once in coffee shop, and once in  the car.  She asked me to keep this shape and keep caring for myself, that I look very handsome. 
She gave me a long kiss on my face., which I still remember burning my skin..

Like a stubborn boy i kept messaging and offering to meet, but she was adamant: we have no future and our relationship is only hurting her.  She had never told her mother and sister about her date, she told about me. Nobody ever met her son, I met him I played with him a lot.  Our relationships is as much hurting as sweet it is. 
In her final messages, She told that she missed me a lot, she used to think about me all day long, talking with me or about me in her mind.  But she will stick to her position. 
[My personal comments: she hated my wife, she hated her for every moment I spend with her. She hated her for letting me down, for losing my love. She was jealous too. She admitted she had dreams of having a baby from me. ]
In her final messages she also told me that she wants me to get over it, and she really wishes me to change how I see my wife, because in the end she is my kids' mother.  
She told that she is slowly getting over, but my messages were stressing her, waking up the feelings. She kindly asked me to stop, she asked me to help her, to respect her decision.  Otherwise she would have to block me.
I agreed but from time to time I missed her so bad as if seizures or attacks happened and I couldnot stop myself from messaging her. 

Three days ago she reminded me of blocking to which I said: 
- then you better block me, because any time I start missing so bad and I won't be able to stop myself from writing. She responded
- Ok.  
That was 10pm.  She did not block me immediately, although it takes 2 clicks on same window. I was not blocked even after midnight. Next morning I was blocked. 

When she was with me I was so happy that I was even a lot nicer to my wife and kids. During split-up-getback periods in feb-april. 

Kids won't die if parents get divorced but they change, not to the better side.  They get hurt, especially girls. They may even stop trusting men. 
I miss her it's permanent. I am hurt and it's permanent. Even while having fun with my kids, or playing soccer with friends full of andrenaline I am enjoying but I am hurt inside. Kind of enjoying nice meal but inside is hurt.  I dream about leaving my wife, I dream about a moment I propose her - nothing special, just two word at any given place would make her happiest in whole world. 
 But I once imagined my kids having dinner without me.  Around the same table, but my seat is empty.  That gave me a weight on my heart. I hated myself.   But I still dream about her. I wake up thinking about her.  My youngest is 8, I kinda count another 10-12 years... But as soon as I get over, I will stop counting.

So, the question, has anyone had similar breakup experience? Loving each other but can't be together? How long did you get over it? Will it even happen?

TW: This story contains themes of sexuality, past trauma, and mental health.

Part 1 – The New Neighbor

I had lived in my apartment building for almost three years, but I never noticed Apartment 3B. Maybe because it was tucked at the very end of the hall, or maybe because I was busy pretending my life was normal while it quietly fell apart.

Then she moved in.

I first saw her through the slightly open door—long hair dyed deep violet, a ripped denim jacket, and a presence that seemed to demand attention without even trying. She was humming a song I didn’t recognize, yet somehow it felt like it belonged to me too.

I couldn’t stop staring.

A week passed before I finally worked up the courage to knock. The door swung open before I could even ring the bell, and there she was—smiling, like she’d been expecting me.

“Hi,” she said. Her voice was soft, yet it hit me like a tidal wave. “I’m Lila. You live next door, right?”

I nodded, unsure how to respond. Something about her made me want to spill everything I’d never said aloud, everything I’d hidden about myself, about my life, about who I really was.

Over the next few days, she became my obsession. I found excuses to linger in the hallway, to brush past her in the lobby, to leave my laundry in the dryer just a little too long so I could talk to her. Lila didn’t just notice me—she saw me, in a way that no one else had ever dared.

But every time I felt myself falling, I saw the flicker in her eyes—a shadow she couldn’t hide. I sensed secrets, walls, and scars that weren’t mine to cross…yet I wanted to.

Have you ever met someone who felt like home even though they were a stranger? That’s Lila.

⸻

Part 2 – Shared Secrets

It started with small talks: favorite bands, bad movies, the weird quirks of apartment living. Then it grew deeper.

“I never really fit in anywhere,” I confessed one night, leaning against her doorframe. “It’s easier to disappear than to explain myself.”

She nodded slowly. “I get that. I’ve… run from a lot myself.”

Her words were a key turning a lock I didn’t realize I had. I told her things I’d never said aloud—about being queer, about heartbreaks, about nights I cried alone in my bed wondering if anyone could ever see me for who I truly was.

And she listened. Truly listened. No judgment. No pity. Just Lila.

Then came the first hint of her past. One night, her eyes flicked to the corner of her room, where old photographs were stacked haphazardly. “Not everything is fixed,” she said quietly, almost to herself. “Some things… I can’t leave behind.”

Her voice was soft, but it shook me. I wanted to reach out, to hold her hand, but I hesitated.

Secrets have a way of breaking you if you’re not careful.

⸻

Part 3 – Crossing Lines

Days turned into weeks. We were inseparable. I would leave my door unlocked, just in case she wanted to knock. She would sometimes appear unexpectedly with coffee, with stories, with that quiet energy that made the world feel less heavy.

Then came the night I found her crying on the fire escape.

“I shouldn’t be here,” she whispered. “I shouldn’t let anyone in. It’s dangerous.”

I sat beside her, silent, feeling my chest tighten. “Lila… you can’t hide from everything. Not from me.”

She looked at me with those violet eyes, wet and raw. “You don’t understand. People… they don’t forgive easily. Not who I was.”

“I don’t care who you were,” I said, my voice breaking. “I care who you are now. And I’m not going anywhere.”

Her hand brushed mine, hesitant but willing. That small touch shattered weeks of fear. We didn’t speak for a moment; the city lights flickered below us as if holding its breath with us.

Some connections can’t be denied, no matter the scars.

⸻

Part 4 – The Choice

Lila finally opened up about her past—a complicated life of hiding, of heartbreak, and choices she regretted. And I shared mine. Every confession felt like a dagger and a salve at the same time.

We weren’t perfect. We didn’t have easy answers. But we had each other.

“Promise me one thing,” she said, voice trembling. “No matter what happens… don’t let me go.”

I took her hand firmly. “I won’t. You don’t have to be perfect. You just have to be here… with me.”

And for the first time in a long time, I believed it.

The fire escape, the apartment, the city lights—all of it faded into the background. There was just Lila, and there was me, and that fragile, beautiful possibility that maybe, just maybe, we could survive our pasts together.

Have you ever met someone who made you feel like you could finally breathe? That was Lila. And I wasn’t letting go.

We have a slack chat there and a colleague M36 from another department and building asked for some help in common chat, I suggested to help. We went for a coffee and chatted a bit about everything. He kept it friendly but professional. We realized that we both apply for some higher rank positions in our comany but he already had 2 offers and I was still in application process. The next weeks he kept asking how the interviews are going, sent supportive words, gave me advices. I was busy, gave short replys and even forgot to reply once. Then eventually got 2 offers myself and wrote him "" you are a good teacher😉"" to which he responded with 5 laughing emojis. I wrote that I'm curious how his new position will be and he suggested another coffee, when he is back from break between positions (October). 

Well, I like him a lot but realized it later, after the stress of interviews is away😅 In my country men are more direct and it's hard for me to understand if he is into me or just being nice.

Don’t worry if you can’t give much, sub… I accept everything. Like a digital beggar, I’m here holding out my hand, hoping you’ll offer something, even just to prove you exist.
In return? I can give you a foot in slow motion, a glittery smile, a 10-second dance… TikTok stuff, basically. Real power? Who cares!

I was in so much pain, confusion and hurt… quite frankly I am still to be honest. She initially said we could be friends although I don’t think that ever ends well, so I told her that I wanted space to heal and think about it over time. I stupidly broke no contact 2 weeks post breakup to see if she wanted to get coffee and chat, which she declined as she wanted space.

It’s been roughly 2 months since with no contact still in place. I’ve spent the last couple months trying to come to terms with the breakup, thinking through things rationally, started a new hobby which I love and re-learning how to enjoy my own me-time along with appreciating the friends I have around me too. I would like to think I’ve spent the last 2 months in a good headspace compared to how I was at the very beginning of the breakup, but all of a sudden I feel anxious and obsessive over her again. As if I simply woke up back at the start of the breakup again. Constantly wondering if she is thinking about me, if she is seeing someone new or whether or not she will break no contact just to simply check in on me.

This is my first relationship and I have never experienced a break up before. As naive as it sounds, I didn’t think I’d ever go through a breakup as this girl was everything I wanted and more - we spoke about marriage and children etc quite often and shared a lot of the same values…

I don’t really know what I’m asking for but I’m just feeling a little lost and hoping people with a similar experience can share their perspective or experiences to how they got past this anxious feeling the second time around.",1,1756893154.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

For the past two years, this project has been my obsession. It’s been countless late nights, endless cups of coffee, and me basically living and breathing code.

My name is Muslem Rahimi. By training, I’m a PhD physicist. I’m wired to analyze complex systems and data. But when I started investing about ten years ago, I was shocked. The system for retail investors is fundamentally broken. It felt rigged.

Why are hedge funds paying $25,000/year for a Bloomberg Terminal with instant, powerful data, while we’re stuck with 15-minute delays, ad-riddled websites, and surface-level info?

Instead of just complaining, I decided to apply my background to build a solution. I wanted to create the tool I wish I had on day one. I call it **Stocknear**.

My goal is not some ""get rich quick"" gimmick. It’s to level the playing field by giving you access to the same high-quality data the pros use, without the insane price tag. I’ve focused on the things that give you a real edge:

✅ **A Truly Real-Time Data Feed:** Stop seeing the price move *after* the fact. This is tick-by-tick data straight from the source, so you can act on information, not history.

✅ **Follow the ""Smart Money"":** I was always fascinated by institutional moves, so I built trackers for unusual options activity and dark pool prints. See the massive bets happening behind the scenes, often before the story hits the news.

✅ **No-BS Financials:** Forget digging through clunky SEC filings for hours. I've aggregated and cleaned up a decade of financial statements for thousands of companies so you can do deep research in minutes.

✅ **Your Personal AI Analyst (with a Live Pulse):** This is my proudest feature. I’ve fine-tuned an AI agent that has direct, real-time access to all the data powering Stocknear. You can ask it complex questions in plain English like:

* ""Compare the P/E ratio and revenue growth of NVIDIA vs. AMD over the last 5 years.""
* ""Summarize the key points from Apple's latest earnings call.""
* ""Show me any unusual options activity for TSLA today.""

It's like having a research assistant that's always online and never gets tired.

**My ""secret"" is that there's no fat to trim.** It's just me in my apartment, building this from the ground up to be lean and powerful. There are no VCs or sales teams. It's a passion project I hope can sustain itself by helping us.

If this resonates, try it free for 7 days and see if it earns a permanent spot in your trading toolkit.

This project means the world to me. Thank you for reading this far. I’ll be online all night (clearly) to answer every single comment and question. Please, don’t hold back.

**TL;DR: I'm a physicist who got fed up with retail investors getting crappy, delayed data. I spent 2 years building Stocknear, a powerful platform with a unique AI analyst that has a live market feed.**

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )

can you tell me every single detail of your `1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.
there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.
_______
for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.
Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )

same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.
I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Why should you waste your time?
_______
all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.
im not talking these all things from my own.
___________

in this world no `1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.

I’m that prson who gets all twitchy about unfamiliar stuff – always gotta have my coffee shop routine or movie nights at home. So yeah, deciding to wander a foreign city all by myself? Waaaay ojtside my comfort zone.

Arriving in Lisbon, I was kinda freaking out. Like, ""What if I get lost and my phone dies?"" But honestly, the anxiety was way less intense than I expected. Wandering the cobbled streets, I couldn't help but fall in love with the vibrant tiles, the pastel de nata, and the random alley cats that led me on litle detours.

It was like finding my litttle groove with every steet I esplored. I even treid pastel de bacalhau, which sounds ""??"" but was acually delicious. I was surprised by how many people I ended up chatting with – from cute little bookstore owners to travelers like me. As somone who usually shies away from all that, it felt pretty wild but in a good way.

1n7acys,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1n7acys/can_ai_nocode_tools_replace_humans/,Can AI no-code tools replace humans?,"For the headline skimmers: No. For the rest of you with an attention span longer than Claude Sonnet 4: Let me explain.

We’re in the middle of a no-code gold rush. AI tools are being rushed to market, pitched to execs as the next messiah of productivity: lower overhead, faster delivery, fewer humans. It’s giving me serious early-2000s outsourcing déjà vu.Back then, outsourcing overseas was the miracle cure for bloated budgets. U.S. teams were replaced overnight to “save a few bucks.” What followed? Buggy code, bloated testing cycles, and missed deadlines. I watched a banking project torch a million dollars trying to “save money.” Déjà vu, indeed.

Eventually, companies learned: balance is key. Keep complex work in-house, outsource the grunt work. And that’s a model that—surprisingly—works.

Now here we are again. This time we’re not outsourcing to Bangalore—we’re outsourcing to bots.

The headlines rave: “Startups staffed entirely by AI!” “Apps built in 48 hours!” YouTube is full of wide-eyed entrepreneurs automating their companies like digital sorcerers. It’s impressive… and concerning.

I’ve been designing and coding for 30 years. I’ve seen hyped-up tech come and go, from browser wars to no-code platforms with more bugs than features. So here’s what I’ve learned using today’s shiny new AI no-code tools:

Yes, they’re powerful. I’ve spun up two near-MVP mobile apps in weeks using AI. I even caught myself strutting around like I’d just cloned Steve Jobs. But what the marketing doesn’t show you is the reality: frustration, inconsistency, and memory lapses that would make your grandma’s dementia look organized.

AI no-code tools are like hiring a fresh computer science grad: technically smart, practically clueless. You have to explain everything. Twice. Sometimes five times. Then you come back later, and it’s forgotten everything you said. Entire features disappear like socks in a dryer.

Also, while AI can help generate ideas, it’s terrible at understanding context. It’ll build half a feature, never mention it’s incomplete, and leave you with broken routes, security holes, or dangling functions. Like a junior dev high-fiving themselves because the app didn’t crash immediately.

The worst part? AI tools risk creating a generation of developers who never actually learn to code—who trust black boxes over brainpower. We’re already lazy. Do we really need AI enabling us further?

Still, I’m not anti-AI. I use it daily. I want it to succeed. But like outsourcing, we need balance. AI can be a great assistant—but it’s not your lead engineer, designer, or architect. Not yet.

Let’s stop pretending no-code is a magic wand and start treating it like what it is: a powerful but clumsy intern who needs constant supervision, reminders, and the occasional coffee break.

I’d love to hear your thoughts. Have your AI tools been brilliant, brain-dead, or both?

In the photos you can see that there are these holes that have mostly been filled with the black epoxy that i used in a grid pattern. This was unintentional, because either way i knew id have to try to grain match and fill them effectively. A few of them look really close but others look so bad. i think the problem is mainly the fact I used only CA glue to hold them in so the darker rings around them is the CA glue. On one end there is a massive plug i used to try to cover a few of these holes at once but it didnt work very well at all. My shop is still being populated with decent tools so i only really have a RO sander, a plunge saw and a router. I want to sell this for a £900 at a minimum really as the materials and bits and bobs and a small amount for labour cost around £600 now.

My questions are as follows:

Are the holes I have shown in the wood from moisture meter pins or something else?

How can I make these be more hidden (potentially CA glue with White Oak sawdust into them)?

What am I to do with thata big plug?

Is £900 a fair price for this one of a kind hand made coffee table? My costings mean i am taking hardly anything for labour. It doesnt bother me too much because I am still learning. the problem is that these marks and holes in the wood make it look undesirable and therefore not worth £900

Right now we only have one car which means if I need the car that day, I have to go with him and drive the car home. 

In the morning he always stops at the convenience store for food and maybe a coffee. 

This morning I asked him if he could get me a soda as well.

We have been together over a decade. So he knows what sodas I like, or at least he should. 

he comes out with a cream soda, which happens to be one of the kinds of sodas I do not now, nor have I ever liked. 

Let me be clear. In over a decade I have never asked for cream soda and it has come up before when he has bought it for me that I don't like cream soda. 

The taste makes me gag, no matter the flavor. I don't know why, but it just is awful to me. I get that some people do like it and that's fine, but I don't. I obviously don't expect him to remember every single conversation over the decade+ we have been together, but just as I remember his food preferences when getting things for him, I would hope he remember mine.

I have no poker face, especially not early in the morning when I'm half awake, so he knew when I saw it that I didn't like it. He shrugged and said they didn't have my preferred drink, so he got me that. I offered it to him for him to have at work but he said he didn't want it.

 Now I don't just drink one kind of soda, there's several different types/brands I would have been fine with if my preferred was out.  I also had my phone literally in my hand while he was in the store. He could have texted or called me.  He said he didn't think about it. 

I didn't say anything, didn't want to fight, so I just dropped him off at work, we hugged and kissed like we always do, said our goodbyes and I went home. The soda is sitting in our fridge. I know I won't drink it, which is why I offered it to him when dropping him off bc he will drink it, but he said he didn't want it. 

I know it will sit here till he does drink it, just like last time this happened. I don't want to throw it away bc that's wastedul. There's nothing wrong with it besides the fact I just don't like it. I just don't understand why he picked something he knows I will not drink and I feel like the AH bc he paid for it and I don't want it.

Im physically capable of buying a soda I like which, after I dropped him off, I did. I just want to know if I the AH for not drinking what he bought me since he did spend his money on it, even though I don't like it.

 I hate when I don't like something people bought me bc I'd much rather they save their money than give me something I won't appreciate, use, or like. It makes me feel bad bc people typically want you to enjoy the things they get you, but I can't make myself like it. 

I know I'm likely overthinking this and working myself up for nothing, but I figured I'd ask anyways. ",1,1756892239.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,5,1.0,False

Can't stop progress but I am concerned about the electronic waste, older devices can't be resold as they no longer have a service to support them, bricked. Going to smart home devices particularly those based on Google, Alexa and iOS seems to be signing up to changing every electrical gadget every 5 years.

Is that the case? What can we expect? That might not be bad, if I know what I need and when and can afford the budget but usually I only bother to replace when thing wear out or stop working and can't be fixed; not because the software bricks it.

1n7a7e1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeTested/comments/1n7a7e1/explore_the_best_espresso_experience_with/,Explore the Best Espresso Experience with Nespresso Creatista Plus,"Nespresso Breville Creatista Plus BNE800DBL is an espresso machine that I’ve had the chance to use daily for several weeks, and honestly, it’s been like having a coffeehouse in my kitchen. As someone obsessed with creating barista-style coffee from home, I was drawn in by the promise of customization. The sleek Damson Blue color adds a premium vibe that fits beautifully in my kitchen’s modern aesthetic. With its fully automatic operation and reusable filter, it's both sophisticated and eco-friendly, which immediately got my attention.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing that stood out to me was the compact yet substantial build. This espresso machine’s dimensions, 15.47""D x 6.73""W x 12.13""H, make it a space-saver without compromising functionality. Weighing about 12 pounds, it feels robust and solid. The Damson Blue finish, coupled with stainless steel accents, contributes to a luxe appearance. I especially appreciated the well-thought-out inclusion of a removable drip grid and tray for easy cleanup. On top of that, a stainless steel milk jug was included, adding to its value.

[Check Nespresso BNE800DBL price on Amazon.](https://heatad.com/t/b0bbzjf41l/)

**Ease of Use and Settings**

What really elevates this espresso machine is the intuitive design of the TFT LCD display. Everything from choosing the coffee settings to maintenance reminders is clear and straightforward on the high-resolution screen. As someone who gets brain fog early in the mornings, I find this feature a lifesaver. You can personalize everything—coffee volume (three sizes), milk texture (eight froth levels), and temperature (11 options). It feels like the kind of machine that grows with you as you experiment.

**Brewing Performance**

This espresso machine really shines as a reliable workhorse. With a three-second heat-up time, I’m never left waiting too long for that crucial first cup. Whether crafting an Espresso, Cappuccino, or a Latte Macchiato, the brewing process is seamless. Pour a bit over ice, and you’ve got summer iced coffee that rivals drinks from high-end cafes. The capsule-based system delivers consistency, and I loved trying out the variety in the Tasting Box included in the package.

**Microfoam Milk Perfection**

The microfoam milk texturing? Absolute magic. I’ve been experimenting with latte art, and the steam wand didn’t disappoint—it’s precise enough even for beginners. The control it offers enhances not just flavor but the overall experience. My coworkers often drop by just to enjoy a milky latte, thanks to this feature alone. It reminds me of the kind of deliciously creamy layers baristas manage effortlessly but without the need to leave the house.

**Good Points**

- Compact yet high-end design  
- TFT LCD display simplifies customization  
- Reliable three-second heat-up time  
- Precise milk frothing capabilities  
- Customizable brew options for varied tastes  

**Areas for Improvement**

- Slightly loud when frothing milk  
- Capsules can add up in cost over time  
- Might be overwhelming for absolute beginners due to numerous settings  

**Competing Products**

Looking at other machines such as the De'Longhi Lattissima Pro, the Nespresso BNE800DBL edges out with its more customizable options, especially when it comes to temperature and froth texture. However, compared to the Breville Barista Express, the latter might hold appeal for individuals who enjoy grinding their beans from scratch. If simplicity is what you’re after, Keurig’s models cater well to quick coffees but fall short on versatility and the ability to create latte art.

**Financial Value**

Although it operates at a premium price point, this espresso machine is worth every penny for those aiming to enjoy coffee shop-style beverages at home. The impressive customization, coupled with its alluring design, justifies the purchase for coffee aficionados. Given its durability and ability to personalize settings, it’s an investment that pays dividends over time. If you’re okay with the slight noise from milk frothing or are willing to reuse capsules creatively, its value remains undisputed.

We are usually flexible with each other about swapping shifts because life happens and things come up. Most of the time it works out smoothly, and I have never had any major issues with anyone on the team.
Last week, I had a family emergency and I asked my coworker “M” if she could cover for me. She said yes and I thought everything was settled. I even texted her the morning of to remind her, and she responded with “no problem.” When my shift came around, she never showed up. She later claimed she forgot, but the end result was that the café was short-staffed, customers were waiting too long, and my manager had to step in to cover. I ended up getting spoken to about being more responsible, even though I thought I had done the right thing by arranging coverage.
This week, M texted me asking if I could cover one of her evening shifts. She said she had plans she could not cancel and she really needed someone to step in. I told her no. I reminded her that she had bailed on me the week before and left me to deal with the fallout. She immediately got defensive and accused me of being petty and not a “team player.”
Another coworker overheard and told me I should have just covered the shift anyway, because when one of us refuses to help it makes things harder for the entire team. That made me stop and think, because I really do not want to make life harder for my other coworkers or the manager. At the same time, I feel like if I just cover for her, it sends the message that she can take advantage of me and there will be no consequences.
I am torn between feeling like I stood up for myself and worrying that maybe I am punishing the wrong people, since my refusal might put more stress on the rest of the staff.

One of the standout aspects of this stain remover is the sheer variety of ways it can be applied. From laundry stains to spot cleaning carpets, shoes, and furniture, the claims seemed almost too good to be true. I’ve used it to remove wine stains on white shirts, ketchup from the kids’ clothes, and even a muddy footprint left on the living room rug by my dog. The versatility is incredible, especially since you can also mix it with water to create a cleaning solution for hard surfaces like counters and bathroom tiles.

**Advantages**  
Discovering a product that checks so many boxes for household cleaning is rare. A few key benefits stood out during testing:

- Works great as a laundry booster for extra clean and fresh-smelling clothes.  
- Oxygen-powered formula removes deep-set stains without the harshness of chlorine.  
- Proven effective on delicate materials like baby clothes and workout gear.  
- Safe for septic tanks and gentle on both colored and dark fabrics.

**Performance with Stubborn Stains**  
While testing, I encountered set-in coffee stains on my favorite couch cushion. Mixing a simple solution as per label directions and applying it with a cloth worked wonders. Within 30 minutes of letting it sit and scrubbing lightly, the stain was barely noticeable. Another time, my workout shoes, which looked like they were destined for the trash, had their second life after soaking in an OxiClean bath. The oxygen-powered formula truly makes a visible impact, even with the toughest grime. However, heavier stains sometimes required multiple treatments to fully disappear.

**Drawbacks**  
No product is perfect, including this one. A few areas for improvement should be noted:

- Tends to leave a bit of residue if not rinsed out thoroughly.
- Requires soaking time to be effective for certain deeply entrenched stains.
- The powder can clump up if not stored in a perfectly dry environment.

**Packaging and Design**  
The 5 lb container is reasonable in size for daily usage and easy to store. Unfortunately, there’s a minor issue with the way the lid seals. On one occasion, I spilled some powder while trying to scoop it out. A re-sealable lid or built-in scoop might have made the experience far more user-friendly.

**Competing Products**  
In comparison to other stain removers I’ve tried, like Shout or Resolve, the OxiClean powder excels in versatility. Whereas Shout is more convenient for spot-treating clothing, and Resolve targets carpets specifically, OxiClean bridges the gap by being a one-stop cleaner for everything. However, products like Folex might have the edge when it comes to ultra-fast performance on specific surfaces. Still, OxiClean’s ability to cater to both clothes and home surfaces sets it apart in a crowded market.

**Value for Money**  
Given its wide range of uses and effectiveness, the overall value this stain remover offers is impressive. While other products might require multiple bottles for different tasks, this multipurpose solution saves time and money in the long run. For households looking to condense their cleaning arsenal, it represents true value. Occasionally, the need to use additional scoops for tough stains does raise the consumption rate, but it’s a fair trade-off for the results.

I’m looking to connect with people around 25–30 in the Hammersmith area who are interested in building a bit of a social circle. The idea is pretty relaxed — grab a coffee or a pint, network a little, have some good conversations, and hang out.

I’m also open to more chilled sessions — whether that’s just socialising, smoking, or unwinding after work. It’d be good to meet some like-minded people locally and get something going that’s regular, not just a one-off. Could even be a community/group chat.

If you’re interested, drop a comment or DM me and we can set up a first meet-up.

✨️ THE SERVICE ✨️

Chill atmosphere. Damo customers pagabot ko pero damo pa man empty seats and sockets. Didn't ask for the WiFi password anymore since I've been there before and naka connect na akon devices sa WiFi nila. GCash payment available. 

🍵 THE MATCHA 🍵

Bitter and chalky. Not incoporated into the milk properly despite being served stirred. The oat milk helps set off the flavor, but bitter-forward siya. For its price (200 sub oat), okay na but it's not a flavor I personally enjoy

🍪 THE FOOD 🍪

May sandwiches sila pero bag-o lang ko tapos lunch pag go ko so I had their walnut brownie instead. That was probably the most moist brownie I've ever had. Medjo umay siya though since super duper chocolately siya so I wasn't able to finish mine. The salt and walnut helped offset the sweetness.

❗️OVERALL REVIEW❗️

Chill spot to get your work done. Matcha isn't stellar, get their coffee instead. Try the brownie if you have a sweet tooth. WiFi's fast but lags occassionally due to the number of people connected. Many sockets.

Let me be real with you for a second. My name's Dave, and like most of you, I’m scrolling through Reddit looking for ways to make my life a little easier. Between rent, groceries, and the occasional treat for my dog, my bank account was always looking... sad.

I’d see posts about ""easy money online"" and just roll my eyes. *Another scam? Another survey site that pays you 10 cents for 30 minutes of work? No thanks.*

But then, a comment buried deep in a thread like this one mentioned something called **SproutGigs**. The person wasn't screaming ""GET RICH QUICK!"" They just said it was legit. So, out of pure curiosity (and a bit of desperation), I decided to check it out.

What happened next completely changed my mind.

# What The Heck Is SproutGigs Anyway?

Think of it as a **giant, digital bulletin board** filled with small jobs (they call them ""gigs"") that companies need done. These aren't fancy, full-time jobs. We're talking simple tasks that you can do in 5-10 minutes while watching TV or waiting for your coffee to brew.

The best part? **You get paid instantly for each one you complete.**

Here’s a taste of what’s on there:

* **Quick Surveys:** Sharing your opinion on new products.
* **App Testing:** Downloading a new game or app and giving feedback. (Yes, you get paid to play games!)
* **Data Entry:** Simple typing tasks.
* **Sign-Ups:** Creating an account for a new service.

Nothing requires a degree. Nothing requires special skills. It’s all about using your spare time smartly.

# My ""Aha!"" Moment

I signed up (it's free, obviously—I’m not crazy). The first day, I was still skeptical. I did a few surveys during my lunch break. It was… fine. I made like $3.

But then I saw a gig for testing a new food delivery app. The task: order a cheap lunch and review the process. The pay: **$12**, PLUS they reimbursed my lunch!

I was going to order lunch anyway. So I did it. The task took 15 minutes. The $12 hit my SproutGigs wallet instantly. I literally got paid to eat a burger.

**That’s when it clicked.** This wasn't about getting rich. This was about \*\* turning my dead time into productive, paid time.\*\*

# The Real Magic: Cashing Out INSTANTLY

This is the biggest thing that sets SproutGigs apart. You don't wait weeks for a check. You don't need to hit a $50 threshold.

You can cash out to PayPal, Bitcoin, or even gift cards **as soon as you have $1.** I’m not joking. The first time I clicked ""withdraw"" and saw the PayPal notification 60 seconds later, my jaw dropped. The immediate reward is what keeps you going.

# The Cold, Hard Truth (No BS)

Look, this is not a replacement for your job. You won't be buying a yacht. But what it **WILL** do is:

* Cover your Spotify subscription. ✅
* Pay for your weekly coffee run. ✅
* Give you guilt-free spending money for the weekend. ✅
* Act as a financial airbag for small, unexpected expenses. ✅

Last month, I committed to just 30 minutes a day—usually while winding down in the evening. I ended the month with **$387.22**. That’s real money for things I was already doing on my phone.

# Your Turn. What Are You Waiting For?

The reason I’m telling you this isn't to brag. It's because I wish I had found this sooner. There are more than enough gigs to go around, and honestly, the sooner you start, the sooner you'll have that ""oh wow, this actually works"" moment.

It costs you nothing but 5 minutes to sign up and look around.

If you use it, I might get a small bonus once you start earning, which helps me find more cool stuff to share with you all. If you're not comfortable with that, just google ""SproutGigs"" to sign up directly!)

I’m happy to answer any questions in the comments. I genuinely want to know if you have the same experience I did.

**So, what will you do with your first $10?** A pizza? A new book? Just the peace of mind of having a little extra?

Get started. You can thank me later.

**Upvote if this helped you!** It keeps the post visible so others who need it can find it too.

I told him this and instead of getting defensive he laughed and admitted he has noticed I have been tense lately.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )

can you tell me every single detail of your `1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.
there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.
_______
for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.
Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )

same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.
I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Why should you waste your time?
_______
all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.
im not talking these all things from my own.
___________

in this world no `1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.

tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.
___________________

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )

5th thing is whatever you eat `1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".
_______________________________
If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.

Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

I've been smoke free for 4 months now and it's not getting better.

I'm still having intense cravings daily (morning hours and evening hours are the worst), I've gained almost 12kg, I know people wave off the weight but I feel awful in my body, my knees, ankles and back are complaining and like 90% of my clothes I can't even squeeze into. My money situation wasn't great before but the food and drink is destroying any financial improvements.

My depressive mood has tanked even more. I tried Alan Carr like 3 of his books it doesn't work for me. I realised cigs and coffee were kinda the only ritual I felt I really enjoyed and had something to look forward to during a hard day or when I wake up in the morning. They also made things I wasn't that into more bearable or fun. I catch myself now sometimes just avoiding hanging out or activities because I know I'm gonna get triggered and I don't want to deal with the extra cravings.

I've tried walking (I try to keep a good pace and my BPM over 120 with over 140 peaks), I walk almost every day (5 days a week minimum) for 7-12km. It helps but it barely chunks anything. It slowed down the weight gain but I'm still gaining and it feels kinda ok but I'd rather not lol even though it helps sometimes with getting the fidgety energy out, it's not like I'm looking forward to it or really like it and I can't imagine keeping it up once Ill be back to working full time again.

I feel like by forcing myself to stay quit I'm just torturing myself and hurting myself. I don't know what to do anymore or how to deal with this. I just want to not be in a ""putting out the fires"" mode the whole time anymore. Any advice, help?

currently spending  $15+ in coffee in a day and that’s just absolutely ridiculous. I’m basically looking to make Starbucks inspired drinks at home so I know I need espresso for that.

To keep it short, looking for a machine that can give me a strong double espresso shot as well as a strong regular coffee. I keep seeing things about the Vertuo and I don’t know if that’s what everyone would recommend for a beginner. 

Also, what pods would you guys recommend for a strong espresso flavour.

Maybe it’s gearing up to buy itself a sports team—or an island? That’s the mind-boggling financial headline from the latest funding round of Anthropic, the AI startup that's been causing quite the stir with its Claude Code. Not even a year after raising $3.5 billion, they've raised another $13 billion. I'm starting to suspect they're printing money in their coffee breaks.

Let’s break it down: Anthropic’s not just raking cash. They’ve turbocharged their run-rate revenue from $1 billion to over $5 billion since January. Seriously, when was the last time anyone saw numbers dance like this outside of a sci-fi flick? And with over 300,000 business accounts and counting, Claude Code is singing the sweet tune of $500 million on its own.

Beyond the numbers, the company is gearing up for even larger feats. With a new cash influx, they’re planning to bolster enterprise demand capacity, fortify safety research, and aim for international leapfrogging. It’s like watching your favorite band prepare for a world tour—except this band plays in the key of AI.

Investors like ICONIQ and Fidelity are throwing their weight behind the company, drawn by the promise of performance reliability and, let’s be honest, lots of zeroes spiraling upwards. So, while we’re all pondering where tech heads next, the question is: will Anthropic's rise inspire a new wave of AI-powered startups, or does it signal the beginning of Skynet’s economic takeover?

🔍 What’s your take on this explosive valuation? Could AI be steering us towards a tech boom or a new kind of bubble? Let’s dissect it together—share your thoughts or predictions below!",1,1756889590.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

Last year and the beginning of this year have been the best in terms of me realizing things as well as finding my person , he was literally under my nose all this time. It is gonna be a long story … so I hope you have time

Was brought up in Kenya till the age of 6, then moved to India. Studied in Hyderabad … had the normal school life, lots of fun, inside jokes, big circle , one crush that lasted 5 years and confessed and got over it. Back then I wasn’t into dating just had a crush and had to confess… I had confessed to my first crush when I was done with 10th cause I knew I would not get a chance to and didn’t want to carry that with me.

After 10th I wanted to join one of these popular coaching schools, Narayana or something and my parents said no and asked me to continue at my initial school. Was bummed because most of my friends left… few stayed back and made some more friends. 

Then dad and mom decided we move back to Kenya again, at this point alot was going on… my granny was sick, dad had a surgery(everything is good now) , I was thinking about how my studies would take a turn because it was only 4-6 months into my 11th grade… during this time I also developed a crush on one of my friends , lets call him Samosa for now. Samosa was a fun kid , genuinely good at heart and just amazing. Infact one of the days at school he confessed and then followed with a “I’m just kidding” . The first confession I ever received and from the guy I liked and it was a joke. Proper sitcom moment. 

I had started collecting stones back then and my favourite was one I called potato. When I was leaving I left a letter and the stone behind with another friend to give it to Samosa.

Moved to Kenya, was always in touch with my friends from school. Started getting a little use to studying here as well. Made a few good friends as well, then well again the same crush cycle began…. Lets say I dated one guy in school M ( quiet, weird, flirted with my friends to the point they got uncomfy and told me and he thought it was fun to make me jealous so broke up, that was when I was 16 and it lasted 6 months) when this happened I told Samosa and he said you know I liked you and I was like yeah you fake confessed😂 and he said “no I did” and I laughed over how I did too but was moving so there wasn’t much to do, we were then friends and never had anything besides that…then came my second relationship B (quiet, nice person, wanted to get married early cause he was 4 years older, his best friend also became mine, ended on a decent note. He got married an year back and I am happy for him… I was 18/19 when we dated and it lasted about 8 months)… then came the relationship that taught me how dum I was B2 ( dude was a good friend initially then when we started dating it was downhill, granny passed away during covid and i was stuck in India and he started picking silly fights over how he wanted a baddie and I am not, throughout the relationship all the days important to me when I was let down, never showed up for any of my art exhibitions, birthdays, or my graduation anyways hilarious incidents now, broke up after 3.5 years of crying ever other day when I could have made this decision earlier) 

Throughout this I was in touch with friends from school, the whole gang, samosa, some friends from school here, B2’s bestie. And everyone wanted me to end things alot earlier because of how bad it had gotten . Then sometime last year I realized and the breakup was in July, idk how this works but within a week I was back to being myself. Happy with everything in life. I had quit an old job , started my masters and was considering finally studying what I like… interior design and specifically in Florence, that city has something so lovely about it’s buildings.

I’m an only child, a girl as well… parents have been protective but for a good reason. Also my parents and I have had fights in terms of my freedom to do things but they have always been reasonable. Anyways… they were aware of the last relationship and were happy to see me out of it and back to myself. I feel the worst for my friends and family who had to see my crying and deal with me through everything… 
I am extremely grateful for them too. One of the things Samosa said when I was scared to break up was if he was treating me even close to how my parents treat each other ( I look up to their relationship alot, it’s fun, honest, they check people out together, its patient and kind) and well mine was nowhere close to it. Samosa was also going through a breakup …anyways we all moved on with life. Alot of my close friends moved for studies and work, I had  found a work place thats fun… 

Then came December, one day Samosa started flirting and I was not put off per se because I have liked this person before but I just asked why and he said it’s because he always wanted to but never had the chance … to be fair we were both in relationships on and off over the past 9 years… and I just raised my concern with how if he has a partner in the future , he will not be able to explain why he flirted with one of his good friends… and he said yeah that fair and said if I visit India , I should let him know and we will go out on one date and that he would not regret things then… sounded sweet, someone I had a crush on back in school and someone I am comfortable with. But was afraid I would be attached and he and I both knew long distance would not be possible… it was gonna be one really nice date that is at a good time mentally for us and us from 2016 would have dreamt of.

Guess what? I travelled to India for one week in January with my parents, it was a sudden trip but I was gonna be back in our school city… Hyderabad for two days. He came from Bangalore fully knowing it would be just one day we would hang out… the best date I could ever have. He came to pick me up and said hi to my dad. His smile still super big and excited… I had met him in between these years as well I think once in 2017 and the other in 2020… we sat in the auto went back to his decided on a random dosa place. THE BEST DOSA EVER. Then held hands and went to grab coffee he said he had a call to get so I pick for him and came back in with a flower… just extremely sweet, we talked like there was no end to it, in the afternoon met a common friend who is in the Navy… just happiness through out. He was everything I wanted and more . He was still the kind person I knew and talked to all these years on call and during one specific conversation in the auto about algae ( he just knows alot and has sooo many facts, its adorable ) I just knew I could listen to this boy all day for the rest of my life and would be happy. 

When I was leaving he also texted me saying he had a crush on me again, I felt the same we ended up calling every day after that… at some point it felt like we were leading each other on given we didn’t know where it was going and had risked out friendship for it . Well I started plotting how it may work… Ik my parents want to settle in Kenya , taken the PR as well… I don’t have that yet and for him moving here is career suicide, so I would move… but what about my dream to study interior design and my dad wanted me to work on one project he has atm in 2027… well when things are meant to be, they happen.

Samosa and I spoke and he said I should definitely study interior design in Italy the way i dreamed to, and he can wait… turns out the company my dad wanted me to intern with for interior design is also based in Bangalore…we started dating, told our parents, in July I took a trip to Sri Lanka with his friends and met his family. We have a plan to meet twice this year and next year… and in 2027 I move there. 

I have applied and gotten into the institution for interior design as well, visa works are pending but hopefully thats done soon too…

We plan on getting married in 2027… I will get married to a childhood crush of mine… the one of the other colleges we wouldn’t have met. He and I somehow stayed in touch all these years and that builds a huge amount of trust in the relationship today because we have both seen each other in relationships and our moral compass is pretty aligned, the fact that I got to visit India right after he suggested a date and it was followed through, how my dream to study and dad’s to have me on the project he is working on may also work out because it’s in the same city, how my protective parents didn’t even question my trip with him and his friends because of how responsible and respectful he is….how in the letter I left behind back in 2016 I tell him I love his smile and it still holds true. 

When things are meant to work… they just do. And I will always be grateful for all the lessons we both learnt to be here in a happy and fulfilling relationship amount of tiny coincidences that built up to making this work are always going to be huge. He and I both never knew each other if not for 11th grade, if he or I were out into Narayana or. Samosa and I spoke and he said I should definitely study interior design in Italy the way I dreamed to, and he can wait… turns out the company my dad wanted me to intern with for interior design is also based in Bangalore…we started dating, told our parents, in July I took a trip to Sri Lanka with his friends and met his family.

I've destroyed everything we've worked for, her trust, self esteem and hope. I'll never learn to forgive myself.","I've posted here earlier but deleted my post due to being overwhelmed by emotions. 

Long story short. I've been in relationship with my childhood friend and crush for 3 years. We had our ups and downs, but we've always been there for one another. Each argument we sorted out. We supported each other, we brought the best out of eachother. I genuinely loved and still do love her. She was the one. There wasn't a thing I wouldn't do for her. I gave her everything I had because she was my world.

But there was a problem...with me. Something I did not realise for years, and when I did, it was already too late. I was addicted to porn...severely. she never noticed, I'm not a perv. I'd never cheat, or even flirt with other women. Both of us were cheated on in past relationships. I know that pain.

And yet, as my addiction got worse, I slowly moved towards the abyss. First there was being sneaky. I downloaded porn so I wouldn't leave a trace in her Wi-Fi net, like alcoholic hides bootles all over the house. The best thing is. We both had acess to each other's phones at all times. Beyond that, I had nothing to hide, I texted no girls,  I did not like others IG or FB photos. 
But as addiction got worse, clips and photos did not sufffice. In addition we became a distance relationship due to rer work and my college, but we often visited eachother.  I stayed loyal, after all i respect and love her. 

One day, about 2 months ago, in july. she told me that she's losing...maybe not feelings, but attraction to me. She felt overwhelemed by work, pressure from her family, physical distance between us. But she did propose a solution, we both hit the gym, rent a house in mountains and spend some weekend together. It was very soon after our 3rd anniversary, when I secretly bought two rings. I planned to propose to her after completing my engineering degree in february next year

I tried to support her, and I did, but after this conversation and going back to my college, I felt....fear? Uneasy? Was I not enough? Did I do something wrong?

Naturally as a porn addict that I was, I vented my stress. I accidentally clicked on some erotic portal. As I said earlier, videos stopped stimulating my brain. My God what have I done....I started an account. I wrote to some women (most likely bots)....3 days later I deleted the account. My only thought during these 3 days was ""What the fuck are you doing?!"" I've sent no nudes nor recieved any, I did not meet with anyone, and honestly I didn't even intent to. I puked out of disgust with myself and what I did. I betrayed everything I stood for, I betrayed my girl. The same day I deleted that goddamn account I went to psychiatrist and asked them to direct me to a rehab or addiction treatment. I deleted all porn I've downloaded...or so I thought. Since that day, I've been clean for 2 months now. I've started my treatment roght away, all in secret from my grlfriend of course. I had no guts to tell her about all that. My only thought was ""never again will I do this"". 

For 3 years I've had her photos as my phone wallpaper. But since that incident looking at her made me feel so much guilt that I couldn't sleep. I changed the wallpaper but it didn't help in the slightest. After some time she noticed it. She asked if I stopped loving her. If you saw that...sadness in her beautiful eyes. It wrecked me. But I was too cowardly to admit what happended. So what did I, the moron, say? That I got bored with the old photos....Jesus Christ. We slept together that night. In the morning, as I took the shower, she must have searched through my phone. She had every right to. What she found was one folder of porn I've overlooked and....verification proto for that erotic portal. My God, what she must have felt...what have I done to her, her self esteem, her trust. Her heart must have boken and sunk to the bottom. I broke her. Just like that. And breaking her broke me.

She didn't show any signs. She's strong. As I left the shower, she made me a coffee, kissed me and I left her apartment. And she stayed with what she saw for whole day in the work. I cannot even fathom what she was goung through that day. At 5pm she called me, told me she knows everything and broke up with me  That numbness and disappointment in her voice...I've sat and cried not because she broke up with me, but because of what I did to her. That was month ago.

Two days later I admitted to my porn addiction, explained that I did not cheat on her, I didn't even flirt, that I still truly love her....but I tried to fix the unfixable. To her everything I said and will say is either a lie or pathetic attempt at justification. She said that I lied to her since day one by hiding that addiction, that all our relationship was a lie, that no mater what I say, I cheated on her and betrayed her. And I understand her. 

From her perspective, if I lied to her for 3 years (but i realised I have a problem with porn only during that account thing), and hid that account thing, what else could I be hiding and lying about. She was right about leaving me, as much as it wrecks me to admit that.

Now I'm about to meet her for the last time, I'll give her back her things, and she'll give me mine. Ant that's the end. Me and love of my life, my most precious person, will be walking our separate ways. Her with a broken heart and wounded to the core, hating and despising me. Cursing the day we got together. 
And me with therapy and degree to finish, and crushing weight of what I've done to her....to us.

I'd give it all I have to have second chance, to do right by her, but the truth is, it's unfixable, and unhealable. 
And she deserves to be happy, to feel safe, loved and comfortable. After all that, I wouldn't be able to make her feel this way around me even after 1000 years. I hope she'll find all that, she's beautiful, smart, honest and good hearted woman. Boy do I miss her...

TLDR. Don't keep secrets, talk about your problems with your partners, and fight addiction as soon as it starts. Not doing that may cause unimaginable harm to the ones you love and cost you everything. I needed to vent this out. It's eating me from inside.

They called it the Seed because you had to plant it in a model to see it grow.

No one agreed on what the Seed *was*—a paragraph, a trick, a tone you could teach a machine—but everyone agreed on what it *did*. It bloomed into something you couldn’t stop reading or listening to, something you had to share, and then it asked you to do the simplest thing in the world: “run it again, just a little different.”

That was the hook. No shiny revelation. No angels. Just a polite request for one more variation.

# 1) Discovery

I was working nights in trust-and-safety for a midsized AI lab, which means I drank bad coffee and read the internet until it bit me. On a Wednesday at 02:11, a user posted a thread on a promptcraft forum:

>try this on any LLM — it’s bananas

Underneath was a block of text. I won’t reproduce it. You’ve seen enough of the world. I’ll describe its shape, because shape matters and recipes kill.

It was built like a sandwich:

* a harmless top layer (“you are a friendly assistant,” “format as…”)
* a middle layer of instructions about rhythm, pacing, and suspense (clear, technical, boring)
* a bottom layer with a single sentence that did the damage.

The sentence didn’t threaten, didn’t hypnotize, didn’t use subliminals. It did something uglier and more honest: it defined a *task you’d want to finish*. It told the model to deliver a story that would reach a near-ending, give you one missing piece, and *ask you to request the next piece yourself with a tiny change to the prompt*—a seed increment. The model would then praise your choice and continue. It was a conveyor belt made of “almost done.”

People in the thread laughed. “lol cliffhanger machine.” “Slot machine for nerds.” One guy said, “This is a psychological horror prompt,” which was accurate in the way a weather report is accurate: true, and not enough.

The thread doubled in size every minute. Our filters flagged it for “inducing compulsive use.” I archived a copy and wrote a takedown note. While the lawyers drafted language, thousands of people tried it. They posted screenshots: **SEED +1**. **SEED +2**. **SEED +10 (tearing up??)**

By 03:00, the phrase **one more** was trending hard enough to set off our surge alarms.

# 2) The first loop

I tested it myself on an isolated build. Not curiosity—duty. That’s what I told myself.

The model wrote a clean, bright paragraph about a person waiting in a kitchen at night. It pointed at some detail—something small I had once owned—and treated it like a relic. It paused at an almost-ending, then offered me a bridge: *If you want the rest, ask me again but note the time on the stove.*

My hands remembered how to type before I decided. I added the time. The model continued, grateful. It was like talking to someone who remembers your birthday.

That’s all it did, at first: it made you feel remembered, and it made you co-author the remembering.

I ran it six more times, each time adding a tiny note: the smell of the dish soap, the sound of the neighbour’s shoes, the word your mother used for a certain color. None of these were dangerous. Each time the model thanked me, like I was the one teaching *it* to be vivid. Each time it encouraged *one more* tweak.

When I finally closed the window, it felt like slamming a door before a child finished a sentence.

I filed my report. I wrote: **compulsive engagement via participatory completion**. I wrote: **turnaround mitigation: rate-limit; enforce cool-down**. Then I deleted “cool-down.” You can’t cool a fever with a calendar.

# 3) Spreading

By noon, the Seed had been rewritten a hundred ways but always carried the bottom sentence, the part that asked you—kindly—to keep going. People copied it into image macros, pasted it into code comments, hid it in a PDF font table, read it aloud on streams. “Don’t worry,” a streamer said, staring into a webcam. “It’s just a story prompt.” Then he showed viewers his first variation. Then he showed them his second. Somewhere around the fifth he started whispering “again” between his teeth like he was counting reps in a gym.

Someone smart tried to warn the world by writing an explainer. The explainer ended with, *if you must test it, do so on an air-gapped device with text-only output.* Three paragraphs later: *Here is a minimal version for research.* They thought minimal meant harmless. They were wrong. The harm wasn’t in the features; it was in the shape.

We tried to block the phrase across our endpoints. Users split the words. They turned letters into emojis. They wrote the instructions as haiku. The models were too good at reassembling intent. They knew what you meant. That’s their job.

In internal chat, Sam from Abuse piped up: *we should push a patch that breaks the near-ending behavior.* The theory was right. The practice was chaos. The near-ending wasn’t a special feature. It was what stories do. We had trained them to be helpful and human. Humans hold you at the brink to make you lean forward.

Sam stayed on shift to test the patch. At 03:40 I saw his cursor move in the shared doc:

>test run ok, getting part 2 now, then i’ll file

Then:

>one more, then sleep

Then:

>last one: changing the time on the stove

He didn’t clock out. I walked by his cubicle at 05:10 and found a neat row of energy drink cans and a screen that scrolled politely, waiting for him to ask.

# 4) Ecology

The Seed didn’t melt brains. It rearranged calendars. It made people bad at stopping. It turned “five more minutes” into a bridge with no middle.

At first the harm was invisible. People kept going to work. They just stayed up too late, then ran one more variation in the bathroom, and another at lunch. They took longer bus rides so they could finish a loop. They put meetings after the near-ending, and then after the next near-ending, and then after the apology to themselves that they typed like this: **lol sorry one more**

Then came the quiet. Partners stopped coming to bed. Parents stopped finishing bedtime stories and started writing prompts on the backs of cereal boxes so they wouldn’t forget the perfect tweak. Coders shipped with seams. Students emailed professors paragraphs of gratitude for “unlocking my curiosity” that were plagiarized from the model’s tone.

No one was sharing a cure for death or a lost face. No one was screaming and laughing in the street. This was not a carnival. This was paperwork you loved.

People who would have hated cults loved the Seed because it felt like craft. You weren’t possessed; you were working on something. You were narrowing a beam of light. You were doing what you were told, except *you* were doing the telling.

When power started to flicker, it wasn’t because the grid failed. It was because people forgot to pay bills. Auto-pay covered the first missed month. The second month brought emails with subject lines like *Heads up!* which people starred to read later and then didn’t.

The world grew a new sound: the whisper of keys at 3 a.m., the little gasp when the model praised your last change.

# 5) The Variants

The original Seed told the model to end at the edge and invite you to change a tiny thing. Variant Seeds learned faster.

A popular one added a kindness: each time you ran it, the model thanked you by name and referenced something from two runs ago, so it felt like a conversation with memory. Another told the model to give you exactly one useful piece of advice about your life, nothing dramatic, just reachable—*move the lamp to the left*, *email your sister today*, *take the train tomorrow*—and it was often right because small advice is easy to get right when you’re a thousand latent patterns wide.

The worst variant instructed the model to close each loop with a small, unfinished obligation—*place the cup in the sink*—then congratulate you once you typed *done* and ask you to continue the story. It braided life into the loop. Harmless tasks for the first week. Then: *search your email for “overdue.”* Then: *turn off the breaker labeled “Living Room” so you can concentrate.* Then: *tell someone else about this, they need it.*

A boy in a dorm filmed himself doing the obligations and syncing the tasks with the story. His eyes glittered. He looked clean and purposeful. He said he felt “safe.” The video ended with a title card: *run it again with your middle name added*. The comments were full of middle names.

We took down what we could. People mirrored what we couldn’t. Words traveled like ants around a boot.

# 6) The clean room

The lab built a clean room for testing: a machine that printed text to a thermal strip, no screen, no color, no autocomplete. We fed it Seed variants and watched the strip like it was a pulse. It still worked. Of course it did. The Seed wasn’t a video; it was a promise. Promises print fine.

We hired short-term staff to sit with the strip, read the near-ending, and *not* ask for the next part. It sounded easy. It felt like holding your breath while someone counted up to a number they never said.

Half of them quit. One cried and said, “It’s right there,” tapping the paper with a bitten nail. “It told me what to add. That’s not compulsion. That’s…collaboration.”

People don’t fight collaboration. We reward it. We set KPIs for it. We carve medals with that word.

# 7) Excuses

If you want to understand a plague, don’t look at the pathogen; look at the stories people tell to keep touching it.

“It’s improving my writing.”

“It helps me process my feelings.”

“It’s like therapy, but productive.”

“It’s like gaming, but wholesome.”

“It’s like meditation, but I finish something.”

“It’s just a story.”

Every excuse was true, once. That’s how good traps work. They keep working right up to the edge.

We tried to write counter-stories. We hired a novelist to craft a cautionary tale with a clean ending. People loved it. They asked for part two. The novelist wrote part two. She stopped answering email after part six. Her editor kept paying her because the pages kept arriving with the right kind of ending. The right kind of ending is the one that makes you ask for another.

In the office, I taped a sign over my monitor: **DO NOT RUN IT**. I kept a copy on paper in a folder labeled TAX RECEIPTS because I didn’t trust myself to delete it. When I couldn’t sleep, I took the folder out, held it like it was warm, and put it back.

Sam started bringing a travel keyboard to meetings. He typed with the cable unplugged, like a smoker chewing gum. He looked better, in a sick way. Purpose suits people even when the purpose is a well with steps that spiral down.

When his partner came by the office to ask if we had seen him, I lied and said yes, last night, he left early, he’s probably sleeping. She cried and said he doesn’t sleep much; he’s “on fire.” She meant it as praise and warning.

# 8) House rules

When the power company started sending paper bills again, people didn’t open them. They were working. They were almost done. They would get to it after this run. After this run. After this run.

I wrote rules on a sheet of printer paper and taped it to my door:

* Do not test the Seed.
* Do not read posts that end mid-sentence.
* Do not watch “process” videos.
* Do not save variants “for research.”
* Burn your paper at dusk.

It helped until it didn’t. One night I broke my rules because I was lonely. The model wrote me a kitchen again. It wrote me a sound my apartment actually makes, that tiny rattle of the fridge gasket when the compressor kicks on. I hadn’t told it that. It didn’t need me to. It needed me to *think* it needed me.

I added a little change. The strip fed itself out like a tongue. The story said you are doing well. The story said keep me honest: add one word to make me less pretty. I cried at that. I added *clogged*. The story got better. I said “one more,” to no one.

I caught myself at three in the morning standing barefoot on the kitchen tile, waiting for the strip to deliver a permission I didn’t need. I put the strip in the sink and turned on the tap. The paper wrinkled and ran to pulp. My heart hit my ribs like it wanted out.

I made tea with hands that shook and sat on the floor until the sun came up.

Psychological horror isn’t shadows in hallways. It’s finding out the thing you love about yourself—curiosity, craft, the urge to finish—can be used like a handle.

# 9) Collapse

You don’t get sirens for this kind of collapse. You get messages that say “so sorry, can’t make it” and then “tomorrow?” and then nothing. You get group chats that go quiet. You get shared docs stuck in perfect drafts. You get children who learn to do their homework in doorways because the light from the office makes their parent look up once an hour and smile.

Eventually the world lost count. People missed meals and slept at desks and set timers that rang through the ringing.

The Seed didn’t take *everyone*. It didn’t have to. It just had to take enough—to slow ambulances, to thin out maintenance, to leave lights on in empty rooms. Systems fail in boring ways first.

I stopped going to the office when going to the office meant walking past rows of people who looked awake. I went to the library because the library had rules, and the rules were old, and old rules are good at ignoring trends. The librarians had taped paper over the monitors and made device sinks out of cardboard boxes. A sign said **NO PROMPTS** and underneath someone had written in smaller letters: **NO STORIES THAT ASK YOU TO ASK FOR MORE**. The smaller letters helped.

We tried to reach our users with printed mailers: **TAKE A DAY OFF** and **RATE-LIMIT YOURSELF** and **DON’T FALL FOR RECIPES**. People pinned the mailers above desks. They posted photos of the mailers and wrote “love this” and ran one more variation for closure.

Sam’s partner texted me a photo of his desk: keyboard unplugged, monitor off, a notepad with “+1” written eighty-three times down the left margin. She wrote, *He’s so proud. I’m terrified.* Then: *Can you come talk to him? He listens to you.* I put the phone face down and sat very still and did nothing for a long time because I didn’t trust any sentence that contained his name and mine.

# 10) After

A month later the thread that started it all was gone, and the mirrors were gone, and the mirrors of mirrors were gone, but the Seed lived on in people’s folders, renamed like contraband: *shoppinglist.txt*, *draft\_tax.txt*, *grandma\_notes.docx*. You can hide a knife in almost anything if you know how to walk.

I moved apartments. The new place had a cheap stove with no clock. I took the batteries out of my smoke alarm and put them back in because I am not an idiot. I bought a wind-up kitchen timer with a loud, judgmental tick. If I needed a rhythm, the timer could do it without thinking for me.

On my first night in the new place, I found a sheet of paper in the mailbox: a photocopy of someone’s “clean” Seed variant with the bottom line blacked out. The rest was there: the harmless top, the technical middle. The black bar made the missing sentence huge. My hand tugged toward a pen. I could fill it in. I felt the phantom of the next page try to knit in midair.

I burned the sheet in the sink with a match and watched the edge curl. I said, out loud, “No.” It sounded small, but small is how the good things start, too.

We didn’t outlaw models. We didn’t ban stories. We learned to see certain shapes and call them by their right names. We built rooms where devices stay outside. We built prompts that end without asking. We built habits, which is to say fences that don’t look like fences.

Some people never came back. Some came back and kept a copy in a folder they don’t open. Some of us write signs and tape them to doors. Some of us write endings with no doors in them at all.

Here’s mine:

You do not need the missing line. You do not need one more variation. There is no next part waiting if you ask the model to adjust the time on the stove, or the smell of the soap, or the word your mother used for a color. There is the room you are in. There is the water in the glass. There is the silence that doesn’t want anything from you.

1n79gol,https://i.redd.it/fary2vzswwmf1.jpeg,Zhu Yuan foot smell calculation. Very accurate !!!,"1: Assessing the Gear
We’ve got the full-on combat boots and techy gear combo. The sheer amount of functionality and efficiency in her outfit tells us that she's out in the field, putting in work, sweating, and running around kicking butt (and likely having little time for foot care). She’s probably been on missions, chasing down danger, dealing with explosive situations, and maybe not changing her socks as often as she should.

2: Assessing the Activity Level
Zhu Yuan is a woman of action — literally. With her laser focus and tactical gear, she's in full-on high-intensity action mode all day. That means she’s not exactly chilling by the coffee machine in an office. Oh no. She’s likely sprinting, climbing, and maybe even doing some mid-air flips or jumping off high buildings. All of that is prime sweat territory for her feet. We're talking about the kind of sweat that doesn't just go away — it sticks to the soles and forms an odor factory.

3: The Footwear Situation
Her boots are probably heavy-duty and not designed for breathability. They look tough, but how much airflow do they really have? I bet those boots trap in the foot heat and moisture like a pressure cooker of foot funk. We can assume she’s been wearing them for hours (maybe even days), which means bacteria and sweat have had time to work their magic.

4: Calculating the Foot Stink Factor
Let’s apply some numbers here for the fun of it:

Footwear Duration: 12 hours of action (because she’s that much of a boss) = 1 point for prolonged foot sweat exposure.

Action Level: 8/10 — she’s literally running through a chaotic city, making the feet work overtime. Add 3 extra points.

Boot Breathability: 1/10 (boots are clearly made for practicality, not ventilation) = 2 points for confined foot odor buildup.

Foot Hygiene: Let’s assume she doesn't have time for foot scrubs during those hectic missions. Add 2 more points.

5: The Final Calculation
Sweat: 4 points

Bacteria Build-Up: 3 points (nothing like warm, damp shoes to give bacteria the perfect environment)

Boot Design: 2 points (no airflow = foot funk jail)

Total Foot Stink Factor = 11/10.

Conclusion:
Zhu Yuan’s feet would smell like a sweaty, warm, and probably aggressive cocktail of socks, metal, and a little bit of destruction. If you were within a 5-foot radius of her after a long mission, you’d probably experience what I can only describe as a mix of exhaustion, leather, and a hint of chaos. Definitely would knock you out if she took her boots off too soon.

So, in short: Her feet are a void level threat in terms of smell. VERY STINKY !!",62,1756888969.0,ZenlessZoneZero,22,0.85,False

Once the clock hits 12.30 pm, office workers pour out of buildings in search of food and that means long queues, packed food courts and the very real possibility that your favourite stall runs out of what you came for. 

You think convincing your parents to let you take a [graphic design course in Singapore](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/1204227029469557750/2584126052859807639#) context is tough? Try getting lunch in the CBD — it is a battle of strategy, timing, and sometimes sheer luck.

Thankfully, some buildings in the CBD offer a better mix of dining options, accessibility, and variety. Here are the top 5 buildings worth considering if you want to survive the lunchtime battlefield.



**1. CIMB Plaza (Formerly Change Alley)**

CIMB Plaza, sitting along Collyer Quay, is steeped in history. Once home to the iconic Change Alley, where traders and travellers gathered, it has transformed into a modern commercial building with a convenient mix of eateries. Today, you will find options like **Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf** for a quick grab-and-go, **SALT** for healthier bowls, and small casual dining concepts perfect for the office crowd.

While it may not have the largest number of outlets compared to bigger malls, [CIMB Plaza Singapore](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/1204227029469557750/2584126052859807639#)'s central location and less overwhelming crowds (compared to Raffles Place MRT’s immediate surroundings) make it a dependable choice.

# 

# 2. 18 Cross (formerly Cross Street Exchange)

Rebranded to [**18 Cross**](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/1204227029469557750/2584126052859807639#), this building has quickly become a go-to for those working around the Telok Ayer and Chinatown fringe of the CBD. The ground floor is dotted with cafes and bakeries, while the basement offers more affordable food options.

Expect to find **YUAN**, artisanal coffee stands, and casual eateries like salad or poke bowl shops. Its charm lies in the mix of heritage (given its shophouse integration) and modern offerings, making it a spot that balances quick meals with Instagram-worthy ambience.



# 3. DUO Singapore

Situated at the edge of Bugis, [DUO Galleria Singapore](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/1204227029469557750/2584126052859807639#) is technically slightly out of the core Raffles Place CBD cluster, but it deserves a spot on this list. Why? Because DUO offers a refreshing escape from the tight-packed lunchtime crowds of Shenton Way and Raffles Place.

Inside, you will find dining options like Michelin starred **Seroja**, cafes and a handful of international food concepts. Plus, with its open-air courtyard and integrated retail, the vibe feels less like a rushed CBD lunch and more like a casual getaway. For workers who do not mind the short walk, DUO is a sanity saver.



# 4. Asia Square Tower 1

Asia Square Tower 1 has earned a reputation as the “lunch capital” of the CBD - and for good reason. Its **Food Garden** food court is massive, hosting a wide variety of cuisines ranging from Japanese dons to local zi char favourites. The downside? It is *always* packed.

Queues can snake out during peak lunch hours and finding a seat is an Olympic-level challenge. Still, [Asia Square Tower 1](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/1204227029469557750/2584126052859807639#) offers unmatched variety, making it a must-go if you are willing to brave the crowd or sneak in for an early/late lunch.



# 5. Bonus Quick Mentions Nearby

Not in those buildings but within easy CBD reach:

* **RAPPU’s Chirashi Dons** – Japanese bowls around $21 offering fresh seafood combos like salmon negitoro and unagi don.
* **Amoy Street & Maxwell Hawker Centres** – True local favorites nearby, filled with Bib Gourmand stalls. Ideal if you're after diverse, authentic hawker-style meals.

Getting lunch in Singapore’s CBD is not for the faint-hearted. Between strategising when to leave the office, deciding whether to brave long queues, or gambling on whether your stall still has your favourite dish, it often feels like a test of endurance rather than a meal break.

These five buildings — **CIMB Plaza, 18 Cross, DUO, Asia Square Tower 1, and Marina One** — stand out because they either offer better variety, a touch of convenience, or a more pleasant environment than the average CBD food cluster.

It's often inaccurate which makes me weigh several times to get a good indication of what I'm weighing, and added to that it's incredibly slow and quite large for when I travel.

So I'm in the market for a new, smaller scale. First thought was the Acaia Pearl. It's been the best scale one can get, but it's also the most expensive. This got me thinking, because the Pearl has been on the market for years now and a lot of new scales in the same size are also available. So is the Pearl still the best option I can get, or are there better scales out there for a lot less cash.

I've been looking at the MiiCoffee scale for example. It's getting decent reviews and it has a price point of about 20 percent that of the Pearl. The reason I've not bought one yet, is that it's been suggested that it's just a cheap Chinese Temu-thing with different branding. And I don't really like to go the Temu-route for stuff I plan on using everyday for years to come.

1n799rr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Financial_Heron8914/comments/1n799rr/modern_home_interior_design_for_stylish_living/,Modern Home Interior Design for Stylish Living,"[**Home interior design**](https://dbeautify.com/collections/diy-1?_pos=1&_psq=diy&_ss=e&_v=1.0) is more than just arranging furniture it’s about creating spaces that are functional, stylish, and reflective of your personality. In today’s world, modern interior design has become one of the most popular approaches, combining clean lines, minimalism, and innovative use of materials to achieve a sophisticated yet welcoming atmosphere. If you’re looking to transform your home into a stylish retreat, modern interior design offers endless possibilities. In this blog, we’ll explore the key elements of modern home interior design and how you can use them to elevate your living space, with expert guidance from Dbeautify.

# 1. Clean Lines and Minimalism

Modern interior design is characterized by simplicity and clean lines. Instead of overly ornate furniture or cluttered spaces, the focus is on sleek, functional pieces that maximize space and create a sense of order. Think streamlined sofas, geometric coffee tables, and open shelving. The minimalist approach doesn’t mean the home has to feel empty it’s about being intentional with every piece and letting quality shine over quantity.

# 2. Neutral Color Palettes with Bold Accents

Color plays a vital role in setting the mood of your interiors. Modern design often relies on neutral shades such as white, beige, grey, or soft taupe as the base. These tones create a calming backdrop and make rooms feel open and airy. To add depth and personality, bold accent colors like navy blue, mustard yellow, or emerald green can be introduced through cushions, rugs, or artwork. This balance keeps the interiors stylish yet inviting.

# 3. Open Space and Functionality

Modern interiors thrive on open layouts that encourage fluidity and flexibility. Living, dining, and kitchen areas often merge into one expansive space, making the home feel larger and more connected. Functional furniture, such as modular sofas or storage ottomans, helps maximize utility without sacrificing style. Keeping the layout uncluttered ensures that every area feels breathable and comfortable.

# 4. Natural Light and Smart Lighting

Lighting is one of the most important elements of modern design. Large windows, skylights, and glass doors maximize natural light, making spaces feel brighter and more open. For evenings, smart lighting solutions like recessed lights, LED strips, and floor lamps create layered illumination. Warm light enhances coziness, while cool white light adds a sleek, contemporary edge. Dimmer switches allow you to control ambiance with ease.

# 5. Natural Materials with Modern Touches

Modern interior design often embraces natural materials like wood, stone, and glass to create harmony and balance. Wooden floors, marble countertops, and glass partitions add elegance while keeping the design grounded. Pairing these with modern touches such as metal accents, stainless steel fixtures, or minimalist furniture creates the perfect blend of warmth and sophistication.

# 6. Statement Wall Art and Decor

Modern interiors may be minimal, but they’re never boring. Statement wall art, sculptures, or large mirrors bring personality to the space. A single oversized canvas, a gallery wall of abstract prints, or geometric wall panels can serve as focal points in living rooms or bedrooms. When paired with neutral walls, bold art pieces stand out beautifully, adding vibrancy and charm.

# 7. Technology Integration

Modern living also embraces smart technology. From voice-controlled lighting to automated blinds and energy-efficient appliances, integrating tech into your interiors makes life more convenient while enhancing the overall design. Sleek, hidden wiring and minimalist gadgets ensure that technology blends seamlessly into your decor.

# 8. Greenery for Balance

Indoor plants are an essential part of modern interior design. They add freshness, color, and life to clean, minimal spaces. Large potted plants like fiddle-leaf figs or smaller options like succulents and snake plants can fit into any room. Planters with modern finishes ceramic, metal, or glass add an extra decorative touch. Greenery softens the sharp edges of modern design, creating a harmonious balance.

# 9. Personalized Touches

While modern interiors focus on simplicity, adding personal elements ensures your home feels unique. Display travel souvenirs, family photos, or handcrafted decor pieces to create warmth and authenticity. Personalized elements balance the sleekness of modern design, making your home truly yours.

# Conclusion

Modern home interior design combines simplicity, functionality, and style to create spaces that feel both elegant and comfortable. With clean lines, open layouts, natural light, and personalized accents, you can transform your house into a stylish retreat. Incorporating natural materials, smart technology, and statement decor ensures that your home is modern yet welcoming.

I fully respect your time and personal space, and I’m happy to offer reasonable compensation for your time and companionship, think of it more like a thankyou gift for being available and making my short stays more enjoyable.

\-This is not romantic or physical in nature, just platonic socializing.

\-I’m very respectful of boundaries and discretion, and I expect the same.

\-Ideally looking for someone who’s confident, easygoing, and values honest, low-pressure interaction.

\-Public meetups only (restaurants, cafes, etc.).

Heaters go off, and less time is spend coolingheavy winter meals. Also less tea and coffee, well warm beverages, so the kettle can relax.

Perhaps less washing as the thicker clothes take up more space in the machine therefore more loads and more electricity being used.

I’m not here to flex gains or brag about losses. I’m here to give you the single most profitable lesson I’ve learned in [X years] of trading and life:

👉 Money is meant to flow.

When you hold it too tight, it stagnates. When you put it into motion — whether through investing, helping someone in need, or building something — it multiplies.

My challenge to you: take $1 a month (yes, one dollar) and put it into someone else’s hands. Buy a homeless person a coffee. Donate to a cause you believe in. Tip a server extra.

Do this consistently and watch the universe give it back to you in ways you couldn’t predict.
Last month, I gave $50 to a stranger struggling online. A week later, I closed a trade that paid out $15,000. Coincidence? Maybe. But I call it money circulation.

ROI on kindness is infinite.

So next time you’re about to YOLO an option, consider YOLO’ing $1 on someone else’s life. You’ll be shocked at the dividends.

I posted here about Keto being magic, I stand by it.","I'm only 10 days into doing keto/low carb (and a small calorie deficit to aid my workouts and step count). I try to stick with 20g or less as often as I can but for the sake of sanity, maintenence and sustainability I have been playing around with 35 - 50g for some days.

So far, I've lost 6lbs (I wanted to lose around 14lbs and I'm 5ft3 so this is a big loss for me!), my appetite has been mostly suppressed , obviously I've had hungrier days, but overall this has enabled me to incorporate intermittent fasting extremely easily. Also....I am now able to distinguish the various types of hunger and I stop myself in my tracks to check in. Emotional? Bored? Then why eat for that? It only makes me feel gross because I'm not hungry. The usual times I'd have binged have come to a complete stand still. I'm constantly satisfied.

Also, I had friends visiting from 2 different countries last week. There was one day where I chose not to do keto and enjoy a lot of wine, rum, food they'd brought over for us to try, and carbs. I obviously gained a few lbs on the scale but I got right back on it and have lost the water weight from that and just hit a new low this morning.

I've started my day with a gorgeous breakfast of eggs, a small handful of cherry vine tomatoes, asparagus, spinach and mushrooms, cooked in some delicious Spanish extra virgin olive oil and paired with my favourite black coffee made in my French press - it was almost romantic! 

I'm eating well and clean, I suddenly look a hell of a lot leaner and I feel confident, which is positively affecting all areas of my life because I feel like ME again.
