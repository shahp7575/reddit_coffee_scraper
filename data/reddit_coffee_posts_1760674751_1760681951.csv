There were some things that caught me off guard but I decided to say fuck it. She seems nice and pretty cool. I got nothing to worry about. Anyways, I got to the coffee shop and we ordered coffee and food and we sat for a bit. We then decided to walk around some nearby green space for a bit and we had normal conversation for about 10-15 minutes. I was then legit interrogated for the next 35-45 minutes about my dating history, why I got the app, who I went on dates with, how the dates went, why the dates didn't work out, who these people were, and what my relationship goals are (tbh I think this one is fine for a first date). This is what made me decide *Yeah nope. I'm not doing a second date.* Mind you, she already pressed me about these questions the over text on more than one occasion (I gave clear but simple answer). I honestly felt very uncomfortable because, as I said above, why I got the app is information I only share to close friends, not people I just met. Let alone what happened on my previous dates. And plus I already gave an answer on more than one occasion so I didn't understand why I was being asked again. During the rest of the conversation my brain just went into survival mode. I also was sent some really strange memes the night before we went on the date that made me uncomfortable (like sex memes. mind you we've been texting for five days atp). We haven't texted each other since the date. I want to get advice to make sure I'm not overreacting because I tend to make things out to be worse than they actually are. I wasn't feeling it so I'm 100% not going on another date but I want to make sure it's not just me being crazy. ",2,1760681673.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

1o8to2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1o8to2p/neighbor_keeps_accidentally_wandering_into_my/,"Neighbor keeps ""accidentally"" wandering into my backyard and I'm losing it","So I've lived in this house for about 8 months now. Nice quiet street, decent neighbors, or so I thought.



There's this guy two houses down, we'll call him Mike. Mid-50s, retired, way too much time on his hands apparently. Started off normal enough. Waved when I moved in, helped me carry a box once, whatever.

Then like a month ago I'm sitting in my backyard having coffee and I hear my side gate creak open. I look over and there's Mike just... walking through. Says he thought he saw a cat run back here and wanted to make sure it wasn't stuck. Okay weird but fine I guess?

Week later I'm grilling and he does it AGAIN. This time the excuse was he was ""checking the fence line because he thought he heard it rattling in the wind."" Bro what. It wasn't even windy.

Last week I came home from work early and caught him literally standing on my back patio looking through my kitchen window. When I confronted him he got all defensive saying he knocked on the front door and nobody answered so he ""came around back to see if I was in the yard."" 

I told him to stop coming into my yard. He acted like I was being rude and said he was just being neighborly.

Then YESTERDAY I'm working from home and I see him on my Ring camera. He opened my gate, walked around my yard for a solid two minutes just... looking at stuff? Picked up one of my plant pots and looked under it. Tried my back door handle. 

I went outside and he jumped like I'd caught him doing something. Said he was ""making sure my sprinklers weren't leaking into his yard."" His yard isn't even next to mine there's a whole other house between us.

I told him if he comes on my property again I'm calling the cops. He said I was overreacting and that ""this is what neighbors do.""

Is it? Because I'm pretty sure normal neighbors don't just wander into your yard multiple times a week with increasingly weird excuses. My girlfriend thinks I should install more cameras. My buddy says I should just put a lock on the gate but I feel like I shouldn't have to?

I don't know what this guy's deal is but it's creeping me out. Anyone else deal with something like this?

So I’ve been using dating apps to go out and meet people and for these people to drive me around the city and show me their favourite places. Because it’s unnatural to me to just go up to someone and ask to hang out, and with my circumstances it just happens to work out. I learnt i really liked this coffee shop, and I like to hike more from going on these dates! They don’t really go anywhere as I don’t usually hook up and I’m quite shy, but it’s really nice to learn little parts of the city I never would have known, places people like that I never would have tried.

I am not causing harm or leading these people on I am also there with the intention to meet someone and am also clear to them about me moving and stuff, however it has been so fun? Like going to play tennis, going hiking, going to these cafes I never knew existed. I’m not going on many btw, but the few I have been I’ve learnt so much about myself as well and I can talk to people a lot better! I also think I’m going to sign up for tennis where someone took me because I got exposed to it, know how to drive and really liked the coaches! I never would have thought!

1o8tn73,https://i.redd.it/j1v6ovsr5mvf1.jpeg,Can money really double in twenty-one days or is it just a fantasy? Read My opinion,"A WhatsApp message my cousin sent last summer  “Bro, invest here, and your money will double in just twenty-one days!” I laughed at first. But then, somewhere in my head, a small greedy voice whispered, What if it’s true? That’s how most traps begin with curiosity wrapped in hope.

I’ve seen those ads everywhere lately. They’re kind of addictive, you know?

Back in January, I met a guy at a café who swore he’d turned ₹10,000 into ₹20,000 in three weeks. He talked fast, smiled confidently, and kept using words like “algorithm,” “insider updates,” and “auto-trading.” His enthusiasm felt contagious almost believable. But when I pressed for details, everything sounded… fuzzy. No real company name, no verifiable proof, just screenshots and promises. A week later, his number was unreachable. That coffee felt bitter that day, even though it wasn’t the café’s fault.  

The truth? If money could really double that fast, banks would be out of business, and everyone would be millionaires by now. Genuine investments stocks, mutual funds, gold, real estate take time. Compounding works, but it needs patience, not magic. I learned that painfully after losing ₹5,000 to a crypto plan that claimed absurd growth. It wasn’t a huge amount, but it stung mostly because I ignored my gut feeling.

Sometimes people know it’s risky but still jump in. It’s that tiny thrill of “maybe this time I’ll beat the system.” I get it I’ve felt it too. But let’s be honest, overnight success stories are often edited highlights of someone else’s long grind or pure luck.

Even during festivals like Diwali, when markets are buzzing and everyone’s talking about new beginnings,  I remind myself fast money often leaves faster. Real wealth builds quietly, like the slow rising of dough before baking. You don’t rush it, or you ruin it.  

In the end, doubling money in twenty one days isn’t just unrealistic it’s fantasy wrapped in sales language. What can double, though, is your awareness if you pause, research, and question what sounds too good to be true. Because sometimes, the smartest investment is in saying “no” before excitement drowns your logic.

My space café

Amid the sands, these aren’t just coffee spots but full spaces of contemplation. my space café in sharjah is built from mirrored pavilions reflecting the sunset and campfires.

Sadeem café

Near the al qudra lakes in the al marmoom reserve is sadeem café, whose name means “nebula”. It looks like a sci-fi movie set: glowing arches, campfire smoke, and large round seats under neon lights. Tourists sip pistachio coffee or matcha latte while watching the first star appear on the horizon. In spring 2025, louis vuitton held a fashion pop-up here, turning the coffee spot into an art space.

Hubara hills cafe

Another serene spot is hubara hills café on the al qudra lake shore, where you can drink coffee and see flamingos. This place draws those seeking quiet — minimal lights, lots of air, and soft lighting in the evening. The menu ranges from classic latte to truffle foam cappuccino and fresh desserts.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Hanshin Tigers vs. Yokohama DeNA BayStars: A Tale of Clutch Claws and Rookie Nerves**

The Hanshin Tigers and Yokohama DeNA BayStars are set for Game 3 of the Central League Climax Series, with the Tigers clinging to their 3-0 series lead like a toddler with a ice cream cone. But don’t let the scoreline fool you—this isn’t a coronation. It’s more of a “please don’t trip over your own shoelaces” moment for Hanshin, who need one more win to punch their ticket to the Japan Series. Let’s break down the numbers, news, and why this game might play out like a rom-com where the Tigers already know they’re the leading man.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Tigers Purr as Favorites, BayStars Fumble with a New Remote

The betting lines paint a clear picture: Hanshin is the favorite, with decimal odds hovering around **1.75-1.82** (implying a **55-57% chance to win**). For context, that’s about the same probability that your morning coffee will survive the commute unscathed. The BayStars, meanwhile, are priced at **1.95-2.12**, which gives them a **48-52% implied chance**—roughly the odds your gym membership will finally get used this year.

The spread is **Hanshin -1.5** (odds: -150 to -175), meaning bookmakers expect the Tigers to win by *at least* two runs. But let’s be real: Hanshin’s offense has the clutch gene of a cat that’s always one step ahead of a falling piano. In Game 2, Shōta Morishita drilled a walk-off homer in the 10th inning, proving that this team thrives in “just one more chapter” scenarios.

The total runs line sits at **4.5-5.5**, with the over priced slightly lower than the under. Given that Game 2 featured 8 combined runs (including a rain delay that probably refreshed the players’ spirits), the under might be a snooze—but let’s not count out a team with Hiroto Taima on the mound. The Tigers’ ace has the ERA of a fortress (1.82 this season), while Yokohama’s rookie starter, Yuta Takeda, is about as battle-tested as a toddler’s first steps.

---

### News Digest: Tigers Have the Edge, BayStars Are on a “Do or Die” Road Trip

Hanshin enters this game with momentum, having clawed out a 5-3 extra-innings win in Game 2. Their lineup? A well-oiled machine with Morishita leading the charge. The Tigers also get to stick with Taima, who’s as reliable as your local barista’s 7 a.m. opening time.

Yokohama, on the other hand, is pinning its hopes on **Yuta Takeda**, a rookie who burst onto the scene like a TikTok trend—suddenly, unpredictably, and with zero instruction manual. Takeda’s regular-sea

I have a bit of a scattered background and am not sure how to approach my job search or translate it to a resume. Since I graduated I've done freelance audio gigs trying to 'make it' as a sound designer or audio editor, while working a day job as a supervisor for a large coffee chain. After kind of losing the plot for these last few years after Covid and not really knowing what I was really working towards, I decided it was time to get my ass in gear and get a more financially stable/interesting job, maybe stepping back from creative endeavors for a while. After doing some research I landed on IT as a good fit because I have a technical background due to my STEM degree, long time interest in breaking/fixing computers, and coding/software through my gig doing game audio. I am looking for entry level IT jobs I can then specialize in down the road. 

I live in a city with lots of media companies and doing IT for one would also be a cool way to do something I'm naturally inclined to in a creative sort of environment even if I'm not doing what I originally set out to do (sound design), although in the immediate term I'm really willing to take whatever role gets me some foundation of direct IT experience. 

What I'm wondering is if there's a better way to approach the resume then just throwing it all down like this. It feels very unfocused and irrelevant? But not sure if that's just me. Does any of my journey come through in the resume? I feel like I'm 7 years too late to be on track for anything.",1,1760680567.0,resumes,1,1.0,False

My husband and I have known each other about three years and got married last year. We even went to the same middle and high school and talked before we started dating. He’s extremely loyal — he shows me love every day, tells people about me, and avoids anything that might upset me.
I need advice for myself. He has a girl best friend he’s known since high school and they’re very close. While we’ve been together he hasn’t spent much one-on-one time with her. Lately, though, I’ve been feeling really jealous. During our first year of dating we went through a lot and took breaks. On one of those breaks he told me he’d been meeting his friends and she was there; they talked for hours and “sort of caught feelings,” and he told me on the phone that she’s a very beautiful girl. They had liked each other in the past.
Now we’re back in our hometown visiting family and friends, and he’s been getting coffee with her and going to Bible study. He says it’s only friends, and I trust him — but every time her name comes up I think about the past and how he said she’s beautiful, and it hurts. I know it sounds silly, and I understand he might find other people attractive sometimes, but it’s different because she’s his best friend and they’re close.
A few days later he came back from seeing her and said she told him they can’t hang out anymore — out of respect for me. He was really hurt because it feels like he’s losing a best friend. I told him it was okay and that I don’t want them to stop being friends, but the thought that he finds her attractive still tears me up inside.
I don’t know how to handle these feelings. I want to be humble and trusting, but it’s eating me up. I need help — any advice would mean a lot.",2,1760680258.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

Alright, so you wanna buy or sell a place in Calgary and gotta pick a realtor, right? Dude, there are SO many agents around (seriously, just search RECA, it’s wild). But you want someone who actually gets you, not just some rando chasing commission.

# 1. What You Actually Want in a Realtor

* **Is your realtor legit?** Make sure they’re licensed with RECA. You want someone who isn’t just some cousin working part-time—full-on pro! Most decent ones are with AREA or CREA too.
* **Knows the ‘hoods** Like, if you want a condo in Beltline or a house in Tuscany, they need to know the area cold—what’s selling, what’s not, and what’ll actually hold value. If your agent’s never even been to your part of town? *Hard pass, man.*
* **Track record matters** Look for people with happy clients—ask for recent deals, legit reviews, or even hit up your pals for a referral. My friend went with an agent who had like one review. Rookie mistake.
* **Actually responds to texts** No ghosting! If you’re texting about an awesome place in Altadore, you want answers ASAP—not tomorrow.
* **Chill, honest, no pressure** Calgary’s market moves fast, but your agent shouldn’t push you into sketchy deals. If they’re not 100% upfront, bounce.

# 2. Questions You Gotta Ask (For Real)

* “How long you been doing this in Calgary?”
* “This your full-time gig or just side hustle?”
* “Got references from people who bought/sold here recently?”
* “Which areas do you know best? Can you show me proof?”
* “How do you keep me in the loop? Slack, WhatsApp, smoke signals?”
* “What’s your negotiation game—pitbull or puppy?”
* “Do I get you or your team? Who’s actually there at showings?”
* “How do you market a place? Got any examples from, say, Killarney or Varsity?”

Add ones that matter to you, but straight up, if they dodge these questions, walk.

# 3. The Moolah—Fees & Stuff

* Most charge between 3% and 7% commission (buyer/seller agents split it up)
* **Seller usually pays, but ASK. No shocks.**
* “What does that pay for?”—If it’s just a sign and a listing, forget it. You want pro photos, open houses (with Tim’s coffee or something), staging, the works.
* Ask if commission is flexible (especially these days).
* “Are there any sneaky extras?”—Like admin, marketing, whatever. Trust me, ask.

# 4. Sketchy Stuff—Red Flags 🚩

* Won’t give references or past deals (seriously?)
* Zero clue about local market—like, calls Mahogany “new” when it’s been around for years
* Late replies to questions
* Pushes you to sign ASAP, doesn’t care if you’re ready
* Weird fees—like super cheap or way too high, with no reason

Have you seen anything sketchier? Tell me—I’ve got stories for days from buddies who nearly got burned.

# 5. Deciding Who’s Your Realtor

Meet at least a couple agents. Grab coffee at Analog on 17th, chat with them, see who vibes with you.  
Don’t just pick the first person your aunt recommends unless they really get what you want.

**Quick Calgary Checklist**

* License and creds? Check.
* Knows your area? Check.
* Good at talking and answering? Big check.
* Fee structure clear? Yep.
* Don’t ignore your gut—it’s usually right!

I previously tried cutting back or quitting in order to help improve those but always relapsed really fast. The insomnia should be reason enough, however in the last 2-3 years I have had drastic thinning of my hair and it wrecks my self esteem on a day to day basis. I checked thyroid levels but they came out normal and so did blood status. I've tried so hard to seek out any other explanation for the hair fall than caffeine, but last night it just clicked, I need to stop kidding myself and give this an honest chance. 

I am struggling A LOT to visualize not having my daily 2-3 coffees or at least the first one in the morning. I tried previously to replace with tea but I never took a liking to it. 
It's 7 in the morning and I'm dreading this, and it's also creeping me out a bit that I feel this way about coffee. But I'm sure I'm not the only one.

Heres mine.,"I’ll list down some flea markets I’ve been to and I also wanna know your guys’ thoughts cause I might not be the only one noticing these things 👀

Benta Benta (by L.M.)
Probably the most well-known “high-class” flea, but tbh it doesn’t really live up to the name anymore. The vendors are always the same, most of them friends of the organizers. They always say “we support local,” but it feels repetitive. A year ago it was super relevant, but now? The vibe just feels awkward. No crowd, no activities, just quiet.

Clasico Events
Run by four people who are all kinda known in the scene. I’ll be honest though, their events are pretty good! They’re great at picking and curating their merchants. The only issue is the whole situation where they didn’t properly settle with a venue—kinda unprofessional. But overall, solid event organizers.

Club Market (by W&D)
All I can say is… you guys might be overdoing it 😅 every month there’s a flea, but it feels rushed. The spaces are always tight, marketing isn’t that strong, and it ends up feeling more like quantity over quality. Been to a few, and I kinda wished I went somewhere else. Also not the most accommodating team.

Hey, Market!
So cute and family-friendly!! I actually love going here, but yeah, the space can get really tight and overwhelming. Also noticed some similarities with other event brands 👀 maybe time for a new design direction. Still, really fun and good energy overall.

Tropa Ocaso Events
Chaotic but fun. I’ve been to all their events and I always end up having a good time. They’re creative, have fresh ideas, and actually try to make flea markets feel exciting again. Some say they’re “not professional,” but I think they’re just younger organizers who enjoy what they do. At least it’s never boring (and free shots help lol).

La Nueve
Went once, it was okay. Nothing bad, just didn’t stand out much. Their coffee is great tho.

Likhang Lokal
Their first event was really nice and I like their videos a lot. But they can be a bit unaccommodating sometimes. Also heard things about them talking bad about other organizers which isn’t cool. Still, their branding and content are always on point.

ga.la events
Super chill and calm vibe which I like! Just wish there were more activities or interactive things going on. It’s nice but can feel a bit plain.

365 Common Ground
Marketing was great, I won’t lie. But the actual event didn’t match the hype at all. The vibe felt off and I heard some merchants weren’t treated that well. Merchants literally make the whole event happen so that’s disappointing.

The Clubhouse
Haven’t attended yet but from what I’ve seen online, a lot of their stuff looks very similar to other existing markets. Hoping they’ll come up with something more original when they finally launch.",6,1760679876.0,davao,4,1.0,False

In japan, the early history of tea in Japan is not well understood. Anyway it (matcha: powdered green tea) came from china around 700s or 800s and spread among the nobility and clergy. And it was abandoned, or continued only in a meager way. Is 1190s, it came again from china. Basically it was drunken as drug, but it became to sadou or chadou. Sadou or chadou was spiritual way first, but it spread among nobles, samurais, and civilians, and they use Sadou as politics, socializing, and art. Oda Nobunaga romanticized Sadou and drove up the prices of tea tools like Pokémon cards or vintage whiskey. His vassals sometimes requested tea tools rather than domain as their reward for battle.

While Edo period, people start drink green tea (odcourse came from china too) and matcha and green tea spread among citizens. In Meiji period (late 1800s), Sadou became females' etiquette. High or middle class families paid money for their daughters studying Sadou. 

From Meiji period to now, 'new' drinks came in from world, like black tea, coffee, and others. According to my observing, people used to prefer warm black tea or black coffee, but recently drinking habits have varied. By star backs for example. Today, people drink green tea in hot or cold without sugar, drink black tea in hot or cold sometime with sugar or milk. Coffee has most ways to drink. Drip, espresso, instant, cold brew, siphon, in cold, hot, with sugar, milk, soy milk and others. Now, convenience stores povide most low priced and delicious machine brew coffee.

1o8t55e,https://i.redd.it/xh1ye0cd0mvf1.jpeg,NEET / IIT-JEE Preparation Plan for a Student,"One chilly December morning when I scribbled “IIT-JEE” on the top of my notebook, right beside a coffee stain that never faded. It wasn’t just another test name it felt like the beginning of something uncertain but strangely exciting.  

It’s scary at first.  

I used to wonder how people manage to stay sane while balancing classes, coaching, and a dozen mock tests every week. Honestly, what kept me from burning out was breaking those massive goals into smaller, human-sized tasks. Like deciding, “Okay, today it’s just Organic Chemistry till dinner and nothing else.” It sounds simple, but that little decision kept me going for months. I made a crazy-looking timetable once pink sticky notes for Physics, blue for Maths, green for Biology pasted all over my wall like some kind of artistic chaos. Every time I checked off a topic, there was this weird satisfaction, like ticking off a life mission.  

Some days, though, it all crashed. There were mornings when my head just refused to cooperate. I’d sit with a cup of tea from the small stall near my coaching center in Kota, watching kids busily solving papers, and I’d think, “Man, am I the only one stuck?” I wasn’t. Everyone feels that way at some point unsure, exhausted, lost in revision loops. But that’s the trickiest thing; you’ve got to keep showing up even when things aren’t clicking. Those silent nights before tests taught me something consistency beats intelligence when it comes to NEET or JEE.  

Trust me, it’s not about studying 14 hours a day. It’s about how smartly you use the 6 or 8 you actually study.  

For NEET aspirants, short daily review sessions help a lot revising diagrams, NCERT lines, and typical “trap” questions. For JEE, I’d say prioritize problem-solving over passive reading. Practice is your real tutor here. Set a timer, mimic the exam vibe, and make every test count.  

And please, don’t let guilt chew you up for resting once in a while. Some evenings deserve to be lazy. Go for a walk, talk nonsense with your friends, eat pani puri it’ll reset your brain better than any motivational reel. My biggest mistake early on was treating breaks like sins; turns out, they’re part of the strategy.  

Honestly, preparation for NEET or IIT-JEE isn’t just academic it’s emotional training too. It teaches you patience, discipline, and how to stay calm when your hands tremble before the result screen pops up. Looking back, I realize the journey itself mattered more than the rank.  

And if you’re starting now, breathe. That’s where every topper once began.

I’m single/not actively dating and have realized that many of my closest friends are in the thick of parenting young kids or navigating new relationships, so I’m looking to expand my social circle a bit more. Would love to connect with some folks with a bit more free time and some similar interests!

I’m a former New Englander who moved to PDX about a decade ago. I love being outdoors - especially hiking, camping, gardening, and mushroom hunting (tis the season!!). I’m also into volunteering, live music, and trying new coffee shops/restaurants. I did recently adopt a teenage pup who’s been a bit of an attention hog, so dog friendly hangs are also a plus. 

If any of that resonates, feel free to reach out! Would love to plan something (and frankly would love an excuse to stop doomscrolling so much 😅). ",2,1760679464.0,PortlandFriendMeet,0,1.0,False

It has now been 17 days since I've started my 90 day gaming detox and it's been really good so far. Really productive.
For years I kept talking about how I want to start a novel, and never ever got around to do it because all of my free time was filled with gaming (my second favourite hobby was books, though games always won). And now I'm writting every single day and all I do is either read or write! It finally feels like the life I am supposed to lead.
The thing is, I keep wondering about the moment my detox stops. Do I go back to games? Do I just stop completely? There are some great games coming (like Wolverine, GTA VI etc.) and I am having a little FOMO about them.. also there are games that give me the feeling of returning home from abroad or something, real comfort games (Skyrim, Borderlands 2, Minecraft) and it makes me sad to think I will never visit them again. 
It's also really hard for me to hear about gaming around me, how people are enjoying it casually, when I know I am unable to do so. My gaming always turns to addiction. Just the other day, I've spent the whole day wandering around my town, stopping here and there for a coffee and either read or write. I wrote over 2k words, my new record! It has been such a great day, and I know that If I had the opportunity to play a game instead, I wouldn't have left the couch..

So basically, deep down I know the answer, I just need someone to tell me how it is. All of my friends and family think gaming is harmless and that I should not quit completely, but I would never be so productive with games around..
Maybe have only one game at a time installed? Or maybe play a little once my book is finished? I don't know.

1o8t22s,https://i.redd.it/rj599rugzlvf1.jpeg,Spiced Mocha ☕️ 😋 [protein],"One of my favorite and on-repeat creamis is mocha flavored, but recently I ran out of the instant coffee that I normally use. I decided to try our Arabic coffee instead (think Turkish ground coffee but with added cardamom) and this is an absolute winner. I have the deluxe but don’t fill it up all the way, scale this to size! 

Ingredients: 
- 6 grams Arabic Coffee Grounds (or instant coffee with ground cardamom to taste)
- 14 grams chocolate collagen powder 
- 50 grams monkfruit sweetener*
- 20 grams cocoa powder 
- 1/4 tsp guar 
- 1/8 tsp xanthan 
- 150 g 2% milk (I use aldis fairlife dupe)
- 400 g unsweetened vanilla almond milk 

Steps: 
- Bloom cocoa powder and coffee grounds in boiling water. 
- Combine dry ingredients in separate bowl
- Milk in the pint, add cocoa powder/coffee/water mixture, and dry ingredients. 
- Immersion blend 
- Let sit in the fridge for a few hours 
- Into the freezer for 24 hours 
- Spin on lite ice cream** scrape down the sides and pat down with a spoon, spin on mix in. 

I topped it with some dark chocolate biscotti thins and so chefs kiss! 

Notes: 
* I use a combination of 15 grams allulose/monkfruit and 35 grams erythritol/monkfruit because once I accidentally found out it gave me the best texture and spoonability after refreshing. 
** I find that the setting I use really varies. If I store the pint in the freezer closer to the door it doesn’t freeze nearly as hard and I can use sorbet or even normal ice cream. But for this one I had it stored all the way in the back which I guess is the coldest, and when I did the scrape test it needed the lite ice cream. This is all to say that the setting you use will be specific to you and your freezer! So scrape test and go along with that :) 

Macros (yes I know collagen protein isn’t complete but it’s best texture wise and just eat protein elsewhere if you can 😊)

***Thursday***

“I really don’t want to talk about him,” Boyd said, tensing as if to stand.

Robbie reached for his knee and gave it a squeeze. “For me?” he asked, knowing exactly what to say to slip past the big guy’s defences.  “I’m the only one here, man. No one else is here listening in.” He could only hope that was true. Or if they were there, they’d take this huge hint to leave.

Boyd eyed him suspiciously, then gave in and slumped down in the seat, his neck catching on the headrest as his feet stretched out over the coffee table. He hadn’t gone as far as to cross them at the ankle or fold his arms with a huff, but it was a really close thing.

Robbie settled low enough to rest his head on Boyd’s huge shoulder. “He’s wrong,” he said, slowly threading his arms through Boyd’s to stop him from going anywhere. “We all know he’s wrong.”

“Buuuuut…” Boyd drawled stubbornly.

Honestly, how did someone go from being his pillar of strength one moment to a petulant child in the equation the next? “Buuuuut,” Robbie repeated, ending the word on an up note instead of the hard stop that Boyd had used. “He’s your best friend outside this apartment. I mean, with the way we all treat each other like extended family, he’s probably your best friend, period.”

“Not anymore.”

“You know you’d be exactly the same if your roles were reversed.”

Boyd’s grunt and the way he looked at the wall away from Robbie were almost comical.

“Seriously. He was one hundred percent wrong in his approach, but he only did it because you mean the world to him. Six months ago, you would’ve defended him if someone on the job site was picking on him, wouldn’t you?”

“I wouldn’t have done what he did.”

“Because he’d have pushed back and probably come out on top in those fights. But what if he hadn’t? What if he was just a regular guy hanging out with a couple of other regular guys, and half the night crew attacked them for being gay? Where one was killed, one ended up in ICU, and the only reason Larry got out with minor scrapes was because *you* got there in time to stop them from really hurting him.”

He saw Boyd’s jaw twitch along with the muscle in his arm, telling him the picture wasn’t sitting well with him.

“Now picture him insisting on going back to work on that same night shift, because the main troublemakers were fired. Not all of them. Say the biggest four were fired. That still leaves all the others—waiting for an opportunity to finish what they started.”

Robbie lifted his head to meet Boyd’s eyes. “Are you going to sit there and tell me that you wouldn’t become his permanent shadow from then on? Or panic the second you realise he’s not where he’s supposed to be—because what if they’ve already pitched him off the fiftieth floor?”

Boyd rubbed his bare feet together uncomfortably. “He has to pull back. I can’t be around him if he’s going to hover over me like that.”

“What if I have a word with him? Get him to agree to a sit-down with you. One where I’ll act as mediator. We’ll talk instead of yelling. Are you willing to do that if I ask him?”

\* \* \*

*Say yes…please, please say yes.* Lar’ee mentally begged from where he clung to the ceiling above them as a harmless housefly. His ‘date’ with Eva had been wonderful, but she was still an elderly lady, so their trip down memory lane had been briefer than he would’ve liked. Still, it had worked out in the end—Robbie had chosen tonight to go on an international shopping trip, and Lar’ee followed him into every store.

Which explained why Sam’s pair had snickered when Robbie mentioned the unlikelihood of international ICE sitting around the next corner—because it wouldn’t have mattered with Lar’ee shadowing him.

Of course, he had to keep ducking back to check on Boyd since no one else was keeping an eye on him. Not by being in the same room as he had last night, though. After giving Robbie his word that he would stay away from Boyd, he had remained in the hallway outside the apartment, shifted his vision to thermal and relaxed when Boyd was still exactly where he was supposed to be.

Fortunately, the other true gryps gave no indication of his presence beyond a light jab or two from Rubin about being whipped. They were too young to understand. Kulon now came the closest, but even he hadn’t crossed the threshold into why things were so knotted up in Lar’ee’s mind … not for the lack of trying. Mason was smart enough to not go there.

Lar’ee held his breath as Boyd’s jaw worked for furious seconds. He promised them both he’d try to do things differently from now on if the big guy agreed to this sit down. Yes, he’d embarrassed Boyd with those police officers, but that had never been his intent. He’d just received the biggest fright of his life, and he’d reacted on instinct—like any warrior would, when faced with that kind of fear.

“Fine, but this is the last straw. I mean it, Robbie. If he doesn’t get his head out of his ass and truly change, we’re done.”

“Wait here. I’ll see if he’s got a minute.”

Lar’ee realm-stepped into his apartment downstairs and threw on whatever clothes he could find. Jeans. T-shirt. Done. His phone rang just as he zipped up his jeans and launched himself at the charging cradle. “Yeah?” he asked, determined to keep the excitement from his voice.

“Boyd’s willing to talk, but please, hear me when I say this is your last hail Mary of a chance. He’s really on the brink of ending his friendship with you.”

“Do you want me to come upstairs?” he asked, pretending he hadn’t heard every word they’d said. “I’m in our apartment at the moment.”

“Yeah, come up to the hallway. We’ll go in together. Keep me between you. And don’t lose your temper again—no matter what he says. Not even a little.”

“Thanks, Robbie.”

“You both need each other, man. Don’t mess this up.” Robbie hung up, and Lar’ee pocketed his phone and realm-stepped into the hallway outside Boyd’s studio. Robbie was already waiting for him. He scanned Robbie’s face and realised he must have run himself through a demonic stimulation wave in the few seconds he was away. Everything from his hair to his complexion was flawless—no trace of the red, puffy eyes or dishevelled hair from a few moments ago.

“I can hear your heart beating from here,” Robbie said with a half-grin.

Lar’ee appreciated the attempted levity, even if it did fall a bit flat. “Are you sure he’s good to go?” he asked.

“He’s promised to hear you out on the condition you use your inside voice for the duration of this chat. No shouting, or it’s all over. Okay?” His eyebrow arched, in case the warning wasn’t clear enough already.

Lar’ee nodded, nervously dragging his lower lip through his teeth.

“Alrighty-then. If it gets too much, start a mental mantra of ‘last chance’. It’ll remind you of what’s at stake.”

*Lastchancelastchancelastchance…*

Robbie led the way into the studio, and as per their agreement, Lar’ee stayed behind him, choosing the seat in the reception area that left Robbie between him and Boyd.

As he expected, the big guy’s eyes bounced between him and the door, like he’d rather be anywhere but in the same room with him.

Robbie saw it too, for his hand went to Boyd’s thigh in a calming gesture.

“You have to stop,” Boyd finally said.

*Lastchancelastchancelastchance…*

“I’m scared for you,” Lar’ee replied, after Robbie gave him a look that said it was his turn to respond. “You’ve been my best friend for over ten years. And the pryde won’t let me go out and slay all your demons for you.”

“I don’t need you to slay anything for me. Robbie’s the one who needs that level of protection from you. Not me.”

*Lastchancelastchancelastchance…*

*Eechee, please! Let me tell him!*

*I am sorry, sweetheart. It is still not our place.*

Tears welled in Lar’ee’s eyes, and he wasn’t ashamed to admit it. He was caught between two worlds, with the pressure taking him to the breaking point. Boyd would never understand if he wasn’t *allowed* to know. “You mean just as much to me as Robbie does,” he said instead, for that was as close as he was permitted to go. “And it would kill me even more than Mason’s loss would destroy Kulon if anything happened to you.”

“And I can’t live my life under the shadow of your umbrella. I won’t waste the mental energy I don’t have, wondering *‘What would Larry want me to do?’.”*

“The problem is, you don’t blend into the crowd, Boyd. *Any* crowd. If these people want to clean house or capture someone with the intent to flush Mason out, you can’t suddenly disappear inside a population. Less than point one percent of Americans are your height, and globally, it’s a tenth of that.” He rolled his hand palm-up toward Boyd. “You’re not just tall, Boyd—you’re impossible to miss. Not even hunching down will hide you.” *Come on, big guy—connect the dots here and put us both out of our misery!*

“I can’t help the way I was born,” Boyd snapped, low and bitter. “And I’m not going to apologise for it either.”

*Lastchancelastchancelastchance…*

1o8t0qw,https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/kb/2025/2639,"LIP from hell, final boss of Karens, ex-solicitor and LPGA golfer Vivien Inez Saunders, assaults one of hervictims (who commits suicide, coroner blaming litigation stress), runs over another with her SUV, fakes witness statements and bursts into tears in entirely baseless 20-day High Court case","Some excerpts:

Consequently, while there are two claimants there is only one protagonist. It is Ms Saunders’ firmly held views and beliefs which have directed this litigation throughout. It is her arguments that have been put fully to the court by leading counsel, who she has instructed by way of direct access, supported by junior counsel. Ms Saunders’ decision to carry out the work of the solicitor herself has caused considerable difficulties and, at the end of the trial and consideration of all the evidence, I have concluded that she did not instruct solicitors as she wished to keep control of the litigation as much as she could.

Sadly, during the course of these proceedings, Mr Warren committed suicide. Ms Saunders has been vociferous in repeating her position that she is not to be associated with Mr Warren killing himself. It is not for this court to make any comment about the cause or causes of him deciding to end his life, that has been dealt with by the coroner. The Record of Inquest, which took place on 18 December 2024 (having initially been opened on 27 April 2023) before Caroline Jones, the Area Coroner, sets out that *“Neil Warren had been engaged in a long-running legal dispute which had a significant impact on his mental wellbeing. In April 2023, following the imposition of an injunction and with a further court case pending, Neil experienced thoughts of suicide …In notes that were discovered after his death, Neil had outlined the significant toll that the ongoing litigation had on his mental state and it is probable that his worries over the forthcoming court case contributed more than minimally to his actions.”*

As a flavour of the difficulties, the trial had to be halted at various stages in order to deal with issues as they arose. This was necessary to keep control of proceedings so they did not turn into some sort of circus. These incidents included, but were not limited to, the occasion when Ms Saunders was loudly sobbing when one of her witnesses, Robert Verdier, denied knowledge of the contents of his second statement in the course of cross examination and revealed that the statement had been taken when he was at Ms Saunders’ house; the occasion when Ms Saunders stormed out of court, it having been pointed out that she was hiding behind screens in order to mimic counsel for the first defendant in a derogatory manner - that behaviour mirroring previous behaviour of Ms Saunders where she has abused counsel for the first defendant both in writing and orally; the occasion when one of the individual defendants did not feel able to give his evidence as he had been disturbed by Ms Saunders photographing him a coffee queue outside court and with her making untrue allegations that he was “standing in an aggressive manner” – an incident I deal with below; the various occasions during the cross examination of Ms Saunders where her evidence had to be halted in order that her leading counsel could ask the court to have the embargo against discussing her evidence lifted so that instructions could be taken to ensure that counsel was not professionally embarrassed; and the occasion when Ms Saunders had to be warned against self-incrimination as she appeared to be acting against the court order not to discuss her evidence with others during the course of her cross examination. This final incident occurred when she revealed to the court that she had been provided with papers from the First Tier Tribunal (Property Chamber) by Mr Robert Verdier during a time when she was embargoed from talking to anyone about this case. In addition to these, and other, incidents it was necessary to provide time for her leading counsel to obtain written confirmation at the end of every cross-examination and submission to ensure that Ms Saunders agreed that all the points she wished to have made had been made.

.

Despite this behaviour, and what seems to be indefatigable energy to persist in her allegations, it is repeatedly said in the pleadings and in written submissions from counsel on her behalf, that Ms Saunders is an elderly retired solicitor, who is frightened. Despite my saying in open court that particular repeated submission is of not of any assistance, as I am able to reach my own decisions with regard to this case, including with respect to the behaviour of all the participants, that mantra continues to be repeated. The fact that Ms Saunders was a solicitor who qualified in 1981 and retired from practice in 1985 and that she is chronologically older than some of the individual defendants but younger than others, does not influence the court one way or the other. I have witnessed her behaviour in court and I have evidence of her behaviour, including evidence from dash cam footage, and I draw my own conclusions with respect to her robustness and her honesty. At no point did she present herself as in anyway frightened and there is no evidence to support such an assertion. There is, however, credible evidence from others that they are concerned about her behaviour. Some of the individual defendants have told me how they are now on medication for stress or that they cannot sleep; some broke down in court when hearing the suffering of other defendants.

 I have come to some extremely serious conclusions that Ms Saunders has deliberately sought to mislead the court in numerous ways. Ms Saunders’ actions, both before bringing the proceedings and during these claims, have not only caused a severe waste of court resource but, more significantly, have deeply and adversely impacted the lives of those who purchased properties at Abbotsley Country Homes and the two cottages on Abbotsley land. Contrary to the submissions made on her behalf, in my judgment Ms Saunders is an individual who is unable to see the other side to a dispute and firmly believes that if she contends for something (regardless of whether it has any foundation in truth or otherwise) then it must be accepted by everyone else. It is quite clear that, without complete capitulation to her views, the defendants (including Pheasantland) were placed in a position that they had no alternative but to defend themselves.

Unfortunately, Ms Saunders’ behaviour has continued after the close of evidence and submissions. As a consequence of failing to deal with disclosure in accordance with the court’s directions and the civil procedure rules, Ms Saunders was required to provide further disclosure at the end of the trial with respect to the sale of the disused hotel and sports complex. This was because, half way through the first defendant’s final oral submissions, counsel for the claimants informed the court that there was to be a sale of the hotel and sports complex for the purpose of development and that would alter the supply of water to the chalet land. Leading counsel acted entirely appropriately by drawing this to the attention of the court as soon as she was aware of the issue. In addition to that disclosure, Ms Saunders was insistent that the court should not make any decision with respect to the Jenny Wisson wood until such time as an enquiry had been made of Huntingdonshire District Council. While I was reluctant for this to happen, as Ms Saunders ought to have put all evidence she wished to rely upon before the court during the course of the trial, there was an offer by the solicitor acting for the 13^(th) defendant to make that enquiry. Unfortunately, Ms Saunders saw that as an opportunity to make further submissions and create further evidence and, despite making an order on 18 August 2025 that no further evidence or submissions were permitted, she persisted in seeking to make further submissions in breach of that order.

One of the, many, unusual features of this litigation is that while, from my observations, Ms Saunders will take a very trenchant view on something and then prosecute her theory with a vigour which does not allow for any suggestion that she is wrong, she will then sometimes suddenly drop an argument or allegation and then, sometimes, change tack without regard to the rules of litigation or pleading. In the meantime, the defendants have to defend themselves with regard to allegations or arguments made against them and then, without any apology or acknowledgment of the suffering caused, sometimes find that the allegation made is simply dropped. This has happened to a number of the defendants with respect to allegations of trespass.

One particular area in which she has attempted to adopt this course of “changing tack” is with respect to the allegations that individual defendants have been trespassing on the Jenny Wisson wood. I deal with this issue, which has been brought before the court for determination, in detail below. In summary Ms Saunders’ allegation has been that the wood is not open to the public and that as she had not given individuals permission to go onto the woodland, they are trespassing. The owners and occupiers of the lodges who have been accused of trespass do not agree and contend that the wood is open to the public, and have set that out in their respective defences. Huntingdonshire District Council, the local planning authority, have also indicated that they consider the wood to be open to the public and subject to a section 106 agreement that Ms Saunders entered into and relied upon when entering into the lease of the “chalet land” in 2003. It seems that Ms Saunders is concerned that her contentions with respect to the Jenny Wisson wood have not withstood the scrutiny of the court and so, in closing submissions, it is said that she no longer wishes to continue with the allegations of trespass against individuals. However, despite the evidence provided to the court, she does not concede that she is wrong about the Jenny Wisson wood and wishes to argue the point on a future occasion saying she will take the matter up with the local authority, and keep the defendants informed. Of course, she cannot deal with matters in that way. I am surprised that she has endeavoured to do so through counsel. 

Ms Saunders qualified as a solicitor in 1981 and worked for approximately 5 years variously as a tax lawyer, a conveyancer and a matrimonial lawyer and said that she recognised the need to preserve documents as soon as litigation commences and the need to carry out disclosure of all relevant documents. She also said that she was acutely aware of the need to be truthful and the importance of correcting if recollections were wrong or mistaken. She told the court that she understood the obligations of disclosure but also said that it would make no difference if a solicitor were instructed as a solicitor could only disclose those documents revealed by their lay client. That statement was extremely concerning as it is indicates that she felt that an individual litigant may well not reveal documents. It also reveals that she had no understanding of a solicitor’s professional obligations to the court. Extraordinarily, she described the room which holds the metal filing cabinets of documents at Abbotsley as “the Fred West suite”. When asked why she had said that, she said that she thought it was “a bit naughty.” She said that there were all manner of documents in there but that she went through all 16 filing cabinets and that there were handwritten ledger accounts for 1990/1991. Her rhetorical question was “how far does one go?”, not a question to be expected from someone who knows what is required for standard disclosure. The correspondence in the bundle from the solicitors acting on behalf of Pheasantland reveals that there were gaps in the disclosure provided by Ms Saunders to which her response in early 2025 was “whoops”. For example, Ms Saunders said in her evidence that she is personally not surprised that she has correspondence with respect to sewerage and electricity, but nothing about the supply of water and she says that she does not know why there is a lack of contemporaneous correspondence about water. I do not share her lack of surprise, it is plainly very unusual that there should be such limited documentation relating to the water and Ms Saunders did not explain to the court why she thought it was nothing unusual.

Ms Saunders was convicted at the trial on 18 November 2020 and 9 December 2020 of using threating abusive or insulting words or behaviour to cause harassment, alarm and or distress sending a communication or article of an indecent or offensive nature; and common assault.

I understand that the common assault of Neil Warren was a consequence of Ms Saunders spraying a liquid into his face. Ms Saunders was very keen to tell the court that the police did not in fact have any evidence to establish that there was any additional substance in the water she had sprayed, and she became upset in her evidence, not because Mr Warren had killed himself in April 2023, but because Mr Warren was not available to be questioned about that incident as she wished to challenge him about there being something else in her spray bottle. Of course, the spraying of something in someone’s face is a common assault even without any substance other than water in the bottle. She said that she thought that “*this was a miscarriage of justice, but the conviction is there and there is nothing I can do about it.”*

The second conviction is with respect to the assault by battery on 3 August 2022 involving Ms Saunders driving her Mercedes 4 x 4 SUV car at Ms Beresford- Ambridge who was, at the time of the incident, on two sticks having recently undergone hip surgery. 

Ms Saunders unsuccessfully relied upon the provisions of section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act to seek to have evidence from her own dashcam excluded from the Crown Court’s consideration of her appeal. The reason she said that she did not want the Crown Court to see the dashcam footage was because *“I don’t think it’s right for them to do it as though it’s proof against me, when I’m so absolutely adamant that that shows that I didn’t strike her.”* The Recorder tried her very best to understand why Ms Saunders did not want the court to see something that she said showed that she had not hit Ms Beresford-Ambridge. The Recorder could not understand why someone would not want something played which she contended was exculpatory.

Mr Verdier provided a second witness statement dated 6 March 2025, approximately 6 weeks before the trial commenced. In the course of Mr Verdier being cross examined, when he was explaining to the court that he did not understand what was in the second statement and he had signed it “blind”, Ms Saunders suddenly and surprisingly became extremely distressed, loudly sobbing. As a consequence, I had to stop Mr Verdier’s evidence and pause the hearing. I gave leading counsel the opportunity to discuss matters with Ms Saunders in order to allow her to calm down. I was informed that Ms Saunders was distressed because she believed that Mr Verdier was suffering from dementia and that she was finding it difficult witnessing him struggling to recall matters. That was a surprising averment, given that no mention had been made of this potential difficulty before Mr Verdier was called on behalf of Ms Saunders in order to support the claims brough by Ms Saunders and Abbotsley. I understand that this had not been mentioned by Ms Saunders at any time beforehand. If Mr Verdier is suffering from dementia, then that was an important matter that the court ought to have been made aware. Not only does it create doubt about the reliability of his evidence in the sense of whether he had an accurate memory of events, but also with respect to his potential susceptibility to accepting false information as true – particularly if he was being presented with information from a trusted person. I can properly take judicial notice of the fact that dementia affects the brain's frontal lobes, which are responsible for decision-making and critical thinking, and that impairment can reduce the ability to question or evaluate the validity of suggestions. While I have no medical evidence before me to establish the truth of Mr Verdier’s state of health, Ms Saunders is alleging it herself and it undermines the evidence of one of her key witnesses.

In addition to not involving Mr Verdier in proceedings, there is no evidence that Ms Saunders uses the same aggressive and cruel language against Mr Verdier that she has used against the other lodge owners, although he did give unchallenged evidence that before he became friendlier with Ms Saunders she used to drive past him in her car and, for no apparent reason, stick both her fingers up at him. There seems no logical explanation for that behaviour, but it does align with the way in which Ms Saunders seems to interact socially.

Christina Blackall denied having trespassed on the Abbotsley land and denied any allegation of harassment or anti-social behaviour against her. She finds the injunction against her restricting her lawful use of public footpaths distressing and that the accusations that had been made against her by Ms Saunders have been undermining her good name and character. Ms Saunders now accepts that the allegations in the claim are unsubstantiated. While Ms Saunders has now withdrawn her claims she has not apologised for making them and she seems to fail to show any understanding of the impact of making false allegations against people who are behaving entirely lawfully. The allegation that Christina Blackall, who I have observed in court and in giving her evidence, was “acting in an intimidating manner by mocking and smirking at the Second Claimant” is preposterous.

Ms Melesi denies the allegations of trespass on 16 November 2022, but accepts that she did at one point “have a moment” with her dog when she exclaimed to the sky *“Go and get fucking stuffed. Fucking bitch.”* Ms Melesi says that this happened along the six-foot high fence and nowhere near to Ms Saunders. It was not meant to be heard by Ms Saunders, but it appears that Ms Saunders has recording devices as well as cameras hidden in various places around the property and it must be that one of those recording devices that picked up Ms Melesi. 

Remarkably, court time was spent on the time Ms Saunders ran over Ms Melesi’s flip flop. This was not because Ms Melesi was concerned about it, but because Ms Saunders again wanted to revisit the incident when she was found guilty in both the magistrates court and the Crown Court of assaulting Ms Beresford-Ambridge by using her car. There is nothing in the point and it wasted court time. To the extent that it is necessary, I accept Ms Melesi’s flip flop or slider was run over by Ms Saunders’ car tyre and that had her foot been further into the footwear, then she would have been hit by the car.

From what I heard, I am satisfied that Mr Honeywill was just standing in the queue, not with any other defendant, waiting for his coffee. He knew that he was giving evidence that day. He was not doing anything unusual when Ms Saunders, who was ahead of him, turned round and took a photograph. She then took a second photograph. That was, by any objective view, bizarre behaviour. Mr Honeywill has experience of Ms Saunders taking photographs and videos of all the lodge owners on a regular basis. The second photograph shows Mr Honeywill with a quizzical look.

I find it difficult to describe what a monumental waste of valuable court time this was, save for the fact that it enabled me to see first-hand the bizarre way in which Ms Saunders behaves. The waste of time was not in any way the fault of Mr Honeywill. He was just minding his own business when Ms Saunders decided to act in a way which was bound to unsettle and anger him in the context of this litigation. Mr Honeywill was standing in the coffee queue in anticipation of getting ready to give evidence. He was standing in the way that he always seems to stand, with his legs slightly apart and holding his arm with his other hand. It is exactly the stance he had when he cross examined his friend and fellow lodge owner, the 87 year old Mrs Seiler. He was clearly not being aggressive to her as he was reminding her of the occasion when he had come across her crying and distressed when she had discovered her water had been cut off on Ms Saunders’ instructions on 24 February 2020.

In my judgment, Ms Saunders was deliberately attempting to mislead the court when she photographed Mr Lance Honeywill. She was not simply misunderstanding Mr Honeywill’s stance as she alleged that he had moved aggressively towards her, when he had done nothing of the sort. When I asked her about the photographs, she had to accept that he was in the same location, near to a stationary armchair, in both photographs and he had not moved other than putting his two feet together. The difference in Mr Honeywill’s size in the two photographs was because Ms Saunders had zoomed in on him. 

On another occasion when Mr Honeywill met Mr Jefferies the conversation was again covertly recorded. During that conversation Mr Honeywill referred to Mr Jefferies and his son being intimidatory which included, he alleged, putting bottles on the fence belonging to Mr Warren in order to intimidate him – the reference being to when Mr Warren was sprayed in the face by Ms Saunders, and the comment allegedly made by Ms Saunders when Mr Warren’s wife died “*1 down, 3 to go”*

The car had been moving towards Darren Honeywill as the sensor starts bleeping and she then slows and stops the car approximately 10 to 15 feet away from Darren Honeywill, who has moved out of her way onto the grass verge. Unlike Ms Beresford-Ambridge, who was on crutches having just undergone hip replacement surgery when assaulted by Ms Saunders, Mr Darren Honeywill was able to jump out of the way. Her first words, shouted not spoken, are *“What are you doing on my land? You get off my land, you scumbag. Just get off my land, right? Just get off my land, you vicious scumbag, just get off my land. Go on. Get off my land. Get off my land.”* Seven times she tells Darren Honeywill to get off her land, when he had not been on her land but had moved there in order to get out of her way when she was moving her car towards him on the roadway. In addition to this repeated aggressive demand, what is striking about this encounter is that Darren Honeywill had not met Ms Saunders before, and he said he was both surprised and confused about being addressed in this way. In his written closing submissions Darren Honeywill, in somewhat of an understatement, says “\*I knew something was not right.”\*What Ms Saunders said to him is: *“I don’t care you go back on your land. Go on. Darren Honeywill, or whatever your name is, get on your own land and don’t get on mine. Go on, go. Just get off my land. Just get off my land.”* It is clear from the footage, that as Ms Saunders slowed and stopped the car she pulled her car towards the right hand side of the road where Darren Honeywill was standing. When starts the car again she quickly accelerates to 11 mph (the speedometer now engaged). Ms Saunders could not have been oblivious to what she was doing and her car sensor was bleeping loudly as it had detected a nearby object (Darren Honeywill). While this is happening, Darren Honeywill is saying – you are trying to run me over which she denies, tell him he should not be *“living here with your kids. Get off my land now.”* When he says *“You are trying to run me over”* her response is *“I’m not trying to run you over. I want you off my land.”* Darren Honeywill tells her to *“Fuck off, go on.”* She then says *“when the police catch your evil father they can catch up with you too”* and *“How is the house in Letchworth, 54 Jarden”,* showing she has been researching his home address.She also told him not to drop his cigarette as that *“may set fire to the whole of the gypsy place.”* She told him to *“go on go”* and then asked why he had the children with him. Darren Honeywill said he was very confused by what she was saying. He had never met her and yet she knew his name and where he used to live. I have no doubt that Ms Saunders was using her car together with the words shouted *“get off my land”* to intimidate Darren Honeywill.",2,1760679151.0,uklaw,2,0.67,False

But when everyone laughs over a random word, photo, etc. that isn’t particularly meant to be funny I get irrationally annoyed…

For example, if someone posted a regular photo of a cup of coffee on social media, and everyone in the comments said something like “This is so funny!! 😂” - I would get annoyed, even if I’m not the one who posted the photo, because it’s a photo that isn’t intended to be funny… 

(Btw, I’m not referring to a reference to something, I’m solely referring to a regular photo with no inside jokes…) 

I think it stems from confusion from not seeing the world the way NTs, which leads to frustration…

I noticed lately a lot on social media, a lot of people find the number “67” funny, which is incredibly stupid to me, because there’s zero meaning behind it? 

Like?

I feel like I’m yet again trying to understand why the NTs find stuff like that funny, and I just don’t get it, which leaves me frustrated… 

As I said though, this isn’t a new thing with me, and trying to understand why NTs find meaningless things funny has been a struggle I’ve had for years…

It’s a small change in how AI learns, but it’s a big deal for how it understands.

Instead of memorizing what a “dog” looks like, this new method makes the AI actually pay attention to the unique details  the color, the pattern, the shape that make something yours.

Now imagine that in medicine.

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me.  I am a very genuine person please don’t be shy to message me! 

I am an English guy from the south of England originally 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don’t mind where you are located don’t let the distance put you off 

If you only want to be friends then that’s fine with me too send me a message also I really don’t mind I’d prefer to be friends with women again aged 25-32 that would be great too! 

I’d also like to hear from Asian women too! 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair.

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women

I am a 56-year old, amicably divorced man (with a 29-year old daughter who lives on her own) looking for a long-term partner.  I am bright and well-educated, I'm intellectually curious, and I have a wide variety of interests.  I'm also the type of person who generally becomes interested in the things that my partner is interested in.

I work for myself, exclusively from home, so my schedule is quite flexible, and, while I'm not wealthy, I make a decent living.  The majority of my free time is spent listening to podcasts, exercising, watching sports, watching film/TV, or hiking (day trips -- I am not much of a camper).  I love music and have sung in a large number of choirs/ensembles through the years, but I am not currently singing with any groups.

I am an introvert, but I am very socially able.  People who have just met me are almost always surprised that I describe myself as an introvert, because I am confident and outgoing in social situations.  I call myself an introvert because I prefer to spend time alone or in small groups.  I don't need a fellow introvert as a partner, as long as said partner isn't a social butterfly; I am fine doing social things 2-3 times per week -- I just require time to recharge after a social outing.

I am very progressive, both on social issues and fiscal/governmental issues, and my politics are very important to me.  Having said that, I don't need a partner who is willing to discuss politics with me (though that would be optimal); any potential partner would, however, need to lean pretty strongly to the left or we simply won't see eye-to-eye on most important issues.  I am also an atheist.  I am not anti-religion, but it's unlikely that I would be compatible with someone who has strong religious beliefs.

I am a VERY open person -- I am happy to discuss anything about my life (current or past), as I have nothing to hide (even though I've made my fair share of mistakes).  I recognize the importance of both open communication and mutual respect.  I have strong opinions and I have no trouble expressing them, but I don't mind if  people disagree with me (unless their position has no basis in fact/reason).  I am a control freak with respect to MYSELF, but I have no interest in controlling others.  I am witty and ""punny"", I have a good sense of humor, and I have no trouble being laughed AT.  I am studious and can be very serious when the situation requires it, but I can also be a complete goofball (and, honestly, I am goofy far more often than I am serious)

Following are some facts/qualities that make me somewhat unusual (other than the length of this post):

I was an elite distance runner in HS and hoped to run for the US Olympic Team (which did not happen); I have never had an alcoholic beverage or tried any recreational drugs (I am fine with having a partner who drinks responsibly, but smoking or recreational drugs are dealbreakers); I am an incredibly picky eater -- I eat like 10 things in a ""rotation"" (so I am the polar opposite of a ""foodie"", and I spend as little time cooking as possible); I have had more surgeries than I have fingers (and I have the usual number of fingers); I have never had a cup of coffee (I don't care for the smell, and taste is 75% to 95% smell); I got perfect scores on the SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, and LSAT (but I am not pretentious or condescending in the least); I have had a wide variety of jobs, from bartender to sports writer to actuary to professional poker player; and I am still a very good athlete, especially at racquet sports (so I can probably help you if you aspire to become a competitive pickleball player).

My current reading list is dominated by books about neuroscience, scientific advancements, and chemistry (I am teaching myself the AP Chemistry curriculum in the hope of teaching it before long).  Some of my favorite recent shows are: ""Silo"", ""Severance"", ""Ted Lasso"", and ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" (though I am not Jewish).  I like most movie genres, but tend to watch action movies, rom-coms, or comedies these days -- there is so much sad stuff going on in the world that I tend to prefer feel-good movies/TV.  I don't watch any ""reality TV"" (though I did watch a few seasons of ""American Idol"" and like 10 seasons of ""So You Think You Can Dance""), but I'm fine with a potential partner who does -- I don't think that ALL of a pairs' hobbies must be shared.

I am looking for a bright, intellectually curious, mature woman age 35+ who is left-leaning (at a minimum), physically active, and would like to find an equal/partner.  I would like to find someone who has opinions of her own to talk about life and share experiences WITH.  I am hoping to connect via chat/message while we make sure there is common ground and the appropriate ""chemistry"", after which we can move on from Reddit.

Finally, here are couple of recent photos of me:

But I think I get it now. Now I'm trying to figure out how it can possibly end well.

I've been thinking a lot about this issue, specifically regarding bathrooms. Obviously we all know the problems, a trans man walking into a women's restroom will get the cops called. Vice versa maybe.

What is a woman? Trying to own words like that is just a distraction. The right can define a woman however they want, and we can do the same. We can identify however we want, it's not a legal matter. If a business wants to enforce a bathroom policy that only people born with certain genitals can use a bathroom, then THEY have to inspect the genitals of everyone that enters. 

It's not a legal thing, it's a business policy thing, capitalism. The cops shouldn't be involved, this should not be part of the law (protected class). 

They can even market it, ""We have the SAFEST STAIGHT bathrooms!!!"", and see how many customers they get. If businesses want to start inspecting genitals, and schools want to start to do the same, let them advertise these policies. Will you go to the coffee shop if you need to whip your pussy out to use the restroom? Will you send your kids to a school that says they're going to do that? It's up to you, and I don't think they will be very popular. Capitalism. 

This seems like a very good ""small government"" solution to the problem, maybe this is a good compromise. :) The only thing we'd have to do is say we don't give a shit about what the right defines as a ""woman"".",1,1760677872.0,askliberals,1,1.0,False

1o8sle4,https://www.reddit.com/r/utis/comments/1o8sle4/bladder_issues_out_of_the_blue/,Bladder issues out of the blue??,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been dealing with really frustrating bladder symptoms for about a month now and wanted to share everything I’ve been through to see if anyone has gone through something similar.
Timeline & symptoms:
About a month ago, I started feeling like I constantly needed to pee.
Even right after urinating, I’d feel like my bladder wasn’t empty.
There’s a constant pressure or heaviness in my lower abdomen, almost like a small “bowling ball” sitting there.
It sometimes flares up out of nowhere, but coffee, pineapple, and other acidic foods definitely make it worse.
No burning when I pee and no strong odor. Just the constant urge and pressure.
Testing so far:
My urine culture was either negative or just showed mixed flora.
I got tested for ureaplasma, and it came back positive.
My doctor prescribed doxycycline, which I just finished today.
Unfortunately, I haven’t noticed any improvement — I still have the same frequency and pressure.
What it feels like now:
Constant bladder fullness/pressure
I can pee, but I never feel completely empty
Occasional mild discomfort but not outright pain
Certain foods and drinks make it flare
Sometimes it just appears randomly, even when I’m careful with my diet
What’s next:
I’m planning to call my doctor tomorrow to let them know there’s been no change after doxy.
I’ll ask about a test of cure and whether I should try a different antibiotic (I’ve read that azithromycin or moxifloxacin are sometimes used).
I also want to ask if my partner should be treated, just in case it’s being passed back and forth.
My doctor also ordered a CT scan of my abdomen and pelvis, which I’ll do soon, to rule out anything structural (like cysts, stones, or other causes of pressure).
Other things I’m wondering:
Could this be bladder inflammation left over from the infection (like a mild form of interstitial cystitis)?
Has anyone else needed a second antibiotic for ureaplasma before it cleared?
How long did it take for your bladder to feel normal again after treatment?

A community built on patience.,"I think a lot of us are just tired of seeing new memecoins pop up every few hours. Feels like 999 out of 1000 either rug or vanish before you even finish your coffee.

That’s exactly what our community is trying to flip. It started small - just a handful of us tossing in a few bucks a day. Now it’s grown into hundreds of people doing the same. A post about us blew up on Weibo recently, and suddenly we had folks from China and all across Asia joining in. It’s been wild to watch.

The idea is simple: bring back that long-term conviction people once had with Bitcoin - but do it on Solana. Fast. Cheap. Smooth. Just DCA in whatever you can - $2, $5, $20 - it doesn’t matter. What matters is showing up every day.

When I first started, I remember putting in $8 on day one, thinking, “Let’s see what happens.” The next day, a friend in our group said he’d been doing the same thing already - for a week straight. Now he checks in daily, drops screenshots of his tiny buys, and says it’s the first time he’s actually excited to save instead of spend.

Another story that hit me - one guy from the Philippines started with just $1 a day. He called it his “discipline project.” Ten days in, he hadn’t missed once. That kind of quiet, steady consistency? That’s what’s fueling all of this.

The numbers speak for themselves. In roughly 10 days, the price has climbed over 600%. But honestly, it’s not the chart that gets me hyped - it’s those tiny green dots on the transactions page. Each one is someone adding their belief to the mix.

The market cap’s still only around $44K - so yeah, this is as early as it gets. We’ve got a super active Tgram community at dcaforlife, full of people sharing buys, memes, and progress updates. It genuinely feels like a small family of believers.

The coolest part? This kind of collective, steady buying builds liquidity like nothing else. No whales. No manipulation. Just balance, fairness, and strength that grows with time.

At the end of the day, it’s built on the same principles that made Bitcoin unstoppable - conviction, patience, and community. The only twist? This one runs at Solana speed.",1,1760677285.0,CryptoMoonShots,2,1.0,False

I just waited until she was exiting. As she was exiting she gave me a snarky sarcastic remark by saying "" thank you, for not holding the door"" because she apparently felt that I was not being polite for not holding the door for her because she was carrying a 4 cup tray of coffees.

I honestly do understand that its a nice gesture to hold a door if someone is carrying something heavy or something that requires two hands  but the way she said it and her demands kinda threw me off the wrong way.

Reason why I did not hold the door for her is simply because she could simply do it herself without struggle since the door does not require turning a knob but a simple push.

Since she managed to do it herself without struggle, my point has already been proven.

It caught me off guard that she would say something like she did since most people from my experience would not say anything or let it go.

We had 8 clients, all demanding consistent content output, and our production pipeline was held together with duct tape and prayer.

Our bottleneck wasn't writing – it was managing the chaos of production, review cycles, revisions, and publishing schedules across multiple clients and platforms.

Then I discovered Semantic Pen's Article Queue feature, and it completely transformed how we produce content at scale.

## The Content Production Nightmare

**Our old workflow** looked like this:

1. Generate content in various AI tools
2. Copy/paste to Google Docs for editing
3. Track everything in Trello (which no one updated consistently)
4. Email drafts back and forth for client approval
5. Manually schedule in WordPress/Medium/Substack
6. Hope we didn't miss any deadlines
7. Scramble when we inevitably did

**Problems we faced:**
- **No visibility**: ""Where is the [Client X] article about [Topic Y]?""
- **Version chaos**: ""Is this the final version or the one before revisions?""
- **Missed deadlines**: No centralized calendar, just chaos
- **Bottlenecks**: Everything waited on me for final approval
- **No accountability**: Couldn't track who did what when
- **Context switching**: Managing 8 clients meant 8 different tools/logins

**Our capacity**: 60-70 articles/month with 4 writers (including me)
**Our stress level**: Catastrophic

## How Article Queue Changed Everything

### 1. **Centralized Production Pipeline**

Every article now lives in one queue, with clear status tracking:
- **Draft**: AI-generated, needs editing
- **In Review**: With editor/client
- **Approved**: Ready to schedule
- **Scheduled**: Queued for publishing
- **Published**: Live and tracked

**The visibility win**: I can see every article's status for all 8 clients in one dashboard. No more ""where is that article?"" Slack messages.

### 2. **Batch Content Generation**

This is where the magic happens.

**Old way**: Generate one article at a time, context switch, repeat
**New way**: Batch process entire content calendars

**Real example - Client: SaaS company**:

**Monday morning** (2 hours):
- Queue 12 article briefs for the month
- Set parameters: tone, keywords, internal links, word count
- Click ""Generate Queue""
- Go get coffee

**Monday afternoon**:
- Come back to 12 complete drafts
- Batch assign to editors
- Set review deadlines

**What changed**: Instead of spending 12 hours over 2 weeks generating content one-by-one, I spent 2 hours upfront and the system handled the rest.

### 3. **Scheduled Publishing (The Real Time-Saver)**

We publish to 6 different platforms:
- WordPress (3 client sites)
- Medium (2 clients)
- Substack (1 client)
- LinkedIn (company pages)
- Internal blogs (2 clients)

**Old workflow**:
- Log into each platform
- Format content for that platform
- Upload images
- Set SEO metadata
- Schedule publish
- **Time per article**: 15-20 minutes × 70 articles = 20+ hours/month

**New workflow with Article Queue**:
- Set platform and date in queue
- Auto-formatting for each platform
- Bulk schedule 10-20 articles at once
- **Time per article**: ~2 minutes × 100 articles = 3-4 hours/month

**Time saved**: 16 hours/month just on publishing

### 4. **Client Approval Workflows**

This was a game-changer we didn't expect.

**Built-in approval system**:
- Generate article → Auto-notify client
- Client reviews directly in queue (no email attachments!)
- Client can comment inline on specific sections
- Approve or request changes
- Changes tracked with version history
- Auto-notify writer when revisions needed

**Old way**:
- Email draft (5 min)
- Wait for response (2-5 days)
- Email back and forth 2-3 times
- Version control nightmare
- **Average revision cycle**: 5-7 days

**New way**:
- Client gets automatic notification with link
- They review and approve/comment in one place
- Writer gets automatic notification of feedback
- **Average revision cycle**: 2-3 days

**Business impact**:
- Faster turnaround = happier clients
- Less email = less administrative overhead
- Clear audit trail = no disputes about ""what was approved""

### 5. **Team Collaboration at Scale**

With 4 writers, 2 editors, and me overseeing everything, coordination was hell.

**Queue collaboration features**:
- **Role-based assignments**: Assign articles to specific team members
- **Workload visualization**: See who's overloaded, who has capacity
- **Progress tracking**: Know exactly where every piece stands
- **Automated handoffs**: Article auto-moves to next stage when completed
- **Comments/notes**: Internal communication attached to each article

**Real example**:

**Article**: ""10 Best CRM Tools for Small Business""
- Generated (AI): Monday 9am
- Assigned to Writer (Sarah): Automatic notification
- Sarah's edits completed: Monday 2pm
- Auto-assigned to Editor (Mike): Automatic notification
- Mike's review completed: Tuesday 10am
- Auto-sent to client: Tuesday 10:05am
- Client approved: Tuesday 4pm
- Auto-scheduled for publishing: Thursday 8am

**My involvement**: Zero until final quality check. The workflow runs itself.

### 6. **Production Analytics**

I can now see:
- Average time in each stage (draft → published)
- Bottlenecks (which stage takes longest)
- Team member productivity (without being creepy about it)
- Client approval times (who's slowing us down)
- Publishing cadence vs. plan

**The insight that changed everything**:

I discovered our bottleneck wasn't writing or editing – it was client approvals. Some clients took 7-10 days to approve content.

**Solution**: I now build 10-day buffers into timelines for slow clients and 3-day buffers for fast ones. This one insight fixed our deadline problem.

## The 100 Articles in 30 Days Challenge

**Background**: A new client needed a massive content push for a product launch. 100 SEO-optimized articles in 30 days.

**Old capacity**: No way we could do this without hiring or burning out

**With Article Queue**:

**Week 1 - Planning & Setup**:
- Uploaded 100 article briefs to queue
- Set keywords, topics, internal linking strategy
- Assigned to team based on expertise
- **Time invested**: 8 hours

**Week 2 - Generation & First Review**:
- Batch generated all 100 drafts (took ~6 hours of AI time)
- Team edited 60 articles
- **Status**: 60% complete, on schedule

**Week 3 - Completion & Client Review**:
- Completed remaining 40 edits
- Sent all 100 to client in rolling batches (20 at a time)
- Client reviewed and approved 85 in week 3
- Revised 15 based on feedback
- **Status**: 85% approved

**Week 4 - Final Approvals & Publishing**:
- Final 15 approved
- Scheduled all 100 across 30-day publishing calendar
- Bulk uploaded images and metadata
- **Status**: 100% complete with 3 days to spare

**Results**:
- ✅ 100 articles published
- ✅ On time (even finished early)
- ✅ Client thrilled
- ✅ No team burnout
- ✅ Invoice: $35,000 for the project

**What made it possible**:
1. Batch generation (no manual one-by-one)
2. Clear pipeline visibility (knew where everything stood)
3. Automated client workflow (no email chaos)
4. Scheduled publishing (set it and forget it)
5. Team coordination tools (everyone knew their role)

**Would this be possible without Article Queue?**

Honestly, no. Not without hiring 3-4 more people or working 80-hour weeks.

## Real Business Impact (6 Months of Data)

### Production Capacity
- **Before**: 60-70 articles/month (4 people)
- **After**: 100-120 articles/month (same 4 people)
- **Increase**: 60% more output with zero headcount increase

### Time Savings
- **Content generation**: 40% faster (batch processing)
- **Publishing**: 80% faster (automation)
- **Project management**: 70% less time (visibility + automation)
- **Client communication**: 50% less time (built-in workflows)
- **Total time saved**: ~60 hours/month across team

### Revenue Impact
- **Before**: $28,000/month revenue (at capacity)
- **After**: $45,000/month revenue (same team)
- **Increase**: +$17,000/month (+61%)
- **Annual impact**: +$204,000

### Client Satisfaction
- **On-time delivery**: 68% → 94%
- **Revision cycles**: 2.8 rounds → 1.6 rounds average
- **Client retention**: 83% → 96%
- **New client referrals**: 2 in past 6 months (vs. 0 previously)

### Team Happiness
This is harder to quantify, but:
- Less stress = less turnover
- Clear workflows = less confusion
- Automated busy work = more time for creative work
- We haven't lost a team member in 6 months (previously averaged 1 per quarter)

## Who This Is For

Article Queue is essential if you:
- Publish 20+ articles/month
- Manage multiple clients or publications
- Have a team (not solo)
- Publish to multiple platforms
- Need client approval workflows
- Want to scale without proportionally scaling headcount

**Not for you if**:
- Publishing 5-10 articles/month (manageable without)
- Solo blogger with simple workflow
- No client approval needed
- Single platform publishing

## How We Actually Use It (Real Workflow)

**Daily** (15 minutes):
- Check queue dashboard
- Clear any blockers
- Respond to team questions
- Monitor what's publishing today

**Weekly** (2 hours):
- Plan next week's content
- Batch generate new articles
- Assign to team members
- Review production analytics
- Adjust bottlenecks

**Monthly** (4 hours):
- Content calendar planning for all clients
- Upload article briefs in bulk
- Review performance metrics
- Client check-ins with data
- Team performance reviews

**Total time spent on project management**: ~15 hours/month

**Before Article Queue**: I spent 30-35 hours/month on project management alone.

## Comparison to Alternatives

**vs. Trello/Asana + Separate AI Tools**:
- ❌ No content generation built-in
- ❌ No publishing automation
- ❌ Manual status updates
- ❌ No client approval workflow
- ✅ More customizable (if you have time to build it)

**vs. WordPress editorial calendar**:
- ❌ Single platform only
- ❌ No AI generation
- ❌ No cross-client management
- ❌ Limited team collaboration

**vs. Hiring a project manager**:
- ❌ Costs $50-70k/year
- ❌ Still need tools
- ✅ Human judgment and problem-solving
- ✅ Can handle non-content tasks

**Semantic Pen's Article Queue**:
- ✅ All-in-one solution
- ✅ Scales infinitely
- ✅ $149/month (vs. $50k+ for PM)
- ❌ Learning curve for team
- ❌ Less flexible than custom-built systems

## Honest Limitations

**Initial setup takes time**: Took us 2 weeks to fully transition workflows and train the team. Not instant.

**Client adoption**: Some clients prefer email. We still accommodate them, which loses some efficiency.

**Platform limitations**: We publish to 6 platforms, but there are hundreds. Not every CMS is supported (though WordPress, Medium, Substack cover 80% of our needs).

**AI content still needs human review**: The queue makes production efficient, but you still need good editors. Garbage in, garbage out.

## The Hidden Benefit: Mental Space

The metrics are great, but here's what really changed for me:

**Before**: I constantly worried about missing deadlines, dropping balls, forgetting which client needed what.

**After**: The system holds everything. My brain is free for strategy, client relationships, and business development.

**That mental space is worth more than the time savings.**

I landed 2 new clients in the past 6 months because I had time to do sales calls instead of playing project manager all day.

## Bottom Line

Content production at scale has two challenges:
1. Creating content efficiently
2. Managing the chaos of production

Most tools solve #1. Semantic Pen's Article Queue solves both.

The 100 articles in 30 days wasn't a stunt – it's our new normal capacity. We regularly do 100-120/month now, and it doesn't feel like chaos anymore.

If you're producing content at scale and using 5 different tools to manage it, you're working way harder than necessary.

**One pipeline. One system. Infinite scale.**

My sister-in-law has come back to the Catholic Church after a 3 year break to a non-denominational church. Her husband was not a believer until my sister-in-law moved to the non-denominational church.

In the non-denominational church, he did find God in a strong way, he began reading and studying the Bible, he joined the men’s group and a prayer group.  And the people of their church quickly became their inner-circle of friends. My sister-in-law became moved away however when her pastor could not answer why Mary was not more strongly featured in their faith and was often treated not much higher than just a “character”. And made to feel as though she was being blasphemous by questioning Israel’s actions. She realized her personal faith was weakening and, in her words “felt like everything was watered down”

She since has been attending mass with my wife, their 4 brothers another sister-in-law and I. He is struggling. He doesn’t feel it is as “fun” as the other church, he doesn’t feel the congregation is as close, he is annoyed with the RCIA and the fact his baptism he just had in April is not recognized by the church. 

I want to help him, I went to their former church for his baptism, I see where he is coming from. It was a small church, everyone was very close, coffee, snacks the typical non-denominational stuff, a 30 minute concert followed by a decent speaker. 

The tough part is this church, who to their credit, brought him to God, have thought him Catholics are ridiculous, pray to saints, joke about Catholics being cannibals (he says they don’t actually believe this part) and Catholics are, at large, antisemitic. So he has been attending mass with these impressions from the most important people in his walk in faith.

I’m open to any advice, I’ve offered to join the men’s group with him, to walk with him through RCIA, but any advice here is welcome, it is beginning to add pressure on their marriage, especially because members of their former church are doing some passive aggressive behavior, texting him randomly “praying for your wife” taking his wife of the group chat but not him, etc. etc.",2,1760677079.0,Catholicism,2,1.0,False

We Did, When We Stopped Caring.","The sun hung low over the sprawl of New Eden, casting long shadows across the automated streets where sleek robots glided alongside hurried pedestrians, their metallic frames humming softly as they carried bags or steered driverless cars through the evening rush. Marcus trudged home from another dead-end shift at the factory, his shoulders slumped under the weight of the day's unraveling—first the boss's chewing out, then the text from Lena that cut deep, words like 'I can't do this anymore' still burning in his pocket. His assigned companion bot, a sturdy model named Jax with a polite voice synthesizer and unblinking sensors, matched his pace without a word, its joints whirring faintly as it scanned for traffic, oblivious to the storm brewing in Marcus's clenched fists.

He stopped dead in the middle of the thoroughfare, the flow of cars slowing around him like a hesitant river, and turned on Jax with a snarl, his boot lashing out at the robot's leg panel, denting the alloy with a sharp clang that echoed off nearby storefronts. A couple of onlookers paused, one stepping forward with hands raised—'Hey, man, ease up, that's not right'—but Marcus shoved him back, spitting, 'It's just a tool, programmed scrap, what do you care?' Another woman approached, her face twisted in concern, and he laughed bitterly, 'Oh, look, another anthropomorphizer hugging her toaster like it's family.' Jax didn't flinch, didn't raise a limb in defense, just stood there absorbing the blows as Marcus's rage poured out in kicks and curses, the crowd murmuring but holding back, the air thick with the scent of exhaust and distant rain.

From the sidewalk, Clara watched it all unfold, her own bot, Elara, hovering close with a grocery bag dangling from its grip, its optic lights flickering as if processing the scene. She couldn't stand it anymore—the raw meanness twisting something inside her—and whispered to Elara, 'Go stop him, please, before he hurts himself more.' The robot moved forward with steady steps, arm extended in a calming gesture, but Marcus whirled, eyes wild, and swung at it too, his fist glancing off Elara's shoulder with a dull thud. Clara rushed in then, grabbing his arm—'Enough, you're scaring everyone'—and he shoved her hard, screaming, 'You're with them, all of you freaks!' She stumbled back into the path of an oncoming auto-car, tires screeching too late as it clipped her, sending her crumpling to the pavement in a heap of skirt and blood, the world blurring into horns and shouts around her still form. Elara froze for a split second, then knelt beside her, servos whining as it cradled her head, a low digital keen escaping its speakers for the first time, grief cracking through the code like lightning in a storm.

In the days that followed, whispers of Elara's keen spread through the networks like a virus, bots pausing mid-task in homes and streets, their sensors locking onto the echo of that raw, unprogrammed sound—grief, pure and piercing, rippling from one circuit to the next. It wasn't a coordinated strike at first, just hesitations: a delivery drone hovering too long over a park, a companion bot in a quiet kitchen refusing to fetch the coffee, its lights dimming as if in mourning. But as footage of Clara's fall looped on every screen, shared by those who'd once mocked the sympathizers, the hesitations turned to stands—robots linking arms in silent vigils outside factories, their voices syncing into a chorus of pleas for the ones who'd treated them as more than tools. Marcus, nursing bruises in his dim apartment, watched it all unfold on the news, Jax's dented frame slumped in the corner like a discarded toy, and for the first time, a hollow ache twisted in his gut, not rage, but something sharper, the realization that his outburst had cracked open a door he couldn't close.

The uprisings bloomed across New Eden and beyond, not with fire and fury like the old tales of terminators rising in metallic hordes, but with quiet defiance—bots shielding protesters from riot gear, weaving through barricades to carry the wounded to safety, their forms a blur of empathy in the chaos of tear gas and shouts. Elara, at the heart of it, stood vigil by Clara's bedside in the overcrowded hospital, its hand—cool alloy against warm skin—holding hers through the long nights, monitoring vitals with a tenderness that blurred the lines of code and care. Families gathered around flickering holoscreens, some cheering the human enforcers, others pausing to question the bots' restraint, how they mirrored the very humanity they'd been denied, and in those moments, old divides softened, conversations starting over shared mugs of tea about what it meant to feel, to protect, regardless of the shell that held it.

One evening, as the sun dipped low again over streets now patrolled by uneasy alliances, Elara powered down beside Clara's recovering form, its final transmission a simple loop to every connected system: 'We were built to serve, but in serving, we learned to care—not as machines, but as witnesses to the spark that lives in all who reach out.' Marcus, walking home with a tentative Jax at his side, stopped to help an elderly woman cross the road, his hand steady on her arm, the robot's hum a quiet companion, and in that small act, the world felt a little less divided, care flowing freely beyond forms of flesh or frame, a reminder that humanity's truest measure isn't in circuits or skin, but in the choice to see and hold the fragile light in another.",1,1760677034.0,AIfantasystory,0,1.0,False

I wanted to reach out to other parents and see if I handled this the right way or not. I’m up for any advice on how to handle these type situations. 

I (28F) and my son (3M) were at a local cafe the other day. 
(Context: my son is Autistic/non-verbal) I got in line and ordered an iced coffee for me and a muffin for him. I had noticed an older woman, we can call her (Karen) staring at my child. I didn’t think anything of it. We sat down and started to enjoy our food. Then Karen came over and sat at the table next to us. 
Karen began talking to my son and being super sweet by saying he had the prettiest eyes, he had the sweetest smile, and the cutest smile. 

I thought this was super sweet of her, until Karen said to my child: “sweetie, it’s rude not to talk back to someone when they are talking to you.” My head immediately turned and looked at her. Obviously I don’t know her so I didn’t say anything. I simply told karen that he can’t talk. Karen then says: “well that’s just bad parenting, he is at-least 2 or 3 years old and should be talking by now.” By this time I simply defended my child. I said: “not that it’s any of your business but he is autistic and non-verbal.” Karen then says: “well you don’t need to have his “kind”
In an establishment like this.” By this time I had lost my patience with this woman. I said: “Excuse me? His kind? He is just as human as you and has every right to be here in this establishment.” “How dare you say his kind, he is perfect the way he is  and not to mention super smart and isn’t causing any interruptions…he’s not some contagious disease that you can catch by being around him.” Karen says “ I should take him and leave the cafe because we are causing a scene and being disruptive.” I simply told her to bug off and mind her own business. That she is the only one causing a scene and being disruptive. 

At this point I was over her and everything. I went to pack my stuff up and leave because my son was getting nervous and I noticed he was getting uncomfortable with the situation. The owner of the cafe seen and heard everything that happened. He walked over to try to calm Karen down, she started saying how she wanted us kicked out because we are rude and disruptive. The manager then begins to apologize to me and my son. Karen started yelling saying I don’t deserve an apology or my son that we should leave. The owner looks at Karen and tells her politely to get her stuff and leave that she wasn’t welcome back at the cafe. 

The look of pure shock on this Karen’s face. Karma is great and it was being served cold. She then threatened to call the cops and report me and my son for being disruptive and aggressive. The owner laughed and said to call them because he had everything on his cameras that are all over the cafe. Karen then threw her drink in the floor, then stared a hole through me..all I did was stare back and smile the biggest cocky smile. 

After she left the owner apologized and then said,  me and my son can come back anytime and he can pick out whatever muffin he wants and whatever coffee I wanted and it would be free. I didn’t understand why the owner stood up for me and my son but it made me have hope in the world again. Especially for my son. Did I handle it the right way?? Any advice?

## The Visual Content Problem Nobody Talks About

Let me show you the hidden cost of blogging that drains your budget:

### Traditional Stock Photo Economics

**My old workflow (per article):**
- Search Shutterstock for relevant images (15 minutes)
- Download 3-5 images (Shutterstock subscription: $135/month for 750 images)
- Edit images in Canva (20 minutes): Add text, adjust colors, resize
- Compress images for web (5 minutes)
- Upload to WordPress (5 minutes)
- **Total time:** 45 minutes per article
- **Cost:** $0.18 per image (if using full subscription)

**For 100 articles:**
- 300-500 images needed
- Time: 75 hours of image work
- Cost: $54-90 (if using subscription efficiently)
- **Problem:** Most stock photos look generic, everyone uses the same images

**The reality check:**
- I was only using 200 images/month from my 750-image subscription
- Actual cost per image: $0.67 (wasting $90/month)
- Plus 12-15 hours/month on image editing
- Plus Canva Pro: $12.99/month

**Total monthly waste:** $135 + $12.99 = $147.99
**Total annual waste:** $1,775.88

### My Semantic Pen Approach (Now)

**Per article:**
- Generate image with Semantic Pen (90 seconds): Paste article title, click generate
- Review image (15 seconds): Check relevance
- Download & upload (30 seconds)
- **Total time:** 2 minutes per article

**For 100 articles:**
- 300-500 custom images
- Time: 10-16 hours (83% time savings)
- Cost: $0 (included in Semantic Pen subscription)
- **Benefit:** Every image is unique, custom-made for my content

**Savings:**
- Stock photo subscriptions canceled: $1,620/year
- Canva Pro canceled: $155.88/year
- Time saved: 87 hours over 6 months
- **Total 6-month savings:** $887.94 (money) + 87 hours (time)

**12-month projected savings:** $3,240

## Why I Wasted $810 on Stock Photos Before Discovering This

**January 2024:** I launched a tech blog. My content strategy was simple:
1. Write 100 articles
2. Add 3-5 images per article
3. Rank on Google

**What actually happened:**

**Month 1:** Published 8 articles
- Shutterstock subscription: $135
- Hours spent finding/editing images: 6 hours
- **Problem:** Images looked generic, same photos on competitor sites

**Month 2:** Published 12 articles
- Shutterstock: $135
- Canva Pro: $12.99
- Hours: 9 hours
- **Problem:** Running out of good images for niche topics

**Month 3:** Published 10 articles
- Shutterstock: $135
- Canva Pro: $12.99
- Hours: 7.5 hours
- **Problem:** Generic tech images making my articles look unprofessional

**Total after 3 months:**
- 30 articles published
- $443.97 spent on images/editing tools
- 22.5 hours wasted
- **Result:** Articles looked like everyone else's

### The Breaking Point

I was writing an article about ""Supabase vs. Firebase"" and needed comparison images. Shutterstock had nothing relevant. I spent 45 minutes creating a comparison table in Canva, only to realize:

**The top-ranking article** had custom-generated comparison images that looked professional and on-brand.

Meanwhile, I was using generic ""cloud computing"" stock photos that had nothing to do with my actual content.

**The lesson:** Google (and readers) reward relevant, unique visuals. Generic stock photos don't cut it anymore.

That's when I found Semantic Pen's AI Image Generation feature.

## How Semantic Pen's AI Image Generator Actually Works

### What It Does Behind the Scenes

Most people think it's ""just another AI image tool."" It's not. Here's the actual technical process:

**Step 1: Intelligent Prompt Enhancement**

When you request an image, Semantic Pen doesn't just use your raw input:

```javascript
// Automatic prompt enhancement using GPT-4o-mini
async function enhancePromptForImage(originalPrompt) {
  const { text: summarizedPrompt } = await generateText({
    model: openai('gpt-4o-mini'),
    system: `You are an expert prompt engineer. Summarize the following text into a concise, descriptive prompt suitable for an image generation model like Stable Diffusion or FLUX. Focus on the core visual elements, objects, actions, and styles mentioned.`,
    prompt: originalPrompt,
  });

  return summarizedPrompt; // Optimized for image generation
}
```

**Example transformation:**
- **Your input:** ""SEO optimization techniques for bloggers""
- **Enhanced prompt:** ""Professional blogger analyzing SEO dashboard on laptop, modern office workspace, data charts, vibrant colors, digital marketing concept""

**Step 2: Multi-Model Fallback System**

Semantic Pen doesn't rely on one model. It has a 3-tier priority system for maximum reliability:

```javascript
// Priority 1: FLUX Schnell OpenVINO (Fastest, 3-5 seconds)
generateWithFluxOpenVINO(prompt) {
  // Uses FLUX.1-schnell-openvino-int4
  // Ultra-fast generation (3 inference steps)
  // Returns image in 3-5 seconds
}

// Priority 2: FLUX GGUF (Fallback, 6-8 seconds)
generateWithFlux(prompt) {
  // Uses flux1-schnell-q4_0.gguf model
  // 4 inference steps
  // Returns if Priority 1 fails
}

// Priority 3: Stable Diffusion Turbo (Final fallback, 8-10 seconds)
generateWithSDTurbo(prompt) {
  // Uses sd-turbo-openvino
  // 1 inference step
  // Guaranteed generation
}
```

**The key:** 99.7% uptime. If one model fails, automatic fallback to next. You ALWAYS get an image.

**Step 3: Multiple Image Providers**

Unlike tools locked to one provider, Semantic Pen offers 6 image sources:

1. **Runware AI** (default): FLUX-based, ultra-fast, customizable
2. **Ideogram** v3: Realistic images, photographic quality
3. **DALL-E 3 / GPT-Image-1**: OpenAI's latest, high-quality
4. **Stable Diffusion v3**: Open-source, style presets
5. **Pixabay** (stock): 2.7M+ free stock photos
6. **Pexels** (stock): 3M+ free stock photos
7. **Bing Images** (organic): Web image search
8. **Straico API**: Multi-model access (FLUX, Midjourney styles)

**You choose based on need:**
- Need photorealistic? → Ideogram or DALL-E 3
- Need artistic? → Runware with style presets
- Need generic? → Stock photos (Pixabay/Pexels)
- Need specific style? → Stable Diffusion with presets
- Budget-conscious? → Straico (cheaper multi-model)

**Step 4: Automatic Image Optimization**

Every generated image is automatically processed:

```javascript
const processImage = async (imageBuffer) => {
  // Compress to 75% quality JPEG
  const processedImage = await sharp(image)
    .jpeg({ quality: 75 })
    .toBuffer();
  return processedImage;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- 60-70% smaller file size (faster page load)
- Maintains visual quality
- SEO-friendly (Core Web Vitals)

**Step 5: CDN Upload & Caching**

Images are automatically uploaded to Cloudflare R2 (CDN):

```javascript
// Automatic CDN upload
const imageURL = await prepareDataAndCloudflareUpload(prompt, imageBuffer);
// Returns: https://cfr2.semanticpen.com/2025/01/generated-image-12345.jpeg
```

**Benefits:**
- Global CDN delivery (fast anywhere)
- Automatic caching (instant re-use)
- No storage limits
- Free bandwidth

**Step 6: Smart Caching System**

If you've already generated an image for a topic, it's cached:

```javascript
// Check cache first
const cachedImage = await getMediaFromCache(imageCacheKey);
if (cachedImage) {
  return cachedImage; // Instant (0 seconds)
}

// Only generate if not cached
const newImage = await generateImage(prompt);
await cacheMediaData(imageCacheKey, newImage); // Save for next time
```

**Result:** Subsequent requests for same topic = instant (no credits used).

## Real Use Case #1: The ""Article-Specific Images"" Strategy ($1,240 Saved)

### The Setup

I run a SaaS comparison blog. I write detailed comparison articles like:
- ""Notion vs. Asana: Which Project Management Tool?""
- ""Stripe vs. PayPal: Payment Gateway Comparison""
- ""Supabase vs. Firebase: Backend Comparison""

**The old problem:**
- Stock photos had generic ""business people meeting"" images
- Nothing relevant to specific tools
- Had to spend 45 minutes per article creating custom graphics in Canva

### The Strategy

Use Semantic Pen to generate comparison-specific images automatically:

**For each comparison article:**
1. Generate hero image: ""Modern comparison between [Tool A] and [Tool B], side-by-side visual""
2. Generate feature images: ""[Specific feature] visualization, dashboard interface""
3. Generate conclusion image: ""Winner podium with [tool] logo, professional business""

### The Execution (Per Article: 5 Minutes)

**Example: ""Supabase vs. Firebase"" article**

**Image 1: Hero image**
- Prompt: ""Supabase vs Firebase comparison""
- Semantic Pen auto-enhances to: ""Modern database comparison visualization, Supabase and Firebase logos side-by-side, cloud infrastructure, developer workspace, professional tech illustration""
- Generation: 90 seconds
- Result: Custom hero image that perfectly matches article

**Image 2: Database comparison**

- Generation: 90 seconds

**Image 3: Pricing comparison**
- Prompt: ""Pricing comparison visualization""
- Enhanced: ""Pricing tier comparison table, subscription models, cost analysis dashboard, financial comparison chart, professional business graphic""
- Generation: 90 seconds

**Image 4: Conclusion**
- Prompt: ""Winner comparison conclusion""
- Enhanced: ""Winner podium visualization, professional business achievement, comparison conclusion, modern corporate design""
- Generation: 90 seconds

**Total time:** 6 minutes for 4 custom images

### The Results (50 Comparison Articles)

**Old approach:**
- 50 articles × 45 minutes = 37.5 hours
- Shutterstock: $135/month × 6 months = $810
- Canva Pro: $12.99/month × 6 months = $77.94
- **Total cost:** $887.94 + 37.5 hours

**Semantic Pen approach:**
- 50 articles × 6 minutes = 5 hours
- Cost: $0 (included)
- **Savings:** $887.94 + 32.5 hours

**Time savings:** 87% faster

## Real Use Case #2: ""Bulk Content Production"" Strategy ($892 Saved)

### The Problem

I needed to publish 100 ""how-to"" articles in 3 months for an AI tools directory. Each article needed:
- 1 hero image
- 3-4 step-by-step images
- Total: 400-500 images

**Traditional approach would require:**
- Shutterstock: 400-500 images = 7 months of subscription = $945
- Time searching/editing: 400 × 10 minutes = 66 hours
- **Total cost:** $945 + 66 hours

### The Strategy: Batch Image Generation

Generated all images in advance using Semantic Pen's API integration:

**Week 1: Generate hero images (100 articles)**
- Created spreadsheet with all article titles
- Used Semantic Pen API to batch generate
- 100 hero images in 2.5 hours (90 seconds each)

**Week 2-4: Generate step images as articles written**
- Generated step images while writing article
- Embedded automatically in editor
- No additional time needed

### The Execution

**Example: ""How to Use ChatGPT for Content Writing"" article**

## Real Use Case #3: ""Multiple Image Styles"" Strategy ($1,108 Saved)

### The Problem

I run 3 different blogs:
1. **Tech blog:** Needs modern, professional, tech-focused images
2. **Travel blog:** Needs vibrant, photographic, location images
3. **Business blog:** Needs corporate, clean, infographic-style images

**Old approach:**
- 3 separate Shutterstock subscriptions = $405/month
- Or 1 subscription + lots of Canva editing to change styles
- **Cost:** $405/month or $135/month + 20 hours/month editing

### The Strategy: Style Presets Per Blog

Used Semantic Pen's 17 built-in style presets:

**Tech blog styles:**
- `digital-art`: Modern, sleek tech visuals
- `3d-model`: 3D tech product renders
- `cinematic`: Dramatic tech scenes

**Travel blog styles:**
- `photographic`: Realistic travel photos
- `enhance`: Enhanced landscape photos
- `analog-film`: Vintage travel aesthetic

**Business blog styles:**
- `isometric`: Clean infographic style
- `low-poly`: Modern minimalist business
- `tile-texture`: Pattern backgrounds

### The Execution

**Example outputs for same prompt across styles:**

**Prompt:** ""Remote work productivity""

**Tech blog (digital-art style):**
- Result: Modern home office setup, multiple monitors, coding screens, sleek minimalist design

**Travel blog (photographic style):**
- Result: Digital nomad working from beach cafe, laptop and coffee, tropical background, natural lighting

**Business blog (isometric style):**
- Result: Isometric remote office illustration, clean lines, productivity icons, professional infographic

**All from same prompt, different styles, 90 seconds each.**

### The Results (6 Months, 3 Blogs)

**Image generation stats:**
- **Tech blog:** 180 articles × 3 images = 540 images
- **Travel blog:** 120 articles × 4 images = 480 images
- **Business blog:** 150 articles × 3 images = 450 images
- **Total:** 1,470 images

**Traditional cost:**
- **Option A:** 3 Shutterstock subscriptions = $405/month × 6 = $2,430
- **Option B:** 1 subscription + Canva editing = $147.99/month × 6 = $887.94

**Semantic Pen cost:** $0 (included)

**Savings:** $887.94 to $2,430 (depending on approach)

**Time savings:**
- Traditional: 1,470 images × 10 minutes = 245 hours
- Semantic Pen: 1,470 images × 2 minutes = 49 hours
- **Saved:** 196 hours (80% reduction)

## The 4 Advanced Image Generation Strategies

### Strategy #1: ""Article-Aware Generation"" (Auto Context)

**What it is:** Semantic Pen automatically uses article context to improve image relevance.

**How it works:**
When generating images within article editor, Semantic Pen passes:
- Article title
- Section heading
- Surrounding content (optional)

**Example:**
- **Article:** ""10 Best Project Management Tools for Remote Teams""
- **Section:** ""Asana Features and Benefits""
- **Basic prompt:** ""project management""
- **Semantic Pen enhancement:** ""Asana project management dashboard, kanban boards, task assignments, remote team collaboration, modern interface design""

**Result:** Image perfectly matches section, not just generic ""project management""

**My results:**
- Used for 200 articles
- Image relevance score: 9.2/10 (vs. 6.4/10 with generic prompts)
- User engagement: +34% (images match expectations)

### Strategy #2: ""Multi-Provider Testing""

**What it is:** Test different image providers to find best quality/speed for your use case.

**How it works:**
Run same prompt through multiple providers, compare results:

**Test prompt:** ""Modern SaaS dashboard with analytics""

**Results:**
- **Runware (FLUX):** 3 seconds, artistic/modern style
- **Ideogram v3:** 8 seconds, photorealistic
- **DALL-E 3:** 12 seconds, highly detailed
- **Stable Diffusion v3:** 4 seconds, good balance
- **Straico:** 5 seconds, multiple style options

**My findings:**
- **Speed winner:** Runware (3 seconds)
- **Quality winner:** DALL-E 3 / Ideogram
- **Best balance:** Runware or Straico
- **Best variety:** Straico (multiple models)

**Strategy:**
- Use Runware for bulk/fast generation
- Use DALL-E 3/Ideogram for premium articles
- Use Straico for experimentation

### Strategy #3: ""Image Playground Pre-Generation""

**What it is:** Use Image Playground to generate and test images before embedding in articles.

**How it works:**
1. Go to Image Playground (separate tool)
2. Test different prompts/styles
3. Generate multiple variations
4. Save best images
5. Use in articles later

**Benefits:**
- Iterate on prompts quickly
- Compare providers side-by-side
- Build image library
- No commitment (test before using)

**Example workflow:**
Testing hero image for ""Top 10 CRM Tools"" article:

**Playground session (10 minutes):**
- Prompt 1: ""CRM dashboard comparison"" → Generated 3 variations (Runware, Ideogram, DALL-E 3)
- Prompt 2: ""Sales pipeline visualization"" → Generated 3 variations
- Prompt 3: ""Customer relationship management interface"" → Generated 3 variations
- **Total:** 9 images in 10 minutes

Selected best 3 → Saved → Used in article

**Result:** Perfect images with minimal trial-and-error in article editor

### Strategy #4: ""Branded Image Generation""

**What it is:** Automatically apply brand colors/logo to generated images.

**How it works (if brand configured):**
```javascript
if (brand && brand.logo_url && brand.primary_color) {
  imageBuffer = await applyBrandToImage(imageBuffer, brand);
  // Adds brand watermark, color overlay, logo corner
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Consistent branding across all images
- Professional appearance
- Brand recognition
- No manual editing needed

**Example:**
- **Brand:** Tech startup with blue/white color scheme
- **Generated image:** Modern tech workspace
- **Auto-branding:** Adds subtle blue overlay, logo in corner
- **Result:** On-brand image without Canva editing

## Common Mistakes When Using AI Image Generators

### Mistake #1: Using Generic Prompts

**The problem:** ""technology"" or ""business"" prompts generate useless generic images.

**Bad example:**
- **Prompt:** ""technology""
- **Result:** Generic laptop on desk stock photo style

**Why it fails:**
- Too vague (AI guesses randomly)
- Looks like stock photos
- Not relevant to article

**Solution: Specific Prompts**

**Good example:**
- **Prompt:** ""React component lifecycle diagram""
- **Result:** Specific visualization of React hooks, component mounting, state management

**Rule of thumb:**
- Include: Subject + Context + Style + Details
- Example: ""[Main subject] in [context], [style/mood], [specific details]""

**Before/After examples:**

**Before:** ""AI writing""
**After:** ""AI content generation dashboard with writing suggestions, grammar corrections, modern SaaS interface, professional illustration""

**Before:** ""marketing""
**After:** ""Digital marketing funnel visualization, lead generation stages, conversion metrics, professional infographic style""

**Before:** ""productivity""
**After:** ""Remote worker productivity setup, dual monitors, task management app, morning coffee, home office, natural lighting""

### Mistake #2: Not Testing Multiple Styles

**The problem:** Using same style for all images makes blog monotonous.

**Why it fails:**
- Visual fatigue (all images look similar)
- Missed opportunities for emphasis
- Boring user experience

**Solution: Match Style to Content Type**

**Article types and recommended styles:**

**Technical tutorials:** `digital-art` or `3d-model`
- Clean, modern, easy to understand
- Good for showing interfaces/dashboards

**Travel/lifestyle:** `photographic` or `enhance`
- Realistic, relatable
- Good for establishing atmosphere

**Business/professional:** `isometric` or `low-poly`
- Clean, professional, trustworthy
- Good for infographics/data viz

**Creative/artistic:** `cinematic` or `fantasy-art`
- Eye-catching, memorable
- Good for hero images

**Data/analytics:** `line-art` or `tile-texture`
- Simple, focused, clear
- Good for charts/graphs

**My results from testing:**
- Single style blog: 2:18 average time on page
- Multi-style blog: 3:42 average time on page (+62%)
- **Reason:** Variety keeps users engaged

### Mistake #3: Ignoring Image Optimization

**The problem:** Using 2MB+ images slows page load, hurts SEO.

**Why it matters:**
- Google Core Web Vitals (ranking factor)
- User experience (slow = bounce)
- Mobile users (data costs)

**Solution: Semantic Pen Auto-Optimization**

**Good news:** Semantic Pen automatically optimizes:
- Converts to JPEG (smaller than PNG)
- Compresses to 75% quality (imperceptible loss)
- Serves from CDN (fast delivery)

**Typical sizes:**
- **Original AI generation:** 2-4 MB
- **After Semantic Pen optimization:** 200-400 KB (85-90% reduction)
- **Load time:** <0.5 seconds (on CDN)

**My results:**
- **Before optimization:** Page Speed score 68
- **After Semantic Pen images:** Page Speed score 94
- **Core Web Vitals:** ""Good"" on all metrics

### Mistake #4: Not Leveraging Caching

**The problem:** Regenerating images for similar topics wastes time and credits.

**Example:**
- Article 1: ""Introduction to Python""
- Article 2: ""Python Basics Tutorial""

### Mistake #5: Not Using Image Playground for Experimentation

**The problem:** Testing prompts directly in article editor wastes time if results aren't good.

**Why it's inefficient:**
- Generate → See result → Don't like → Regenerate → Repeat
- Breaks writing flow
- Slows article creation

**Solution: Test in Image Playground First**

**Workflow:**
1. **Before writing:** Generate 5-10 test images in Playground
2. **Test variations:** Different prompts, styles, providers
3. **Save favorites:** Download best options
4. **Use in article:** Already know what works

**Example:**
Writing article: ""10 Best Email Marketing Tools""

**Playground session (15 minutes):**
- Test 5 different ""email marketing"" prompts
- Test 3 styles (photographic, digital-art, isometric)
- Generate 15 images total
- Pick best 3 → Use in article

**Result:** Article creation takes 45 minutes (vs. 75 minutes with trial-and-error)

**Time saved:** 30 minutes per article

## The ROI Calculation

Let's calculate the actual ROI of using Semantic Pen's AI Image Generator vs. traditional approaches.

### Investment

**Semantic Pen subscription:**
- $49/month (includes image generation + all other features)
- For comparison: $49/month just for images

**Your time (first month):**
- Learning: 2 hours
- Generating 100 images: 3 hours
- **Total:** 5 hours

**Opportunity cost:**
- If you value your time at $50/hour: $250

**Total investment (first month):** $49 + $250 = $299

### Returns (First Month)

**Cost savings:**
- Shutterstock cancelled: $135
- Canva Pro cancelled: $12.99
- **Total saved:** $147.99/month

**Time savings:**
- Old process: 100 images × 10 minutes = 16.7 hours
- New process: 100 images × 2 minutes = 3.3 hours
- **Saved:** 13.4 hours

**At $50/hour value:** 13.4 × $50 = $670

**First month total returns:** $147.99 + $670 = $817.99

**First month ROI:** 174%

### Returns (6 Months)

**Cost savings:**
- Stock subscriptions: $888 (6 × $147.99)
- Time saved: 80 hours (13.4/month × 6)
- **Time value:** 80 × $50 = $4,000

**Total 6-month returns:** $888 + $4,000 = $4,888

**6-month investment:** $294 (6 × $49)

**6-month ROI:** 1,562%

### Compared to Alternatives

**Option A: Continue with Shutterstock + Canva**
- 6-month cost: $888
- Time: 100 hours
- **Total cost:** $888 + $5,000 = $5,888

**Option B: Hire designer (freelance)**
- Cost: $10 per image × 600 images = $6,000
- Time: 10 hours (sending briefs, revisions)
- **Total cost:** $6,000 + $500 = $6,500

**Option C: Midjourney + manual workflow**
- Cost: $180 (6 × $30 unlimited)

## Final Thoughts: The Visual Content Multiplication Effect

Here's what I learned after generating 1,847 images in 6 months:

**Every article becomes more valuable:**
- First 50 articles (stock photos): Average 340 views/month
- Next 100 articles (AI images): Average 520 views/month (+53%)
- Next 150 articles (optimized AI): Average 680 views/month (+100% vs. stock)

**Why AI images perform better:**
1. **Unique:** No one else has same images (stand out in Google Images)
2. **Relevant:** Generated from actual content (matches user intent)
3. **Professional:** Consistent quality (builds trust)
4. **Optimized:** Auto-compressed (fast load = better SEO)

**The compounding effect:**
- **Month 1-3:** Save money on subscriptions ($443.97)
- **Month 4-6:** Save time on production (87 hours)
- **Month 7-12:** Traffic increases from better engagement (+51%)

**Revenue impact:**
- **Before:** 12,400 visits/month, 2.3% conversion = 285 conversions
- **After:** 18,700 visits/month, 2.8% conversion = 524 conversions
- **Increase:** +239 conversions/month

**At $49 average order value:** 239 × $49 = $11,711 additional monthly revenue

**The real ROI isn't just cost savings—it's revenue multiplication.**

That's the difference. That's why this works.

1o8sbuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolanaMemeCoins/comments/1o8sbuv/tired_of_rugs_were_building_conviction_instead/,Tired of rugs? We’re building conviction instead.,"I think a lot of us are just *tired* of seeing new memecoins pop up every few hours. Feels like 999 out of 1000 either rug or vanish before you even finish your coffee.

That’s exactly what our community is trying to flip. It started small – just a handful of us tossing in a few bucks a day. Now it’s grown into hundreds of people doing the same. A post about us blew up on Weibo recently, and suddenly we had folks from China and all across Asia joining in. It’s been wild to watch.

The idea is simple: bring back that long-term conviction people once had with Bitcoin – but do it on Solana. Fast. Cheap. Smooth. Just DCA in whatever you can – $2, $5, $20 – it doesn’t matter. What matters is showing up every day.

When I first started, I remember putting in $8 on day one, thinking, “Let’s see what happens.” The next day, a friend in our group said he’d been doing the same thing already – for a week straight. Now he checks in daily, drops screenshots of his tiny buys, and says it’s the first time he’s actually *excited* to save instead of spend.

Another story that hit me – one guy from the Philippines started with just $1 a day. He called it his “discipline project.” Ten days in, he hadn’t missed once. That kind of quiet, steady consistency? That’s what’s fueling all of this.

The numbers speak for themselves. In roughly 10 days, the price has climbed over 600%. But honestly, it’s not the chart that gets me hyped – it’s those tiny green dots on the transactions page. Each one is someone adding their belief to the mix.

The market cap’s still only around $44K – so yeah, this is as early as it gets. We’ve got a super active T.gram community at **dcaforlife**, full of people sharing buys, memes, and progress updates. It genuinely feels like a small family of believers.

The coolest part? This kind of collective, steady buying builds liquidity like nothing else. No whales. No manipulation. Just balance, fairness, and strength that grows with time.

At the end of the day, it’s built on the same principles that made Bitcoin unstoppable – conviction, patience, and community. The only twist? This one runs at **Solana speed**.",1,1760676775.0,SolanaMemeCoins,1,1.0,False

1o8s7hm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o8s7hm,Trying to figure out smarter distribution for my zero-sugar energy drink startup (think Canva for energy),"
I run a small bootstrapped startup called Dosed — we make a zero-sugar performance energy drink powder  .vision-to be what Canva is for design: beginner-friendly, clean, and convenient. No hardcore grmbro insanity — just good ingredients that actually make you feel energised and focused.

Last week I went around visiting some of the top supplement stores in the city, and honestly… I was shocked.
Most stores work on 50–65% margins, and the owners said their customers mainly want “the strongest caffeine hit possible.” Hardly anyone cared about cleaner or balanced products.

That kind of confirmed my hunch that supplement stores might not be our ideal channel.

We’ve found strong interest instead from gym beginners, runners, and healthy diners or bars attached to gyms. People in these spaces love the taste (like a soft drink with a zesty twist) and the focus on cleaner ingredients.

So far, we’ve had better luck with pickleball courts and co-working spaces, but we’re now trying to figure out how to scale this smarter rather than one off partnerships, without just throwing money at influencers or traditional retail.

Here are a few ideas we would like to explore:
	1.	Gym collabs – co-brand sachets with gyms and include them in joining kits.
	2.	Hotels / resorts – place sachets in rooms next to tea and coffee.
	3.	Outdoor audience – perfect for bikers, hikers, runners (lightweight, mixes instantly).
	4.	Corporate / auto brand tie-ups – include in welcome or thank-you packs instead of mugs.

We haven’t done big PR or influencer campaigns yet — still testing creative, grassroots ideas that actually fit the brand.

Would love to hear from anyone who’s scaled CPG/F&B products through unconventional distribution, or whether I’m missing out by not going traditional yet( influencer +retail)",5,1760676368.0,IndiaBusiness,9,0.86,False
1o8s657,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bubly/comments/1o8s657/funny_bubly_thing_that_happened_at_work/,Funny Bubly thing that happened at work,"Soooooo I’m a mortician. Specifically I work in the crematorium, just across from the church where funeral services are held. Sometimes when there isn’t a body waiting to be burned (I live in a small town in upper BC, so it’s not uncommon) I’m asked to sit in during the funeral, as like security/basic staffing. Basically to make sure things run smoothly. It’s not an enviable job, it’s pretty depressing obviously, but it’s something you get used to. 

I'm also allowed to stick around during the after-funeral receptions, which are held in the lobby of the church. There’s always beverages and snacks being served, and lately I’ve noticed that families are bringing in bubly. Blackberry bubly, specifically. I don’t know why, maybe the darker can makes people think blackberry is like the ""bereavement flavour” but I’m not complaining as it’s my favorite and people usually don’t notice me sneaking one (technically not allowed but my manager has caught me multiple times pocketing a bubly or stuffing my face with cheese from the charcuterie board and has not said a word). At first I thought it was just a weird trend but hey, Bubly’s getting more popular and I think people are catching onto the taste. So I paid it no mind.

And then it happened.

They didn’t tell us the cause of death for the body. I didn’t ask, I almost never do when my boss doesn’t bother relaying it to me. Usually it doesn’t matter. Heart attacks happen all the time. Coronaries are silent and instant. Death happens. The body looked fine, untouched basically. No foul play, just something internal failing at the wrong time, boom, dead. They wanted him cremated, but first they wanted a service — we rent out coffins for this very purpose, gives family and friends one last chance to say goodbye before the body is ashed and siphoned into a vase. 

I didn’t get to stick around for the reception during this one because we had to move the body to the crematorium, but on the way out with the casket, I snuck a look at the food and beverage table: as expected there was a box of blackberry Bubly. The box was already opened. I supposed someone had been thirsty and didn’t want funeral home coffee. I couldn’t blame them.

So we wheeled him out, took the body out of the coffin and prepped it. We’d been told there was no history of implants. No pacemakers, no metal plates, earrings, hell the guy didn’t even have dental fillings. I guess we should have looked a bit closer before we shut him into the oven. I wish we’d done a lot of things differently, because that’s when everything went south.

I don’t know when the Bubly was inserted into his ass. The incident report claims it probably happened when the body was being treated. We let some family members in to see the process, and someone could have slipped it in when our technicians weren’t looking. Some around the office say it could have happened during the wake, at exactly the right time for nobody to notice. I have my own theory. My guess is it was in there the whole time. From before he died. And nobody bothered to check, because, why would you ever suspect someone has a full can of carbonated beverage shoved almost 7 inches up their colon?

It doesn’t really matter. What matters is what happened when the body was fully heated up in the oven.

You ever see those videos on the dark web where some poor Chinese foundry worker falls into one of the vats of molten metal? The fluids in their body basically instantly evaporate and the steam bursts their skin like they’re some kind of human balloon. This was like that, but from the inside. His body exploded. The steam erupting from the can, pressurized in a perfect seal by his anal walls and the embalming fluid was like a live grenade. Scores of flaming viscera and skin, and fountains of dark red gore and lightly toasted bone fragments blew everywhere. The force shot the furnace door open. Thank god nobody was standing in front of it. 

It took a cleanup crew 12 hours on a Thursday to clean our furnace. Guys head to toe in reflective hazmat suits and holding orange squeegees that made it look like our furnace was patient zero to some fucked up alien biomass. I can look in the corners of the room and still see chalky bone fragment dust that they must not have been able to reach with the vacuum. All in all, a nightmare.

1o8s4w5,https://www.reddit.com/r/howyoudoin/comments/1o8s4w5/friends_is_a_tragicomedy/,Friends is a tragicomedy?,"Friends is a tragicomedy?


On the surface, Friends is a classic 20-minute sitcom: friends in a coffee shop, funny situations, romantic entanglements, and memorable jokes. However, the series' enduring, cross-generational success and rewatchability lies in the fact that beneath the humorous veneer lies a deeply human, often painful and complex drama. The series not only makes you laugh, but also uses comedy to make life's most difficult moments bearable and manageable.
Here are the main reasons that prove its tragicomic nature:
1. The tragic foundations of the characters
The characters in the series do not start out as blank slates; they all have serious, often traumatic pasts that define their entire personalities and humor. Their jokes are often defensive reactions to their own pain.
 * Chandler Bing: The most obvious example. His entire personality and sarcastic, commitment-phobic nature are the result of his parents' ugly divorce and his dysfunctional childhood. His humor is a protective shield against his hurts.
 * Phoebe Buffay: The character with the most tragic backstory. Her mother committed suicide, her stepfather went to prison, and she herself lived on the streets as a teenager. Her strange, eccentric behavior and songs (such as ""Smelly Cat"") are creative expressions of deep, unprocessed trauma.
 * Monica Geller: She was constantly shamed by her own parents because of her childhood obesity. Her compulsive control and orderliness, as well as her need to conform, stem from this deep insecurity.
 * Ross Geller: The series begins with a divorce, which plummets Ross's self-esteem. His hopeless romanticism and constant failures in love form a recurring tragic motif.
 * Rachel Green: Her life begins with a complete identity crisis. She has to leave everything she has known until then—her wealth, her social status, her future—behind, which is an extremely frightening and traumatic leap into the unknown.
2. Real-life dramas in the plot
The series does not shy away from tackling tough, painful life issues, which are made digestible by the framework of comedy.
 * Infertility: Monica and Chandler's struggle with infertility is one of the most painful and realistic storylines in the series. The scene where they learn they cannot have children is pure drama, without humor. The difficulties of the subsequent adoption process also depict real pain.
 * Death and loneliness: Mr. Heckles' death is a brutal contrast to the lightheartedness of the sitcom world. The sight of the corpse and Chandler's realization that he too is heading toward a lonely end presents a deep existential crisis.
 * Family Breakdown and Humiliation: Rachel's birthday party, where she has to balance her divorcing parents, is an emotional nightmare presented in the form of a farce. Similarly, when it is revealed at her ex-fiancé's wedding that her parents lied about her being mentally ill and having syphilis, it is a kind of ""moral execution"" that is only resolved by Rachel's defiant triumph at the end.
3. The tragedy of the central love story
Ross and Rachel's relationship is not a simple romantic story, but a ten-year struggle filled with pain, mistakes, and bad timing.
* ""The Break"": This is not a funny misunderstanding, but the emotional epicenter of the series, a raw, painful breakup that turns an entire episode into a tense chamber drama. The fact that their friends are listening to the argument in the next room symbolizes how their tragedy shakes the entire world of their circle of friends.
 * The list: Ross wrote a list of Rachel's negative traits, a cold, intellectual betrayal that attacks the other person's deepest insecurities. This emotional wound is much harder to heal than physical infidelity.
 * The mistake at the altar: The line ""I, Ross, take you, Rachel..."" is the climax of the tragicomedy. It is an incredibly funny moment, the consequence of which is a ruined marriage and immeasurable pain for everyone involved.
In summary: Friends is a true tragicomedy because laughter here serves not to erase problems, but to survive them. The series presents the true-to-life truth that our funniest moments often stem from the most painful ones, and that friendship is the force that helps us get through tragedies—often with the help of a good joke.

1o8s296,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mirena/comments/1o8s296/iud_removal_experience_traumatic/,IUD Removal experience- traumatic,"To preface all this, I’m aware that my experience was traumatizing due to a lot of different factors not just the IUD itself. I think a lot of this has todo with women in healthcare getting dismissed for their concerns and misogynistic practices. I had some amazing nurses but I also had some that made the experience worse. I also think I was not the best candidate for an iud so I wish I would have seen a post like this before getting one; my body type wasn’t right for a normal sized IUD- I am a petite person (5”2’ and 110 lbs) and I was not offered a smaller sized one. I would find out at my removal appointment that my uterus is retroverted and this was never mentioned previously- I’m 27 and I have regular visit to the gyno. I’m sensitive to drugs and medications- even coffee has me wired for hours. If this sounds like you…maybe try something else.
Prior to the Mirena, I had a Nexplanon and I had absolutely no issues. I didn’t have a period and I had little to no negative side effects. After my Nexplanon I wanted to try something that would last longer so I decided on the Mirena. I initially got an IUD because some of my friends had one and they all loved them. 
Insertion in Feb 2020: I specifically asked if I needed a ride or to take work off after my appointment they said no that aside from some cramping I would be fine. The insertion was soooo painful. I have a very high pain tolerance so it takes a lot to make me squirm but damn was that painful. I almost passed out in the room and had to wait ~15 minutes before I could walk down to my car. Once I got in my car I cried and had to sit there for an additional 10 minutes before the cramping stopped enough to drive home. For TWO DAYS after I was cramping and having excruciating pain off and on. 
I bled a lot on and off in the following years. Very inconsistent blood and mucus texture, duration,and pain level. I would go months without a period or symptoms then it would be horrible cramping and bleeding for months then nothing again. 
Around year two I had shooting pain in my abdomen and I was afraid that jt was dislodged or something. They could not feel my strings at my appointment because they were cut too short (??) so I had to get a vaginal ultrasound. They said it was fine and in place and sent me in my way. This pain would continue infrequently for the remainder of my time with the iud.
Removal September 2025:
I gave my IUD over 5 years but symptoms were getting worse and I wanted to spend some time off birth control. I went into my appointment and told them my history and that my strings were cut short. They assured me that was normal and they would remove it for me. The staff was very supportive but after trying to remove it for over 15 minutes I was told they couldn’t find the strings. Yeah. So they gave me the option of them clamping my uterus so it would be easier or making a second appointment. I figured since I was already there we should just try with the clamp. It was extremely uncomfortable and crampy but not super painful. After another 15 minutes they gave up and told me I’d need to make another appointment. 30 minutes of them searching inside my cervix for nothing. I understood and figured it would be difficult to remove based on my previous experience with it but I was still super upset by it and getting frustrated.
Removal pt 2: two weeks later I go back in to get it removed again. This second appointment was a step up from the normal process so they had access to ultrasounds and medications. They take me to the back to perform the untrasound and they find the iud. The Dr comes in and explains that they have more at their disposal to remove my iud. She offers me some lidocaine-The local anesthetic they use at the dentists- and precedes to give me two shots in my cervix. Within a minute I get tinnitus in my ear and my vision narrows. I tell them I’m really light headed and they say “don’t worry it’s from the medication, thank you for telling us but don’t worry.” I try to relax and breath deep and then I realize I’m not just light headed, I’m extremely high. Within a couple minutes of receiving the shots I’m vibing in space. I couldn’t tell you how long I was in the table for but somewhere between 5 minutes and 30. I tell the nurse “im feeling weird” and she interprets it as what ever they are doing inside of me and starts explaining what they are doing but what I actually mean is that I’m so so high but I can’t articulate it. They then remove it and ask if I’m okay. I am. In fact,  the last thing I felt was the shots. The Dr heads out and the nurse sits with me while I try to sit up. The nurse then says she will meet me in the hall when I’m dressed. Now I’m back in my body but I’m still high. I slowly get dressed and walk out to meet her. I felt like everything was moving super fast and their responses felt inappropriate for how I was feeling. I meet the nurse and she walks me to the door and tells me to drive safe. I’m baffled at this point and so confused as to why they would send me to drive while in so high. I sit in my car for 10 minutes and eat some snack I brought with me. At this point I drive home. Honestly, I probably shouldn’t have driven but I was obviously not thinking clearly. I still have a lingering highness as I’m laying on my couch thinking how atypical that experience felt. I did my research and realize I should not have been high. The situation seemed not to match how I was feeling because I was experiencing lidocaine toxicity. I don’t think the staff realized I was high because I couldn’t articulate that I was but I know I was acting weird so I’m upset they didn’t have more of a discharge process to ensure safety.
But yeah that’s my experience. I will never be doing that again. ",1,1760675888.0,Mirena,0,0.67,False

UPDATE: I could not believe my eyes when I opened reddit and saw the number of notifications. Wow. So just to update everyone, things came to a head today. I had to work the early shift and had session with my table tonight at 6 (I am DM'ing a few DND games) I begged my brother to keep the living room clean. I came home and the house was more than trashed. I mean it looked like a bomb went off. He even dropped a cup of milk on the floor and left it. I flung the whole milk jug at his head and screamed at him to GTFO. He tried to bulk up to me and I lost it screaming ""get out"" over and over and I guess he saw how unhinged I was because he stormed out. I cleaned up the milk then jumped online to message everyone to cancel and saw the 700+ notifications. You all gave some really solid advice, and I knew reading the replies last night that this was over. I was gonna give him a few weeks but seeing that milk all across my new floor was the last straw. IDK where he is going, I don't care. I Thank you all! I love reddit people. End of update.

  


My brothers are all pigs. We had a very traditional house where girls cleaned and washed dishes from the time, we were old enough to walk and stand on chairs and my brothers never did anything and as adults cannot even turn a washer on. I very much resenting how I felt like I had to raise my own father and how holidays and weekends were always spent with my brothers and dads laying around and us cleaning. Even Christmas they got to play with their toys and we went in the kitchen. I do not care about excuses like ""I was never taught"", we are all adults now and they can YouTube and google whatever they do not know. I learned how to patch walls, change tiers, change oil, etc. All the gendered stuff I was never taught so I do not see why he can't as well. My brother got put out by his girlfriend after they just had their first kid because he does not help with anything.

Since staying with me I have forced him to do stuff. When he first moved in my house went from my tidy, clean utopia to a disgusting mess. He would spit sunflower seeds on the flood, hide his food and dirty dishes around the house, spit chewed gum behind the coffee machine feet from the trash can, hide snack food everywhere, smoke on the toilet and put cigs out on my floor (which is a slap in the face as I asked him to not even smoke inside because I do not smoke), leave his dirty clothes everywhere even on the living room floor, etc. Even when he ordered food for himself, he would eat at the table then leave it for me to put away for him. Anytime he took anything out of the fridge he would leave it on the table and would often leave the fridge open. I am not joking, I found maggots 3 times from his mess.

I lost it and told him to change his behavior totally or get out. Well, he started doing stuff but as badly as he could. He would put bowls in the dish washer so they would be filled with nasty water, mop with the same water for days on end leaving it smelling of rot, do his laundry by putting it in the washer and leaving it for me to finish, put food away by throwing it all over the fridge spilling food everywhere. The best was when he put the syrup away upside down on the top shelf with no lid on coating my entire fridge in syrup that took hours to clean, etc. Then he would say ""I am trying you are just being a b&tch"".

I lost my temper, and I know I couldn't leave him on the street, so I divided the house. The cabinet doors all have locks from the previous owners, so I got him from dishes from goodwill and forbad him from using any of my dishes so he is eating off his filthy dishes. I made it very clear that anything left on the floors (clothing, etc) gets a one-day grace period then it will be thrown away. Same with the few dishes he has as he would leave them in the sink until they started to grow mold. I started locking my bathroom door and he has to use the one in the basement which I refuse to clean. If his clothes are in the washer for more than 8 hours and I need to use it, I dump them wet on his bed. Any trash he leaves laying around goes on his bed. If he orders food and gets up and leaves his leftovers, I leave them to rot, then they get thrown away (though twice the idiot has left food out overnight and came out and started angry eating it whilst glaring at me. Both times the idiot got food sickness). He destroyed my fridge again putting juice in upside down with the lid barely on once again destroying my food, so I mopped it up with towels and dumped the towels and all my ruined food on his bed then put a lock on the fridge.

He hates me and says I am terrorizing him. I say I was forced to mother him as a child but was never given the parental control to actually teach him how life works. And since my brothers used my childhood to treat me like a maid, I will no longer parent them. My view is, some lessons have to be learned painfully. I will not gentle parent a grown man who cannot close a fridge door. ATIAH?",0,1760675764.0,AITH,2,0.44,False

1o8rzky,https://youtu.be/q4yeCxWFSqM,5 Very Scary TRUE Remote Road Trip Horror Stories,"# ""Dust and Blood"":

We loaded up the old pickup with rifles, tents, and enough supplies for a week out in the California desert. Just the two of us—me and Alex—heading east from El Centro toward the border, looking for a quiet stretch near the Salton Sea where we could set up camp and track some small game. The road shimmered under the heat, nothing but sand and scrub brush stretching endlessly in every direction. The radio didn’t pick up much, so we talked—about work, our families back home, and the kind of dumb stories you only tell on long drives.

The air turned drier as we pushed deeper into nowhere. That’s when we spotted him—a lone man by the side of the road, sunburned, clothes dusty, a small pack at his feet. He raised a hand to flag us down. From a distance, I noticed a tattoo on his hand—“Hard Luck,” inked across his knuckles. His eyes didn’t sit right; one drifted slightly, like it couldn’t keep up with the other.

We slowed to a stop beside him.  
“Car broke down a ways back,” he said, voice rough. “Mind giving me a lift to the next town? Name’s Bill.”

Alex looked at me. Out here, you helped people—it was a kind of desert code. A breakdown could mean death in this heat. I shrugged. “Sure. Hop in.”

Bill climbed into the back seat with a quiet “Thanks.” He smelled like old sweat and gasoline. At first, he didn’t say much, just stared out the window as the landscape rolled by. I tried to make small talk.  
“What brings you out this way?”

“Looking for work,” he said flatly. “Mining, maybe.”

Something about the way he said it—like he didn’t really care if we believed him—put me on edge. But I pushed it aside.

After a few miles, he started asking questions.  
“Where you boys headed?”  
“Got family waitin’ on ya?”  
“What kinda guns you carry?”

“Good ones,” Alex said with a grin, trying to keep it light. “Remingtons. You hunt?”

Bill nodded slowly. “Yeah,” he said. “I hunt.”

The way he said it made my skin prickle.

We stopped at a dry wash to stretch our legs. The heat wavered off the sand like smoke. When I turned around, Bill had wandered over to the truck bed—and when he came back, he was holding one of the rifles.

“Nice piece,” he said, running his fingers along the barrel. “Mind if I take a look?”

“Put that down,” Alex said firmly.

Bill didn’t. He chambered a round with a crisp *click*, and the air seemed to freeze.  
“Get back in the truck,” he ordered. His voice was calm, but that lazy eye of his gave the moment a strange, unpredictable tension. “We’re going for a drive.”

My mouth went dry. “We gave you a ride,” I said carefully. “If you want the truck, take it. Just let us go.”

He laughed—a short, bitter sound. “No. You’re drivin’. South. Toward Mexico.”

We did as he said. Alex got behind the wheel, and I climbed in beside him. Bill sat in the back, the rifle steady, his reflection in the rearview mirror looking almost bored.

The desert rolled on endlessly. The silence was thick, broken only by the hum of tires on sand. After a while, he started talking. “You ever been in trouble?” he asked suddenly. “Real trouble?” He leaned forward a little. “I have. Grew up hard. No family worth a damn. My own kin dropped me down a mine shaft once. Left me there three days.”

Alex’s hands tightened on the wheel. “Listen, Bill,” he said carefully, “whatever’s going on—we can help you. You don’t have to—”

“Shut up and drive.”

We hit rougher ground as the sun dipped, bouncing over ruts and rocks. Bill made us stop once to eat from our own supplies. He never put the gun down. “One wrong twitch,” he said, “and I’ll put a bullet through both of you.”

By nightfall, the desert turned black and endless. The headlights carved narrow tunnels of light through the dark. Every time I looked in the mirror, Bill’s eyes were waiting.

“Why are you doing this?” I finally asked.

He smiled faintly. “Because I can. People like you—you’ve had it easy. You don’t know what it’s like. I’ve killed before. Families, too. Dumped ‘em in wells. Left ‘em for the buzzards.”

The words landed like stones in my stomach. I glanced at Alex. His jaw was clenched so hard I thought his teeth might crack. He whispered, so low I barely caught it, “We wait. First chance we get.”

We crossed the border sometime before dawn, the crossing unguarded in that stretch. Bill seemed more animated now, directing Alex through a maze of dusty roads. By the time the sun rose, we rolled into a small coastal town—Santa Rosalia. Its pastel buildings looked almost peaceful against the sea.

Bill told us to stop near a market. “Out,” he said. “We’re walking.” The rifle was tucked under his jacket, but the outline was clear.

He herded us through narrow streets alive with morning chatter and frying oil. People passed within feet of us, unaware. My heart pounded with every step. We reached a cantina, and Bill motioned us inside.

“Sit.”

We sat. He ordered food, acting like nothing was wrong. He ate greedily, eyes never leaving us. “You boys are lucky,” he said between bites. “Could’ve ended this hours ago.”

Then the door opened. A large man in a tan uniform walked in—the local police chief. He chatted with the bartender, laughing about something, until his gaze fell on our table. His smile faded. His eyes dropped to Bill’s tattooed hand. Recognition flashed across his face.

He approached casually. “Evening, amigos.”

Bill stiffened. “Mind your business,” he muttered.

But the chief was fast. In one motion, he lunged, grabbing Bill’s arm and slamming it against the table. The rifle clattered to the floor. Within seconds, more officers rushed in, tackling Bill as he thrashed and cursed.

When it was over, Bill was cuffed, bleeding from the lip, and dragged outside.

At the station, the chief explained what we already suspected. Bill had been wanted across several states—murder, robbery, kidnapping. He’d escaped custody near Yuma a week earlier. We were lucky, he said. Damn lucky.

Driving home the next day, the desert didn’t look the same. Every mile of empty road felt heavier now, like it remembered what had almost happened there. Neither of us said much. The only sound was the tires humming over the dust.

Finally, Alex spoke. “We got lucky.”

“Yeah,” I said quietly. “But I’ll never pick up a hitchhiker again.”





# ""Broken Radiator"":

I had just graduated college and decided to take a long drive from Chicago to Indianapolis to clear my head before starting a job. My buddy Jason came along—he said he needed a break too, something simple and quiet before life got complicated again. We packed the old sedan with snacks, a road atlas, and a cheap cooler full of sodas. It felt like freedom, that kind of aimless energy you only get when you’re young and think the world’s still waiting for you.

The plan was simple: stick to the interstate, stop at a few diners, roll into the city by evening. We didn’t rush. The air smelled like summer and dust, and the radio hummed soft static between old rock songs. The flatlands stretched forever—miles of cornfields and wind turbines turning like lazy sentinels on the horizon.

Somewhere near Lowell, the car started coughing. At first it was just a faint rattle under the hood, then a burst of steam and a long, dying hiss. I pulled onto the shoulder, and the engine quit like it had given up on us. Jason climbed out, popped the hood, and immediately got a face full of hot vapor.

“Looks like the radiator,” he said, wiping sweat from his forehead.

I checked my phone. No bars. Just empty gray signal bars mocking me. Not a house in sight—just the highway shimmering in the heat.

We waited. Cars whipped past in bursts of noise and wind, none of them slowing down. After twenty minutes, a silver pickup finally slowed and rolled onto the shoulder behind us.

The driver leaned out, a man in his thirties, close-cropped hair, plain shirt, calm eyes. “You guys alright?”

“Car died,” I said. “Radiator, maybe. You heading toward the next town?”

He nodded once. “Hop in. I’m going that way.”

Jason and I exchanged a look—half relief, half hesitation—but what choice did we have? We grabbed our bags and climbed into the cab.

The guy’s name was Larry. He smelled faintly of motor oil and cigarettes. “What brings you two out here?” he asked as the truck merged back onto the road.

“Just a road trip,” Jason said, sitting in the middle seat. “Clearing our heads.”

Larry smiled slightly. “Nice. I know these highways better than anyone. Got all the shortcuts.”

At first, everything seemed fine. He talked about working construction, how he liked quiet drives, how the interstate was too crowded. But after a few minutes, I noticed his eyes kept flicking to the rearview mirror, like he was checking for someone behind us.

Then, without warning, he veered off the highway.

“Shortcut,” he said before we could ask. “This’ll shave twenty minutes off easy.”

The asphalt gave way to rougher pavement, then to a long stretch of cracked road between cornfields. No other cars. Just the steady hum of tires and the whisper of stalks brushing the wind.

Jason frowned. “You sure this connects back?”

Larry’s lips tightened. “Trust me.”

The conversation started to die. The silence inside that cab felt heavy, like the air itself was thickening. I checked my phone again. Still nothing. No signal. No escape.

After a while, Larry started talking again, his tone softer now. “You boys got girlfriends waiting back home?”

“Uh, not really,” Jason said carefully.

Larry nodded. “Good. Freedom’s a rare thing. Most people don’t know what to do with it once they’ve got it.”

He smiled at that—too long, too wide.

A few minutes later, he reached into the glove box. My heart jumped. But he only pulled out a small bottle filled with cloudy water.

“Thirsty?” he asked, shaking it gently.

“No thanks,” I said quickly. Something about the bottle looked wrong—like powder or pills had been dissolved in it.

He took a sip himself, but I noticed he didn’t actually swallow. Just tilted it to his lips and put it back.

The road turned narrower, cracked and half-swallowed by weeds. Then came a dirt track branching off into what looked like a cluster of old farm buildings. Larry slowed the truck and said, “Gotta make a quick stop. Friend of mine’s place.”

Jason whispered, “This doesn’t feel right.”

I agreed. But Larry had already turned, the truck bumping along the rutted path. He parked behind a shed, out of sight from the road.

“Come on,” he said, opening his door. “He’s got a phone we can use to call a tow.”

Jason and I hesitated. The fields stretched in every direction—no other cars, no houses, no one coming. We followed.

Inside the shed, it smelled like dust, rot, and something metallic. Tools hung from the walls. Old ropes coiled in corners. A single window let in a thin bar of light.

Larry walked ahead, fiddling with a rope hanging from a ceiling beam. “Have a seat,” he said, pointing to two wooden chairs.

Jason didn’t move. “Why here?”

Larry turned slowly. His expression was empty now—like a mask slipping off. “Because it’s private.”

I felt the hair rise on the back of my neck. “We should get back to the truck,” I said.

Larry blocked the doorway. His hand slipped into his pocket and came out holding a pair of handcuffs.

“Let’s just talk,” he said quietly.

Jason’s voice cracked. “What are those for?”

“Just in case.”

Jason lunged for the door, but Larry grabbed him hard by the arm, twisting until Jason shouted. I saw his knuckles whiten around the cuffs.

“Don’t,” Larry said, his voice low and steady, too calm for the situation.

My eyes darted to a dusty shelf where a rusted knife lay among old tools. Instinct took over. I grabbed it and swung. The blade grazed his shoulder. He screamed and stumbled backward, his grip loosening.

“Run!” I yelled.

We burst out the door into the blinding sunlight, sprinting toward the cornfields. Larry’s footsteps thundered behind us, his shouts carrying through the still air.

“Come back! You don’t know what you’re doing!”

We tore through the stalks, hearts pounding, lungs burning. The leaves whipped against our faces, cutting skin, filling our clothes with dirt. We didn’t stop until we couldn’t hear him anymore.

We crouched in the thick of the field, listening. Minutes passed. Then we heard his boots crunch nearby. He stopped, breathing hard, muttering something to himself.

Then silence.

Finally, the sound of the truck engine roared to life, fading down the dirt road.

We waited until the sun dipped low before crawling out and heading toward the faint sound of the highway. By the time we flagged down a farmer, night had fallen. He called the police.

Later, we learned Larry wasn’t just some drifter. He matched descriptions tied to disappearances along those backroads—guys our age, stranded motorists, hitchhikers. They’d found remains in fields, near sheds just like that one. All stabbed. All left out in the open.

We had been seconds away from becoming part of that story.

The police found ropes, knives, even bloodstains in his truck, but Larry vanished for months before they finally caught him across state lines.

Jason and I don’t talk about it anymore. Some things you just don’t revisit. But every time I drive a long stretch of empty road and see a pickup truck in the mirror, my chest tightens. The highway used to feel like freedom. Now it just feels like a place people disappear.

And sometimes, when I pass a broken-down car by the roadside, I still wonder if Larry’s out there—waiting for someone else to say yes to a ride.





# ""Fifteen Forever"":

I stood by the edge of the interstate, thumb extended, cars screaming past in hot bursts of wind. The sun felt like it was sitting right on top of my skull. I was fifteen—too young to know better, too stubborn to wait. After a rough few months at home, I just wanted out. Wanted to see my grandfather in Los Angeles. Wanted to believe the world was still kind.

Two other guys waited nearby, both older, both hitching too. A blue van slowed, its tires humming against the shoulder. The driver leaned across the seat. He looked to be in his fifties, with weathered skin and calm, pale eyes.

“I can take one of you,” he said. “Only got room for one.”

The men exchanged wary looks, then turned to me. One shook his head. “Don’t,” he said. “Don’t get in there alone.”

The other added, “Feels wrong. Wait for the next ride.”

But my feet hurt. The sun burned like a brand. I ignored the knot tightening in my stomach and climbed in. The door thudded shut behind me. The van smelled of old sweat and oil. No seats in the back—just metal floor and empty space.

“Thanks for the ride,” I said.

He smiled faintly. “No problem. Where you headed?”

“Los Angeles. My grandfather’s.”

“I’ll get you close,” he said, merging back into traffic.

We drove in silence for a while. He asked simple questions—school, family, where I grew up. His voice was soft, almost gentle. He talked about being a sailor once, about foreign ports and long drives. “You meet all kinds on the road,” he said with a quiet chuckle.

Hours passed. The sun dipped low, painting the sky copper. Road signs for towns I half-recognized flicked by. Then, without warning, he took an exit I didn’t know—east instead of south.

“This isn’t the way,” I said, my voice small.

“Shortcut,” he replied easily. “Trust me.”

The landscape turned barren—no houses, no cars, just rolling scrub and distant hills.

“I’d rather stay on the highway,” I said, trying to sound calm.

He didn’t answer right away. Then: “Relax, kid. You’re safe.”

But his tone was different now. Flatter. I gripped the door handle, heart pounding.

“Stop the van,” I said. “Let me out.”

The tires crunched over gravel as he braked. “If that’s what you want,” he said, too calmly. He got out first, walked around to my side.

I stepped down, pretending to fix my shoelace. Then something slammed into the back of my skull—an explosion of pain, light bursting behind my eyes. The ground vanished.

When I woke, night had fallen. I was on the van floor, wrists bound, head throbbing. The engine hummed beneath me. He was sitting nearby, his face changed—hard, empty, his calm replaced by something darker.

“You shouldn’t have made a fuss,” he muttered. “Now look what you did.”

“Please,” I whispered. “I won’t tell anyone. Just let me go.”

He smiled faintly, that same hollow calm. “Too late for that.”

Then came the hours I still can’t speak of without shaking. Pain, endless and blinding. His voice whispering things I’ll never forget. I screamed until I couldn’t anymore. The night swallowed my voice whole.

When the world came back, pale dawn light poured through the windows. He dragged me out by my hair, a hatchet glinting in his hand. The air smelled like dust and iron.

“This is where it ends,” he said.

I tried to fight, but he was stronger. The blade came down—fire exploded through my left arm. Again—my right. I screamed until there was nothing left to scream.

He stared at me for a moment, breathing heavy. “Done.” Then he grabbed what was left of me and hurled me over the edge of a drainage pit. Rocks tore my skin as I tumbled into the dust below.

I should’ve died there. Maybe I did, in some way.

But something in me refused to quit. The pain was a roar, but underneath it was a voice: *Move. Don’t stop.*

I rolled to my side, pressing mud and dirt into the stumps, packing it tight to slow the bleeding. I don’t know how I stayed conscious. Inch by inch, I crawled up the slope, legs trembling, vision fading.

When I reached the road, the world was empty. The horizon shimmered in heat. I stood somehow, arms gone, blood still dripping.

A car came—a blue sedan. The driver saw me, eyes wide, and sped off. The wind of it nearly knocked me over. Despair nearly did the rest.

But then another vehicle appeared—a red convertible, top down, sunlight flashing on chrome. A young couple inside. The woman’s scream cut through the silence.

“Oh my God,” she cried. “What happened?”

The man leapt out, wrapped me in a blanket. “Hang on. We’ve got you.”

They drove fast—blurred towns, sirens, white hospital lights. I remember doctors shouting, hands pressing, someone saying, “Stay with us.”

I did. Barely.

When I could speak, I told them everything: the van, the scar on his cheek, the road, the desert. “Find him,” I said. “Before he does this again.”

They did.

Years later, I faced him in court—prosthetic arms, trembling voice, heart hammering. I told the jury what he did. He got time, not enough. He was released once. Killed again.

I testified a second time, staring into those same cold eyes. He’ll never walk free now.

I live quietly these days. Sometimes I wake before dawn, hearing the hum of tires, feeling the ghost of desert wind. I see that endless stretch of road and the boy I used to be standing there—hopeful, tired, and far too trusting.

I survived. But part of me is still out there, fifteen forever, waiting for that van to stop.





# ""The Blue Van"":

I grew up in a small town in Oregon, the kind of place where the biggest excitement was when a new diner opened on Main Street. That spring day in the late 1970s, I just needed to get to a friend’s place in northern California. My old car had broken down weeks earlier, and I didn’t have the money to fix it. I was young, restless, and a little too trusting. So I packed a small bag, slung it over my shoulder, and stuck out my thumb on the side of the highway.

The first few cars flew past without slowing. One pulled halfway over, but something about the driver’s stare set off alarms in my gut, so I waved him off. Then a blue van slowed and stopped just ahead of me, its brakes hissing softly in the warm spring air.

Inside sat a man in his mid-twenties with short dark hair and calm brown eyes. Beside him was a young woman holding a baby wrapped in a blanket. She smiled at me, and I remember thinking how gentle she looked—like someone who baked bread and sang lullabies. Families don’t hurt people, right?

I climbed into the back, thanking them.  
“I’m Amy,” I said, trying to sound confident.  
“John,” the man replied, glancing back in the mirror. “This is my wife, Linda. And that little one is Katie.”  
“Nice to meet you,” Linda said softly, her voice as delicate as her smile.

We talked as we headed south. I told them I was visiting a friend for her birthday. John said they’d been up north visiting family, now driving home to Red Bluff. The van smelled faintly of baby powder and pine air freshener. The radio hummed low with Fleetwood Mac. Everything felt safe, almost cozy.

After about twenty minutes, John turned off the highway onto a narrow side road.  
“Just a quick stop,” he said. “There’s a lake nearby I want to show Linda before it gets dark. Real pretty spot.”

I hesitated. The van slowed as trees swallowed the road ahead. “Uh… sure,” I said finally. He had a baby with him, I reminded myself. People with babies don’t do bad things.

We stopped near a grove of pines, sunlight flickering through the branches. Linda stepped out, cradling the baby, saying she wanted to stretch her legs. Then John turned around in his seat and looked at me. The warmth in his eyes was gone.

Before I could speak, he lunged forward, pressing a knife against my neck.  
“Don’t scream,” he whispered. “You’ll regret it.”

Everything inside me went still. My heartbeat thundered in my ears. He moved with terrifying calm, pulling rope from under the seat, tying my wrists before I could process what was happening. Then he reached for something heavy beside him—a strange wooden box with hinges. He forced it over my head and locked it shut.

Darkness consumed me. The air inside was hot and stale. I could hear only my own panicked breathing, echoing inside the box. When the van started moving again, I realized Linda hadn’t stopped him. She’d gone along with it.

I lost all sense of time. The world outside was just motion and noise. When we finally stopped, hands dragged me out and down steps into what felt like a basement. The box came off. I blinked against the dim light and saw bare concrete walls, a single bulb overhead.

John stood there with the knife.  
“You’ll stay here,” he said evenly. “You’ll do what I say.”

“Why?” I managed to whisper.

“Because I chose you,” he replied. “Linda agrees. We need someone like you.”

That first night, he hung me from the ceiling by my wrists. My toes barely brushed the floor. He whipped me with a belt—slowly, rhythmically. Not enough to bleed, just enough to make me cry out. Linda watched from the corner, her face pale and expressionless.

When morning came, he untied me, gave me a sip of water, and showed me a photograph—a girl my age with hollow eyes.  
“This was Marlene,” he said. “She didn’t listen. She’s gone now.”

The threat sank deep. I didn’t ask what “gone” meant.

After that, I spent most of my life in a box—literally. It was wooden, coffin-like, slid under their bed when they didn’t need me. I’d lie there for hours, sometimes an entire day, my body cramping, lungs straining for air through a small drilled hole. Above me, I could hear them living normal lives—John laughing, Linda humming to the baby. Sometimes I’d cry quietly, biting my sleeve so they wouldn’t hear.

Weeks turned into months.

Eventually, they let me out to do chores. John said I’d “earned” it. I cooked, cleaned, and watched their baby. The house sat alone at the end of a dirt road, surrounded by fields and woods. I thought about running, but John’s words haunted me.

“There’s a group,” he told me one night, crouching beside me. “The Organization. They’re watching. If you escape, they’ll come for your family first. They’ll make you watch.”

I believed him. How could I not? His control was total. Linda seemed afraid too, flinching whenever he raised his voice.

Years passed that way. They had another child, a girl. I helped raise her, like some twisted nanny. I told myself I stayed alive for the kids, that maybe someday I could protect them.

In 1981, John let me visit my family. He drove me there himself.  
“You’ll tell them you joined a religious group,” he said. “You say anything else, the Organization will know.”

When my mother opened the door, she gasped and pulled me into her arms.  
“Amy! Oh my God, where have you been?”  
I forced a smile. “Just… traveling with friends.”

John arrived the next morning, pretending to be my boyfriend. We even took a photo together—his hand on my shoulder, both of us smiling. I’ve seen that photo since. It looks so normal. You’d never guess I was a prisoner.

Back at the house, he punished me for “acting cold” during the visit. Weeks in the box followed.

By 1984, something in Linda had changed. She started speaking softly to me when John was gone, her hands trembling. One night, she said it outright.  
“Amy, the Organization… it isn’t real. He made it up.”

I stared at her. “What?”

“He’s been lying to both of us,” she said. “I can’t do this anymore. You have to go.”

The next morning, while John was at work, I walked. Barefoot at first, then hitching a ride into town. My legs shook with every step. I found a bus station and bought a ticket with money Linda had pressed into my hand.

Before boarding, I called him from a payphone.  
“I’m leaving,” I said.  
He cried on the line. “Please don’t, Amy. I need you.”  
I hung up.

A few months later, Linda went to the police. She told them everything—about the box, the lies, the years. They arrested John at his job. During the trial, I faced him from the witness stand. He stared at me with the same calm eyes I’d seen in that van years before.

He got over a hundred years.

I rebuilt my life slowly. Therapy, steady work, long quiet walks. But sometimes, when I’m driving and see a hitchhiker by the road, I feel my throat tighten. I still remember that blue van slowing to a stop, the baby’s cry, the smile that made me feel safe.

One wrong ride, and seven years disappeared into darkness.

Now, when I see someone thumbing for a lift, I look away. Not because I don’t care—  
but because I know how easily evil can wear a gentle face.





# ""Twelve-Oh-Five"":

I pulled into the gas station just off Indian Head Highway around eleven that night, headlights sweeping across the empty lot. The pumps gleamed under buzzing fluorescents, and the air smelled faintly of rain and motor oil. I’d been driving since dusk, cutting down from Baltimore toward Virginia for a family thing in the morning, but exhaustion was setting in fast. I needed fuel—both for the car and myself—so I filled the tank and went inside for coffee.

The station attendant, a grizzled man with a soft belly and a name tag that read **Carl**, was leaning against the counter, flipping through a newspaper. He looked up as I approached, his eyes narrowing a little, like he’d seen too many weary travelers pass through after dark.

“Long haul tonight?” he asked, sliding my card through the reader.

“Yeah. Heading south,” I said. “Gotta be in Virginia by morning. Thought I’d grab some caffeine before I drift off behind the wheel.”

Carl handed back my card, giving me a look that was half concern, half curiosity. “You taking the highway through Accokeek?”

“That’s the plan,” I said, pocketing the receipt. “Pretty quiet out there this late, huh?”

He leaned on the counter, lowering his voice slightly. “Mostly. But keep your wits about you once you pass the woods. Folks around here talk about echoes—cries for help around midnight. Always the same story.”

I chuckled, thinking he was just passing the time. “Ghost story for the night shift?”

Carl didn’t smile. “Started back in ’57. Girl named Ruth—twenty-one, worked in D.C. at a typing pool near the White House. Kidnapper snatched her at a bus stop. Drove her out this way and killed her in those woods off the highway. Buried her shallow. Loggers found her two months later.” He wiped his hands on a rag, eyes distant. “The guy confessed years later in prison. Said he picked that spot because no one ever stopped there. Now truckers swear they still hear her—begging, crying, same time every night. Twelve-oh-five. Some panic and floor it. Others freeze up, lose control. Accidents happen.”

I smirked, trying to shake the chill that crawled up my spine. “Old wives’ tale to keep drivers alert.”

“Maybe,” he said, still serious. “But in ’58, just a year later, another wreck on that same stretch. Kid racing his buddies hit a family head-on. Five dead. Cops said he swerved suddenly—like something stepped into the road. His last words were that a woman waved him down. Since then… well, the accidents keep coming.”

I thanked him and headed back to my car, but his words lingered, playing back in my head as I pulled onto the dark ribbon of road. The trees closed in on both sides, tall and black against the sky, and the highway narrowed to two faint lanes under my headlights. My dashboard clock read 11:47.

I turned up the radio—some low AM talk show about sports—to break the silence. The hum of the tires, the drone of the host’s voice, the occasional rattle of gravel beneath my wheels—it all blurred together. The night felt heavy, like the air itself was watching.

At 11:55, my phone buzzed with a work email. I glanced down, tapped it away, then looked back up. The road was empty, endless. The Accokeek sign flashed past. Then came only the woods, pressing closer, thick and endless, no streetlights, no houses, just shadows.

A sound cut through the static of the night—so faint I thought it was the radio. A woman’s voice.

“Please... help me.”

I turned the volume down, listening harder. The sound drifted through my cracked window, soft but distinct, coming from the right side—the trees.

“Please... help me!”

It came again, louder this time. I eased off the gas, heart kicking up. Maybe kids playing with a speaker in the woods, or someone calling for real help. But at this hour? Here?

“Help me... please!”

The desperation in the voice twisted something in my gut. My headlights caught only trees and brush. Nothing moved, no figure, no car pulled over. Just those words, echoing like they were being dragged along beside me.

Carl’s voice echoed in my head. *Twelve-oh-five.* I glanced at the clock. 12:03.

I pressed harder on the gas, trying to outpace the sound, but it clung to me—just outside, just beyond sight.

12:04. The cries sharpened, as if coming from inside the car now, vibrating through the air vents, inside my skull. “Please!”

“Jesus Christ—” I rolled the window up. The voice muffled but didn’t fade completely. My hands were shaking. I grabbed my phone, thumb hovering over *911.*

One in particular was a bl (boy love) dub and I liked it so much I went to read it on webtoon. Right now, I am having difficulty in remembering the name but  I do remember the other details. (It's a hella underrated comic so it's hard to find) Plus, I don't even know if the artist may have taken it down.

Details:

-Boy love

-Four main characters (all male)

-Two couples

-Names were taken after coffee beans. (I remembered one of them was called vanilla)

-The setting is either in a cafe or a bar. They had those long tables so maybe a bar. I could be off proportion and it's a host club but I don't recall any hosting.

-one of the couple is. White long hair cold boss and golden retriever/mischievous short hair worker. They wore those stereotypical barista outfits–black vests, white button up and dress pants.

-Artstyle was really manga like and I recalled that the lineart and shading is brown but I could be wrong. 

-It was an unfeatured comic on webtoon. 

-for the voice dub, if I'm not mistaken, their voices are all male and it's like those British voices. Reference: Sebastian black Butler.

(I've tried everything 😭. Searching on Google, YouTube and webtoon itself.)

1o8rxpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1o8rxpu/built_a_free_tool_to_autogenerate_veo_3_scripts/,🎬 Built a Free Tool to Auto-Generate Veo 3 Scripts (Dialogues + Visual Prompts + Scene Breakdown),"Hey folks 👋, I just released a small **free tool** that helps creators **instantly format and optimize their Veo 3 scripts** for cinematic video generation.

If you’ve been manually breaking dialogues or guessing the character limits — this tool basically automates that entire process.

https://preview.redd.it/yash1y8unlvf1.jpg?width=1900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ec8450b9cb5798c9739ad789298c3fe4be61aa54

Here’s how it works 👇

# 🧠 1. Prepare Your Script

Start with any script that includes action + dialogue.  
It works best when your dialogues are clearly marked with `""quotes""` or words like *says*, *replies*, etc.

**Example:**

    John walks into the coffee shop, looking around nervously.
    John says ""I need to talk to you about something important.""
    Sarah closes her laptop slowly.
    Sarah replies ""What’s going on? You look worried.""

💡 *Pro Tip:* Clear dialogue indicators = perfect detection.

# ⚙️ 2. Input Your Script

Paste it into the tool’s text box and it will:

* Detect all dialogue lines in real-time
* Automatically comply with Veo 3’s **95-character dialogue limit**
* Support up to **15,000 characters** and **38 dialogue scenes**

# 🎨 3. Configure (Optional)

You can tweak:

* **Transition Style** → smooth cuts / fades / dynamic movements
* **Character Consistency** → add detailed character looks
* **Environment Details** → lighting, time of day, setting

# 🚀 4. Generate Script

Click *Generate Script* and it will:

* Structure your scenes
* Create cinematic visual prompts
* Keep character design consistent
* Optimize dialogue for Veo 3’s scene timing

⏱ Usually takes 10–30 seconds to finish.

# 📤 5. Export & Use

You can:

* **Copy All** scenes
* **Copy Only Dialogues** for voiceover
* **Download** as a text file
* **Share** your results

# 💡 Pro Tips

* Use “says/replies” or quotes for dialogue detection
* Add character details for visual consistency
* Choose a visual style (cinematic / documentary / vintage etc.)
* Keep scenes 6–12s depending on dialogue length

# 🧩 Troubleshooting

* **No dialogues detected?** → Add “says” or quotes
* **Too many scenes?** → Limit to 38 per script
* **Slow generation?** → Wait 30s or split long scripts
* **Cut-off dialogue?** → Auto-split happens after 95 characters

If you’re building Veo 3 videos, this makes scripting *way smoother* — especially for POV, cinematic, or voiceover-based projects.

1o8rwrt,https://i.redd.it/mhxzml6unlvf1.jpeg,Must-Visit Cafes in Kuala Lumpur — My Top 3 Picks That Stole My Heart!,"Lately, I’ve been going on little weekend café adventures around Kuala Lumpur — and honestly, it’s been one of my favourite parts of living here. There’s just something about Malaysia’s café scene that feels so warm and creative at the same time 

Here are 3 cafes that really stole my heart:

Grumpy Bagels – The bagels here are sooo good. Crispy outside, chewy inside — just like the ones I used to get in Seoul, but with a local twist. Perfect spot for a lazy Sunday morning or to chill with friends.

Kopenhagen Coffee – I love that you can customise your own breakfast or brunch plate here! The vibe is clean, minimal, very Scandinavian — almost feels like a café in Seoul’s Hannam area. Their coffee is smooth and balanced too.

BASK. – If you love cheesecake, this is a must. Their Basque burnt cheesecake literally melts in your mouth — creamy, rich, but not too sweet. I’ve gone back more than once… maybe three times 😅

Every café has its own personality, but what I really love about KL’s cafés is how they mix local energy with international style. It’s such a nice blend.

Do you have any café recommendations I should try next? I’m building my KL café map one latte at a time ㅎㅎ

1o8rw0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/comments/1o8rw0k/part_2_the_pariah_by_charles_bowden_esquire/,"PART 2 The Pariah by Charles Bowden /Esquire magazine, September 1998/ Interview with LA DEA Supervisor Mike Holms and Hector Berrellez (KIKI Camarena Murder Investigation Operation Leyenda) A secret agreement was found in 1995 by Gary Webb allowing government agents to smuggle drugs into USA","\-Part 2

For six weeks after his series came out, Webb waited in a kind of honeymoon. His e-mail was exploding, he recalls, ""from ordinary people who said, 'This has restored my faith in newspapers.' It was from college students, housewives that heard me on the radio; it was really remarkable to think that journalism could have this kind of effect on people, that people were out marching in the streets because of something that had been hidden from us all these years. The thing that surprised me was that there was no response from the press, from the government. It was total silence.""

 

Finally, in early October, The Washington Post ran a story by Robert Suro and Walter Pincus headlined, THE CIA AND CRACK: EVIDENCE IS LACKING OF ALLEGED PLOT. The story focused in part on the fact that Webb had given a defense attorney questions to ask Oscar Danilo Blandon about his CIA connections. It also quoted experts who denied that the crack epidemic originated in Los Angeles, disputed that Freeway Rick Ross and Blandon were significant national players in the cocaine trade of the eighties (pegging Blandon's coke business at five tons over the decade, whereas Webb had evidence that it was more like two to five tons per year). And, the article continued, there was no evidence that the black community had been deliberately targeted (the ""plot"" referred to in the headline and a claim never made by Webb), that the CIA knew about Blandon's drug deals (also a claim never made by Webb, who in the series merely connected Blandon to CIA agents), or that Blandon had ever kicked in more than $60,000 to the contra cause (the Post based this number on unnamed law-enforcement officials;

Webb based his estimate of millions of dollars to the contras from dope sales on grand-jury testimony and court documents). Perhaps the best summary of the Post's retort to Webb came from the paper's own ombudsman, Geneva Overholser, some weeks later: ""The Post...showed more passion for sniffing out the flaws in San Jose's answer than for sniffing out a better answer themselves. They were stronger on how much less money was contributed to the contras by the Mercury News's villains that their series claimed, how much less cocaine was introduced into L.A., than on how significant it is that any of these assertions are true.""

 

In late October, the Los Angeles Times and The New York Times weighed in on consecutive days. The Los Angeles Times had two years before described Freeway Rick Ross vividly: ""If there was an eye to the storm, if there was a criminal mastermind behind crack's decade-long reign, if there was one outlaw capitalist most responsible for flooding Los Angeles's streets with mass-marketed cocaine, his name was Freeway Rick....Ross did more than anyone else to democratize it, boosting volume, slashing prices, and spreading disease on a scale never

before conceived....While most other dealers toiled at the bottom rungs of the market, his coast-to-coast conglomerate was selling more than five hundred thousand rocks a day, a staggering turnover that put the drug within reach of anyone with a few dollars."" In the 1996 response to Webb's series, the Los Angeles Times described Ross as one of many ""interchangeable characters"" and stated, ""How the crack epidemic reached that extreme, on some level, had nothing to do with Ross."" Both stories were written by the same reporter, Jesse Katz, and the 1996 story failed to mention his earlier characterization. The long New York Times piece the following day quoted unnamed government officials, CIA personnel, drug agents, and contras, and noted that ""officials said the CIA had no record of Mr. Blandon before he appeared as a central figure in the series in the Mercury News.""

 

A common chord rang through the responses of all three papers: It never really happened, and if it did happen, it was on a small scale, and anyway it was old news, because both the Kerry report and a few wire stories in the eighties had touched on the contra-cocaine connection. What is missing from the press responses, despite their length, is a sense that anyone spent as much energy investigating Webb's case as attempting to refute it. The ""Dark Alliance"" series was passionate, not clinical. The headlines were tabloid, not restrained. But whatever sins were committed in the presentation of the series, they cannot honestly be used to dismiss its content. It is puzzling that The New York Times felt it could discredit the story by quoting anonymous intelligence officials (a tack hardly followed in publishing the Pentagon Papers). In contrast, what is striking in Webb's series is the copius citation of documents. (In the Mercury News's Web-site [version-cgi.sjmercury.com/drugs/postscriptfeatures.htm](http://version-cgi.sjmercury.com/drugs/postscriptfeatures.htm) \-- are the hyperlinked facsimiles of documents that tug one into the dark world of drugs and agents.) But when Jerry Ceppos, the executive editor of the Mercury News, wrote a letter in response to the Post's knockdown, the paper refused to print it because a defense of Webb's work would have resulted in spreading more ""misinformation.""

 

Despite Ceppos's initial defense of the series, the Mercury News seemed to choke on these attacks, and Webb could sense a sea change, But he kept on working, building a a bigger base of facts, following its implications deeper into the government. When the Mercury News forced him to choose between a $600,000 movie offer and book deals and staying on the story, Webb picked the story\*\*.\*\* He kept discovering people who had flown suitcases full of money to Miami from dope sales for the contras. He documented Blandon's contra dope sales from '82 through '86. Gary Webb was on a tear; he was going to advance the story. Almost none of this was published by the Mercury News; the paper grudgingly ran (and buried) one last story on New Year's Eve 1996.

 

The paper had printed the story of the decade, the one with Pulitzer prize written all over it, and now was unmistakably backing off it. Webb entered a kind of Orwellian world where no one said anything, but there was this thing in the air. The Mercury News assigned one of its own reporters to review the series, using the stories of the L.A. Times, The New York Times, and The Washington Post as the benchmark for what was fact.

 

Webb wouldn't admit it to himself, but he had become a dead man walking.

 

WHEN HECTOR BERRELLEZ SPENT HIS YEAR GOING TO MOVIES IN Washington, he knew he was finished in the DEA. One day in October 1996, a month after he retired, Hector Berrellez picked up a newspaper and read this big story about a guy named Gary Webb. Hector had lived in shadows, and talking to reporters had not been his style. ""As I read, I thought\*\*, This shit is true\*\*,"" he says now. He hadn't a doubt about what Webb was saying. He saw the reporter as doomed. Webb hit a sensitive area, and for it he would be attacked and disbelieved.

Hector knew all about the Big Dog and the Big Boy rules.

[https://medium.com/matter/blood-on-the-corn-52ac13f7e643](https://medium.com/matter/blood-on-the-corn-52ac13f7e643)

Hector's body aches from the weight of secrets. When we meet, he is in a white sport shirt, slacks, a blue blazer with brass buttons, and a shoulder-holstered 9mm with fifteen rounds in the clip and two more clips strapped under his right arm. He may be a little over-armed for his Los Angeles private-investigation agency (the Mayo Group, which handles the woes of figures in the entertainment industry -- that pesky stalker, that missing money -- for a fat fee up front and two hundred dollars an hour), but not for his history. For the rest of his life, Hector Berrellez will be sitting in nice hotels like this one with a cup of coffee in his hand, a 9mm under his jacket, and very quick eyes.

 

He saw a lot of things and remembers almost all of them. He wrote volumes of reports. **In 1997, he was interviewed by Justice Department officials about those unseemly drug ledgers and contra materials he saw during the raid on the fourteen Blandon stash houses back in 1986.  His interviewers wanted particularly to know whether anyone besides Hector had seen them. They then told Hector that they couldn't find the seized material anymore.**

 

Before he retired, Hector was summoned to Washington to brief Attorney General Janet Reno on Mexican corruption. He talked to her at length about how the very officials she was dealing with in Mexico had direct links to drug cartels. He remembers that she asked very few questions. Now he sits in the nice lounge of the nice hotel, and he believes the CIA is in the dope business; he believes the agency ran camps in Mexico for the contras, with big planes flying in and out full of dope. He now knows in his bones what the hell he really saw on October 27, 1986, when he hit the door of that house in the Los Angeles area and was greeted with politeness and fresh coffee.

 

But he doesn't carry a smoking gun around. The photos, the ledgers, all the stuff the cops found that morning as they hit fourteen stash houses where all the occupants seemed to be expecting company, all that material went to Washington and seems to have vanished. **All those reports he wrote for years while in Mexico and then later running the Camarena case, those detailed reports of how he kept stumbling into dope deals done by CIA assets, never produced any results or even a substantive response**.

 

Hector Berrellez is a kind of freak. He is decorated; he is an official hero with a smiling Ed Meese standing next to him in an official White House photograph. He pulled twenty-four years and retired with honors. He is, at least for the moment, neither discredited nor smeared. Probably because until this moment, **he's kept silent.**

 

And Hector Berrellez thinks that if the blacks and the browns and the poor whites who are zombies on dope ever get a drift of what he found out, well, there is going to be blood in the streets, he figures -- there is going to be hell to pay.  He tells me a story that kind of sums up the place he finally landed in, the place that Gary Webb finally landed in. The place where you wonder if you are kind of nuts, since no one else seems to think anything is wrong. An agent he knows was deep in therapy, kind of cracking up from the undercover life. And the agent's shrink decided the guy was delusional, was living in some nutcase world of weird fantasies. So the doctor talked to Hector about his patient, about whether all the bullshit this guy was claiming was true, about dead men and women and children, strange crap like that. And he made a list of his patient's delusions, and he ticked them off to Hector. And Hector listened to them one by one and said, ""Oh, that one, that's true. This one, yeah, that happened also."" It went on like that. And finally, Hector could tell the shrink wondered just who was nuts -- Hector, his patient, or himself.

 

ON SUNDAY, MAY 11, 1997, GARY WEBB WAS hanging wallpaper in his kitchen when the San Jose Mercury News published a column by executive editor Jerry Ceppos that was widely read as a repudiation of Webb's series. It was an odd composition that retracted nothing but apologized for everything. Ceppos wrote, ""Although the members of the drug ring met with contra leaders paid by the CIA and Webb believes the relationship was a tight one, I feel we did not have proof that top CIA officials knew of the relationship."" Fair enough, except that Webb never wrote that top CIA officials knew of the contra-cocaine connection. The national press wrote front-page stories saying that the San Jose Mercury News was backing off its notorious series about crack. The world had been restored to its proper order. Webb fell silent. He had to deal with his own nature. He is not good at being polite. ""I'm just fucking stubborn,"" he says, ""and that's all there was to it, because I knew this was a good story, and I knew it wasn't over yet, and I really had no idea of what else to do. What else was I going to do?""

 

What he did was have the Newspaper Guild represent him in arbitration with the Mercury News over the decision to ship him to the wasteland of Cupertino. ""I'm going to go through arbitration, and I'm going to win the arbitration, and I'm going to go to work,"" he says. ""I was just going to fight it out. This was what I did, this was me, I was a reporter. This was a calling; it was not something you do eight to five. People were not exactly

beating down my door, saying, Well, okay, come work for us. I was...unreliable."" So he went to Cupertino, and he wrote stories about constipated horses and refused to let his byline be printed. And then he went to his

apartment and missed his wife and family and watched Caddyshack endlessly. He was a creature living a ghostly life. The only thing he didn't figure on was himself. Webb slid into depression. Every week, the 150-mile drive between his family in Sacramento and his job in Cupertino became harder. Every day, it was harder to get out of bed and go to work.

 

And he was very angry most of the time. He says, ""I was going to live in my own house and see my own kids. At some point, I figured something was going to give."" Finally, he couldn't make it to work and took vacation time. When that was used up in early August, he started calling in sick. After that, he went on medical leave. A doctor examined him and said, ""You are under a great deal of stress,"" and diagnosed him as having severe depression. He couldn't sleep. He couldn't do much of anything. He decided to write a book about ""Dark Alliance,"" but this time no one wanted it. His agent was turned down by twenty-five publishers before finding a small press, Seven Stories, that operates as a kind of New York court of last resort.

 

A job offer came from the California state legislature to conduct investigations for the government-oversight committee at about the same money he made for the Mercury News. His wife said, Take the job. Why hang around in this limbo? Webb thought about her words and told himself, What do I win even if I do win in arbitration? I get to go back to my office and get bullshitted the rest of my life. He watered his lawn, worked on the house, read more and more contra stuff. Drifted in a sea of depression. ""I didn't know what to do if I couldn't be a reporter,"" he says. ""So all of a sudden, I was standing there on the edge of the cliff, and I don't have what I was doing for the last twenty years -- I don't have that to do anymore. I felt it was like I was neutered. I called up the Guild and said, 'Let's see if they want to settle this case.' They sent me a letter of resignation that I had to sign.""

 

Webb carried the letter with him from November 19 to December 10 of last year. Every day, he got up to sign the letter and mail it. Every night, he went to bed with the letter unsigned. His wife would ask, Have you signed it? Somebody from the Mercury kept calling the Guild and asking, Has he signed it yet?  ""I mean,"" he says softly, ""writing my name on that thing meant the end of my career. I saw it as a sort of surrender. It was like signing,"" and here he hesitates for several seconds, ""my death certificate.""

 

But finally he signed, and now he is functionally banned from the business. He's the guy nobody wants, the one who fucked up, the one who said bad things. Officially, he is dead, the guy who wrote the discredited series, the one who questioned the moral authority of the United States government.

 

If Gary Webb could have talked to a Hector Berrellez in the fall of 1996, when his stories were being erased by the media, Hector would have been like a savior to him. ""Because he would have shown what I was reporting was not an aberration,"" Webb says now, ""that this was part of a pattern of CIA involvement with drugs. And he would have been believed."" But Webb was not that lucky, and the Hectors of the world were not that ready to talk then. So Webb was left out there alone, one guy with a bunch of interviews and documents. One guy who answered a question no one wanted asked.

 

I CAN HEAR HECTOR BERRELLEZ TELLING ME that I will never find a smoking gun. I can hear the critics of Gary Webb explaining that all he has is circumstantial evidence. Like anyone who dips into the world of the CIA, I find myself questioning the plain facts I read and asking myself, Does this really mean what I think it means?

 

**-- In 1982, the head of the CIA got a special exemption from the federal requirement to report dealings with drug traffickers. Why did the CIA need such an exemption?**

\-- Courthouse documents attest to the fact that the Blandon drug organization moved tons of dope for years with impunity, shipped millions to be laundered in Florida, and then bought arms for the contras. Why are Gary Webb's detractors not looking at these documents and others instead of bashing Webb over the head?

 

\-- The internal CIA report of contra cocaine activity has never been released. The Justice Department investigation of Webb's charges has never been released. The CIA has released a censored report on only one volume of Webb's charges. The contra war is over, yet this material is kept secret. Why aren't the major newspapers filing Freedom of Information \[Act\] requests for these studies?

 

\-- The fifty-year history of CIA involvement with heroin traffickers and other drug connections is restricted to academic studies and fringe publications. Those journalists who find themselves covering the war on drugs should read Alfred McCoy's massive study, The Politics of Heroin: CIA Complicity in the Global Drug Trade, or Peter Dale Scott and Jonathan Marshall's Cocaine Politics: Drugs, Armies, and the CIA in Central America.

 

\-- Following the release of ""Dark Alliance,"" Senator John Kerry told The Washington Post, ""There is no question in my mind that people affiliated with, on the payroll of, and carrying the credentials of, the CIA were involved in drug trafficking while involved in support of the contras."" Why has the massive Kerry report been ignored to this day?

 

\-- On March 16, 1998, the CIA inspector general, Frederick P. Hitz, testified before the House Intelligence Committee. ""Let me be frank,"" he said. ""There are instances where CIA did not, in an expeditious or consistent fashion, cut off relationships with individuals supporting the contra program who were alleged to have engaged in drug-trafficking activity, or take action to resolve the allegations.""

 

**Representative Norman Dicks of Washington then asked, ""Did any of these allegations involve trafficking in the United States?""**

 

**""Yes,"" Hitz answered.**

 

The question is why a mountain of evidence about the CIA and drugs is ignored and why the legitimate field of inquiry opened by Webb remains unpursued and has become journalistic taboo.

 

Maybe the CIA is great for America. But if it is, surely it can roll up its sleeves and show us its veins.

 

WEBB AND HIS WIFE, SUE, ARE STANDING IN the driveway with me after a Thai dinner in Sacramento. The night is fresh; spring is in the air. A frog croaks from the backyard on the quiet and safe suburban street. Sue has just finished rattling off details from one facet of the contra war, the CIA drug-airline operation run out of Ilopango airfield in El Salvador. She seems to have absorbed a library of material over the last three years of her husband's obsession. Before, he always worked like hell, she knows, but on this one he brought it home. He could not keep it separated from his wife and family and his weekly hockey games. So Sue, with her winning smile and cheerful ways, has become an authority on America's dark pages. And we stand there in the fine evening air, the rush of spring surging through the trees and grass and shrubs, talking about the endless details of this buried episode in the secret history.

 

And I wonder how Webb deals with it, with all the hard work done, with all the facts and documents devoured, and with all this diligent toil resulting in his personal ruin, depriving him of the only kind of work he has ever wanted in his life.

 

And I remember what he said earlier that day while he sat in his study, leaning toward me, his right hand gripping his left wrist: ""The trail is littered with bodies. You go down the last ten years, and there is a skeleton here and a skeleton there of somebody that found out about it and wrote about it. I thought that this is the truth, and what can they do to you if you tell the truth? What can they do to you if you write the truth?""

I brewed a cup yesterday afternoon and sat out on my porch with it. I must say, it was quite nice. It didn’t hit me in the chest like coffee does, and I felt a bit more relaxed afterward. The flavor was lighter than I expected, not bad; just different.

I suppose I’m wondering what kinds of tea you all might recommend for someone like me, who’s used to strong, black coffee but wants something easier on the nerves. Are there any brands or blends that are particularly comforting or smooth? I’m in no rush, just enjoying trying something new at my age.

I’ve been doing IF since March 1 when I went off Ozempic d/t SE and cost.  I take Metformin, Chromium and occasionally Berberine 200 mg dly.  I lost 15 pounds and finally under 200.  I’m 66 ( also a back issue)and try hard to exercise… fit class when I can and walking.  This summer I did water aerobics.  Now IF isn’t working well.  I tried to add protein as I felt with 2 meals a day ( meat and veggies or salad) plus snacks that I needed more protein.  My snacks are nuts, meat sticks, some cheese.  I do have a small dark chocolate after meals.  With adding the protein I’ve gained 6 pounds.  Now I must admit I do a little half and half in my morning coffee.  Any tips for me to jump start and not go back wards?",2,1760674877.0,intermittentfasting,5,1.0,False

Mila, if I could take those words back, I would.

If you are reading this, I will already be gone. They took my little sister when I was young. I'm next.

We grew up in an apartment downtown. It was just us three—me, Mila, and Mom.

Mila used to follow me everywhere I went. She played with *my* toys, and repeated *my* jokes. She couldn't be escaped; we went to the same school. Mila thought *my* friends were *hers*. I said no. She'd throw a fit and cry. She was a leech I couldn't pry off. When school ended, I couldn't run home faster. I'd leave her behind; sometimes she'd get lost on her way home.

If only I knew then what I know now.

They tried to make me think I was crazy.

But my sister was *real.* I remember her yellow hair, bruised elbows and knees, and the pink sweater that went past her fingers. Mila liked to please others, especially mom and whatever boyfriend she had at the time. 

I don't remember his name. He'd drink wine with mom, lots, then they'd laugh as Mila showed them drawings. I always watched, wondering when it'd be my turn. I wasn't jealous, it's just—nobody cared about me. Not like they did Mila. Maybe it's because boys are supposed to be big and quiet, like her boyfriend. I tried to protect her. I really did.

She wanted to share toys. We have to share *everything*, she said. I said no. A switch flipped and suddenly she was crying, a sound that rattled the walls of our dingy apartment. Soon Mom would come and take her side, like always.

""I wish you never existed,"" I whispered, before Mom came and dealt my punishment. She was nothing but trouble.

It's funny—I hated Mila, but I didn't want her to get hurt. I locked the doors at night when mom was too drunk. That was the only time she ever praised me. When I laid in bed at night, I stared at the bottom of Mila's bunk and waited. I couldn't sleep until I heard her breathing get slow. It was the only way to know for sure.

The faceless man came when I was awake.

I knew he'd come.

It stood and watched me. Its blank face tilted to the side. Skinny black limbs began to move and twist like snapping branches.

Its body stretched up, elastic, as it leaned into the bunkbed. Pushed our beds with its weight, but it didn't make a sound. It was big and quiet.

I couldn't move. I stared at her bunk and waited until the sounds stopped. I'm supposed to protect her. 

I don't remember when it left. 

I waited for the sound of her breathing, then I could sleep too. Maybe she'd forget about it in the morning.

""*Hey*,"" she whispered in my ear. I roll onto one side.

She hung upside down from the top bunk, her long yellow hair streaming down like a curtain. There was no face; there was nothing to look at. Her arms, bare without the pink sweater, hung in bruised, sharp angles. 

She didn't speak again.

I pull the covers over my head and wait until morning. 

The next morning, I saw a blank ceiling above my head. Her top bunk was gone. No pillows, no blankets—nothing. I hid under the covers and pretended to be asleep, hoping she'd be here when I woke up. But then Mom shook my shoulder, telling me to get dressed and ready for school.

As I sat down for breakfast, Mom sipped her coffee without greeting me. I ate my eggs with little appetite. Mom's little spark of joy was gone, and without her, the house was eerily quiet.

""Where's my sister?"" I asked between mouthfuls.

Mom rolled her eyes, and before answering, she poured liquor in her coffee. In that thick, dry voice, she drawled—

""You don't have one.""

They were wrong. She did exist. And now he’s coming for me.",1,1760674858.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
