Back in August, my ex-girlfriend (23) and I (23) broke up, and I’ve been struggling to process everything. It felt like it came out of nowhere because, in my mind, we were solid. But during the breakup, she gave me multiple reasons: needing to focus on her career, saying the relationship didn’t work for her anymore, and that forever didn’t make sense as a scientist.

The hardest part? She also told me she had feelings for two other people. One was a guy she’s close with, and the other is a girl she’s been friends with. She said they had amazing chemistry, and she even went on cute car dates with one of them before we officially broke up. I felt blindsided.

The breakup dragged on for over four days, and she listed all of my problems and blamed me for not being there for her because I moved abroad for my PhD. She also criticized my family and even made it seem like it’s normal for friends to help each other find ""replacements."" One of the most painful moments was when she asked me to choke her during a vulnerable moment in the breakup—it was emotionally heavy.

After the breakup, I took two weeks to process everything and realized I had lost myself in the relationship. I had started adopting her fears, insecurities, and anxieties, and deep down, I was drained. Despite that, I still loved her and hoped we could fix things. So, I reached out to meet her in person.

When we met, I told her how hurt I was that she had emotionally checked out and prepared to move on with these other people. She was cold and distant, saying she wasn’t in love with me anymore and wanted to move on. I mentioned my own crushes and the times I had thought about breaking up with her, and she accused me of being dishonest, saying I had destroyed her trust. She also said we could still be friends, but only to grab a coffee and nothing more.

It’s been three weeks since I last reached out. I’ve been trying to distance myself, but I still check messaging apps and see she’s online, likely talking to the people she’s interested in. I feel like she’s already moved on while I’m stuck in the past, feeling like I lost someone I deeply cared for.

I’m confused. Part of me wants to reach out to her on her birthday in November, but I don’t know if it’s worth it. Should I message her and try to reconnect? Or should I just accept that she’s moved on and there’s no going back? I’m also scared she’ll rewrite our history and forget the good we had.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Is there any hope of rebuilding a friendship or reconnecting in the future, or should I just let go and move on?",2,1728043820.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I know I’m not soft-spoken, but I’m never mean or disrespectful. When I’m upset or feel disrespected, my tone can come off as aggressive, but that’s how I express myself. I also come from a very close family and we often make efforts to celebrate holidays together or have family dinners often. Family is important to me and my husband.

My MIL, on the other hand, is very sensitive and often plays the victim when we mention things we don’t like or understand. She’ll say she’s not used to being “confronted” and that she’s hurt, even over very basic conversations. It’s hard for me because I’m not used to that kind of response.

We have a 2-year-old daughter, and my MIL has watched her before, but this time, she wanted to have her over for a sleepover. We’ve always been close, and I considered her a friend. During this sleepover, she didn’t answer her phone for 4 hours, which worried my husband and me. She also put our daughter to bed 2 hours later than usual. When we expressed how concerned we were and how our boundaries had been disrespected, she made it about her, saying she was “having fun” and doesn’t like being on her phone. I got more upset and reminded her that she never trusted anyone to babysit her kids, so how would she feel in this situation?

Instead of addressing our concerns, she told me that I’m “always rude” and need to learn how to talk to her because our communication styles are different. This frustrated me because I’ve never been disrespectful, she just doesn’t like my direct tone, and it completely sidetracked the real issue.

Also, ever since she started dating after her divorce, she’s cut out a lot of her friends and only visits us when it’s convenient for her new BF. My husband and I have expressed this to her before (we used to be super close), but she always says these conversations hurt her, without ever considering how her actions affect others. She tends to make everything about her feelings. Keep in mind, we come from a small town where everyone is treated equally, including elders. No one is expected to act differently around anyone.

To make things worse, I found out my husband’s grandparents refuse to come to our house anymore because they didn’t like my tone when I offered them coffee once. I’m pregnant and emotional, and it feels like they’re talking behind my back because they don’t like my natural way of communicating.

I’ve always made an effort to involve my husband’s family in our lives, mixing our families for holidays, sharing daily pictures of our daughter, and adding them to group chats. Now I feel disrespected for just being myself.

[\\""It's a bubble! I mean... the oooooffffffiiiiiice...\\""](https://preview.redd.it/ub3iasmtcqsd1.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=f942341492de4eadf3c5370a89ef52da8292c05b)

We've had some exciting Fridays four out of the last five weeks in a row. With the same sort of bearish manipulation we saw approach our $2 jump on the Friday of September OPEX, could we see another type event catalyze during today's trading? Let's find out!

**Price Movement Recap**

Yesterday's trading - with the exception of an early bit of dynamism that bound itself to exactly one standard deviation (Σ) above and below VWAP, overall trading volume and volume in the options market was quite light with only 4.66mil shares traded and less than $6mil in premium traded on options. For reference, this was thus the lightest trading day we have seen since Wednesday, 8/27 or the date I drew my very first technical doodle projection.

[10\/3 Trading Day 1-min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/2oj7382d1qsd1.png?width=1263&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f4e8ed3befc59840c1ae5d7c306bb49fe1ee492)

What little premium was traded was modestly biased in favor of bearish trades, though with so little actual volume on the day, the slump effect was accordingly mild.

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

Again, even though the options premium imbalance was slanted to the bearish side, it was so light that our Max Pain strike into today's weekly expiry did not shift. We are still sitting pretty at $21.50. Despite our light volume over all, however, there were some strikes which stood out in terms of OI Changes:

[10\/4 OI Changes 10\/3-10\/4](https://preview.redd.it/h4rxflbi3qsd1.png?width=1867&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca5960717c6cb66bb4071259c5bf8f0664e6649f)

For this week's expiry, we saw some mild contraction on both sides of the chain outside of our trading range with new OI concentrated between $20 and $23 with $22 standing out as a salient strike on the Call side. While total volume on the day was about dead even in terms of bearish and bullish premium, it does look like one or more traders decided to open new positions at the ASK and MID just prior to small dip into the close:

[Good luck, brethren! May your legal tender be plentiful.](https://preview.redd.it/jan4nm7c4qsd1.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5cdfb42696d7a411a605a005e55b87ff0555864)

New OI has started to pick up a bit for 10/11 expiry, but it is still light overall. Perhaps - and perhaps not - it will pick up during today's trading. 10/18, even though it too was rather light on the volume, did feature some curious OI changes:

[10\/18 OPEX OI Changes 10\/3-10\/4](https://preview.redd.it/zyccuy8x4qsd1.png?width=1843&format=png&auto=webp&s=0675d558f97a97d5a9013b7fc3ce652714bf3c66)

The two strikes of note were $21 on the Call side and $18 on the Put Side. On the Put side, it looks like our Bear from yesterday (lol fuq u dude) may have cashed out his Put position on exactly the little dip we saw toward the latter half of the day. Weirdly, despite the large change in OI (over 4000 contracts sold to close), UW reports almost no detectable volume on this contract. The same goes for our contracts at $21. If these contracts were bought to close, as likely was the case for the puts, then one wonders if these traders viewed their opportunity to for profit in these cases - tracking with downside volatility - as tapped out in the time that remains to them.

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/6g2e4umu6qsd1.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=305586a9ebe0724d198fce6189549ba47e77565e

As we take a look at our gamma exposure chart for today's trading, the cause of our little dip before yesterday's close comes into focus. With those 2000 $21 10/18 Calls closed, $21 negatized in terms of its gamma hedge pull. If MMs were short these calls (likely), then having them closed allowed them to unwind their shares hedges and pull the price down toward $21. Remember that all the OI with the nearest expiry exerts the highest proportional effect on MM gamma exposure, future expiries also have an effect on a given day's intraday hedging mechanics. 

Although this negative gamma position at $21 is still decently large, we still do not have sizable negative gamma accumulation in the $20.50-$20 range. Maybe this develops and gets built out into next week and 10/18 OPEX if we stay completely flat today. However, looking at today's gamma structure, it is not a foregone conclusion that we do.

Looking at today's structure I could see traders/institutions allowing the price to get pulled into $21 off the open, letting it lie flat for about an hour, and then somewhere between 11:30-1pm, once dealers have shed their long hedges for their short Call positions at $22, $22.50, and $23, an institution or retail whale comes in with a pile of cash and pops another gamma run all along the smooth-transitioning, net positive gamma strikes we have from $21.50 basically all the way up to $23.50. In this case, if we are able to trace down to $21, the high amount of negative net gamma at this strike might act as a slingshot like it did two weeks ago for 9/20 OPEX. Essentially, we'd a have a situation where traders would start selling puts to cash in on the downside volatility forcing dealers to close their short share hedges. This would create upward pressure from the negative gamma zone at the same time that it would build into hedging pressure from call-buying and spiking IV on price reversal to create another highly profitable gamma squeeze.

I will offer caution here, as we have had two gamma squeeze Fridays in a row and four in five weeks. If the right people are profiting, they might likely see little reason \*not\* to keep rinsing and repeating this tactic. However, its worthwhile to be wary of a fake-out despite the tantalizing possibility of another Friday Funday. 

**Technicals**

[7\/16-9\/19 1-Day Aggregation with Doodle Projection](https://preview.redd.it/3s6drtx6aqsd1.png?width=1485&format=png&auto=webp&s=d647223710f531217a3cd4c6505caa386ac4c091)

[7\/16-10\/3 1-Day Aggregation Actual](https://preview.redd.it/iookrffq7qsd1.png?width=1491&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e7ce69709e46fec316d0bdc09a2349684536045)

So, the real question for today's expiry is ""are the big boys going to come to play again or are they chilling until October OPEX?"" At this point, a $2 Friday gamma squeeze still does not jeopardize our technical paradigm (just as it did not last week or Monday) and might allow yet another cycle of call shorting into 10/18 OPEX as institutions play with options pricing algorithms on rapid IV wiggle. It still looks like, on the macrotrend, the price will continue to retrace to the $20.50-$21 area into October OPEX. However, it doesn't have to do so on a straight line to continue to adhere to high predictability scenarios.

**IV Trends**

https://preview.redd.it/qys61orgbqsd1.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&s=078aca84e612eb3f7582268df79c560e1aa6b188

My free AlphaQuery subscription has ended, so now it looks like this. Still gets the job done, but perhaps not as pretty. Fluctuations are pretty modest and synchronize with price action quite closely. Outside of a major upward volatility or news event, this will not change radically.

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

Volume from a major player will tell the story today. If institutions frame our early trading properly (slow, boring dip down to $21) and a Bullish Whale steps up to bat today, we do have potential for another gamma ramp event. However, with such events occurring now on 4 out of the last 5 Fridays, it'll be important to keep an eye out for the fake. We still look to continue our technical trend to stay between the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (transposed up by a dollar). However, a whale that comes in and try to ignite another $1-$2 gamma squeeze won't jeopardize the integrity of that trend.

Good luck out there!

Cheers

Thanks again to everyone else as well for making this an excellent spot to share information, discussion, and community as we all try to learn more about the market and GME! My thanks especially to everyone who has voiced support in the comments, reached out directly, or bought me coffees to fuel these regular writing sessions before market open!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I never hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.",6,1728043653.0,Superstonk,3,1.0,False

This town needs Gamblers Anonymous.

The first inkling I had of this dire need was the morning I called a friend to comfort her on the death of a relative.

“Yeah, yeah,” she muttered hurriedly. “Thanks a lot but I almost missed filling in my B-24 because of you.”

I looked at my watch. WDOR’s bingo game still had three minutes to go so I prudently waited a full half hour before placing my next call. This gal plays sixteen cards at a time and the strain is beginning to show.

“I’m not only getting crosseyed, I’m going color blind,” she sobbed. “This business of changing cards every week is driving me crazy. Just when I’m getting used to concentrating on shocking pink, I’m switched over to chartreuse or lavender.”

Not only that, she said, she’s so mad at the cards she’s getting she thinks she’s the victim of a conspiracy. A friend, who only plays with ONE card, has won three times in the past few weeks. My friend, who has yet to yell her first “Bingo” is getting so discouraged she’s tempted to quit and get a job.

The only thing holding her back is her fear of leaving the house. She’s scared stiff she’ll miss the station’s other hit program, the jolly jackpot call. People who listen carefully and have good memories can win whatever amount the jackpot holds. Providing, of course, they’re called.

“I don’t even bother with hellos anymore,” my friend confessed. “I just yell twenty-one-sixty-seven or thirty-three-ninety-five or whatever’s in jackpot and pray it’s a friendly announcer on the other end.”

She admitted the time she screamed ten-four, her amazed caller thought he was calling the county jail and hung up. “He’s the one spreading the rumor I’m getting flaky,” my friend said sadly. “He doesn’t know what terrible things can happen to people who sit home all day thinking of getting something for nothing.”

My friend really has changed. The day we met for coffee (before that day’s Bingo game began) she came in bleary-eyed, shoulders sagging, lugging a tote bag filled to the brim with little red cards. After greeting me with a mumbled “eight-ninety-eight” (it was too early for the jackpot to amount to much) she piled all her little cards on the counter and started punching them full of holes.

It was pathetic to watch. With each punch, I could hear her pray, “It’s gotta be a 985, please let it be a 985, all I need is a 985 and I can say goodbye to this crummy town forever.”

A 985, I learned from our sympathetic waitress, was the one number my friend needed to fill all four corners of her bingo card. If she came up with a precious 985 (the same number our waitress and the guys sitting around us needed) my bleary-eyed friend would be $2,000 richer.

Unfortunately. after messing up the counter with her discarded red circles, my friend was her usual broke self. There was no 985 in the heap nor was there any other number she could use.

That’s when she dipped into her tote bag for another intriguing game. This one is similar to bingo but with a difference. Playing card facsimiles are used instead of plain old numbers and my friend desperately needed either a King or Queen of Hearts to say goodbye to food stamps forever.

Alas, the royal pair proved as elusive as her badly needed 985.

1fvxewp,https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddittttttttt/comments/1fvxewp/tipping_culture_has_gotten_out_of_controlwhy_am_i/,Tipping Culture Has Gotten Out of Control—Why Am I Expected to Tip for EVERYTHING Now?,"Can we talk about how tipping has gone completely off the rails? I’m fine tipping at restaurants because I get that servers rely on those tips, but now we’re expected to tip for literally everything. Like, I order takeout and suddenly there’s a tip jar at the counter? Or I grab a coffee and the card reader’s flipping around with a 20% tip suggestion for someone who just handed me a cup? It’s getting ridiculous.

What really blows my mind is when I’m at places where the person barely does anything. I’ve had cashiers hand me a pre-bagged item I already paid for, and they’re expecting a tip! It’s almost like you’re guilt-tripped into it. I even saw someone mention tipping at self-checkouts. Are you kidding me? Where does it end? Are we going to start tipping for pumping our own gas too?

Look, I get wanting to support workers, but this has gotten out of control. If the job doesn’t involve actual service—like waiting tables or something—why are we being forced to throw extra money at it? It’s starting to feel like everyone wants a tip just for showing up. Enough is enough. If you’re just handing me something, I’m sorry, I’m not tipping for that.

1fvxelo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fvxelo,"I get a great kick out of meeting a nice or interesting car at the pumps, always a great place for a brief car chat. Here's what I saw in Bandon a few weeks ago","Mods - I have permission to show the plates from the owner so I will as it allows people to do a bit of research on the car if they want to. 

Years ago before I started attending car events and cars & coffee meetups the only way I could see and chat about interning cars was at the petrol station IF I was lucky enough to spot something interesting while I was there. Well a few weeks back I was filling up and in this 1984 Celica Supra came. It sounded peachy and is in mint condition so of course I had to go over for a look and a chat. The owner was only too delighted to chat about his pride and joy and how his ownership of it came about. It's not always the cars themselves that are impressive but often times the best part of the car is the story behind it! I won't go into the story behind this car but let me introduce the car in question to ye..

This is a 1984 Toyota Celica-Supra A60 (Gen 2). It's powered by an inline 6cyl 2.8L 12-valve DOHC engine producing 160bhp. In the 1980's these were very healthy performance figures and the handling of this car was also ahead of its time. The Celica Supra's four-wheel independent suspension was specially tuned and designed by Lotus and featured variable assisted power rack-and-pinion steering and MacPherson struts up front. At the rear, it had semi-trailing arm suspension with coil springs and a stabilizer bar.

This car marked a very clear indication that Toyota was taking aim at the greater sports coupe market after the success of the first gen Celica Supra taking on established sports cars like the Datsun 280z.

The A60 was also the last time we would see the Celica and Supra  in the same model as Toyota separated the two lines and made the Celica a front-wheel-drive platform and kept the rear-wheel-drive layout for the Supra line.

1fvx23r,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1fvx23r/creating_a_cozy_living_room_musthave_pieces_for/,Creating a Cozy Living Room: Must-Have Pieces for Warmth and Comfort,"Your living room is the heart of your home—a space where you unwind, entertain, and make lasting memories. Creating a cozy atmosphere is essential for making your living room inviting and comfortable. Whether you're starting from scratch or giving your space a refresh, these must-have pieces will help you achieve the perfect balance of warmth and comfort.

**1. Soft and Plush Sofas**

A sofa is the centerpiece of any living room, and the right one sets the tone for comfort. When choosing sofas in Dubai, opt for soft, plush fabrics like velvet or high-quality cotton to add warmth. Consider sectional sofas that offer plenty of seating space, or a cozy loveseat for a more intimate setting. Neutral tones such as beige, soft gray, or cream can enhance the room's warmth, while bold accent pillows or throws can add a splash of personality.

**2. Hanging Lights for a Soft Glow**

Lighting plays a crucial role in setting the mood. Instead of relying solely on harsh overhead lights, incorporate [hanging lights](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights) to create a soft, ambient glow. Pendant lights in warm tones like copper or bronze are perfect for casting a warm, welcoming glow over your space. Hang them strategically above your seating area or in a cozy reading nook to create focal points that radiate comfort. Dimmable hanging lights are also a great option for adjusting the ambiance to fit any mood, whether you're hosting a gathering or enjoying a quiet evening.

**3. Warm Rugs for Underfoot Comfort**

To make your living room cozier, don't overlook the importance of a well-placed rug. A plush area rug not only adds texture and warmth but also helps define the seating area, making it feel more intimate. Opt for thick, high-pile rugs in warm colors or patterns that match your decor. Pairing a rug with [modern furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) can create a visually striking contrast, blending contemporary style with a homey feel.

**4. Comfortable and Stylish Modern Furniture**

When creating a cozy living room, comfort doesn't mean sacrificing style. Modern furniture with sleek lines and minimalistic designs can still offer a warm, inviting feel when paired with the right accessories. Choose armchairs with soft cushions and a neutral palette, and balance them with a coffee table that ties the space together. Look for modern furniture pieces in natural materials like wood, leather, or rattan to enhance the organic warmth of your living room.

**5. Throws and Cushions for Layering**

Layering is key to making your living room feel cozy. A mix of soft throws and cushions adds a tactile element that invites you to sit back and relax. Choose throws in materials like wool, faux fur, or chunky knits, and scatter cushions in varying sizes and textures to create depth and interest. You can even mix and match colors and patterns to reflect your personality while still keeping the space unified.

**6. Ambient Table and Floor Lamps**

In addition to hanging lights, incorporating floor lamps and table lamps helps layer the lighting in your living room. Use lamps with soft, warm-toned bulbs to create an inviting atmosphere. Floor lamps can be placed next to sofas or armchairs to offer focused light, ideal for reading or relaxing. Meanwhile, smaller table lamps placed on side tables can provide gentle lighting throughout the room, making the space feel cozier during the evening.

**7. Natural Elements for Warmth**

Natural materials like wood, wool, and stone are fantastic for adding warmth and coziness to a living room. A wooden coffee table, rattan storage baskets, or woolen cushions bring in a touch of nature that feels comforting. Incorporating houseplants can also enhance the cozy vibe by adding a burst of greenery, which contrasts beautifully with modern furniture pieces.

**Final Thoughts**

Creating a cozy living room is all about layering warmth and comfort with thoughtful design elements. By carefully selecting [sofas in Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/sofas) that offer both comfort and style, adding ambient hanging lights, and mixing in the right modern furniture pieces, you can transform your space into a welcoming retreat. Remember, it’s the small touches like rugs, throws, and soft lighting that truly bring the coziness factor to life, making your living room a space where everyone wants to gather and relax. 

With these must-have pieces, you’ll be well on your way to designing a living room that feels as good as it looks.",1,1728041999.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

In the beginning I didn't want to, I wanted to stick to a more whole foods approach, but that didn't last.  Legumes and pulses were the obvious protein replacement, but I have IBS and can't tolerate canned beans for some reason, so I have to soak, then cook in a vented pressure pot, AND take two generic Beano tablets before every meal.  Then I found Field Roast seitan sausages, I liked the ingredient list, no weird chemicals like Beyond/Impossible/Morningstar, methylcellulose seems to really cause bad flare ups for me.  I also really like Yves ground round, and Silk cheese shreds.  I always read the ingredients and look them up before buying it.  I also have been eating a lot of So Delicious cashew based ice cream lately (going through a phase), but luckily I stopped eating chocolate and cut down on cakes/cookies.  I have a severe sugar addiction.    

100% of my meals are home made, I never eat take-out or go out and eat, I don't go out at all.  I eat a lot of vegetables and I eat gluten free pasta sometimes to balance out the seitan, and I only eat half a sausage now, I do have a slight sensitivity to too much gluten.  I eat mostly veggies, rice/pitas/pasta + plant based meat (cheese once in a while).  All super easy foods because I'm chronically ill, and I mostly eat one dinner type meal a day, instead of 3 meals, but with lot's of snacks and sugar in between, like gluten free waffles and toasts with cashew milk butter + maple syrup, and sweets. 

And I drink a TON of oat milk.  It used to be almond, but I switched to oat.  I go through like 8 cartons of it a week, zero sugar, half of it is processed and half of it is ""naked"" (just water+oats+salt+enzyme).  It used to be less, but now I'm drinking vegan protein powder (with less stevia than Vega) and cooking with it.  I've been drinking only plant based milk and water for the last 8 years, nothing else for beverages, I don't drink alcohol/juice/coffee/tea because I cannot tolerate it.  I've also started eating a lot of vegan icecream (from So Delicious Cashew), but I replaced chocolate/cakes/cookies with it, sort of.  Yeah I know it's unhealthy but that's how I ate before going vegan, so I don't feel like changing it.  I was just wondering if it's a bad idea to always eat plant based meat and cheese like that.  I used to eat lentil soup and chickpea curry that my mom made, but she hasn't made it in a while, but I always had to take beano.  Now I haven't touched my beano bottle in months, and I rarely get bloating.  ",1,1728041917.0,vegan,2,0.57,False

1fvwz26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1fvwz26/in_a_phantasmagoric_womans_prison_escaping_by/,"In a phantasmagoric woman's prison, escaping by mental willpower ","Just woke up and still processing coffee so the writing quality is going to suffer. Lol

I am a guy and last night I got sent to jail. I don't recall what crime I committed. As I entered, I realized it was much different from what I expected. It was dingy and grey, with lots of metal fixtures, uncomfortable furniture and very few people. No guards, or at least very few. It was more like some kind of abstract rehabilitation center but depressing.

So as I arrived I was searching for somewhere to claim. Each cot/cell was in an open concept, just behind a curtain on the sides of short hallways. At the end of the cot-room hallway was a door that led to another hallway, which led to an annex and a pool/hot tub area.

I am searching for a bedroom. As I do, I notice that women's swimwear is hanging from some of the curtains. I realize at this point that I am either in a woman's prison, or some kind of gender neutral space. But as I search for a bed to lay my things I just notice more and more drying bikinis and one-pieces so I surmise I must've been placed in a woman's prison. This is not particularly discomforting for me, I tend to prefer the presence of women in a platonic sense over guys anyways, but it is kind of a curiosity. Why am I here?

Anyways I can't find a room that has an unclaimed bed or a clean toilet so I go to the annex and ask an employee or guard type person if there are some other beds. She says yes, and takes me to a basically identical hallway with more of the curtain cell fixtures and has more swimwear hanging about, but one of them is finally empty. I set my things down and go to the pool.

There are two pools. One is a hot tub, which I enter, and one is a regular athletic rectangle pool which is empty. There are other prisoners in the hot tub, all women, most of them middle-aged or older, wearing leotard type swimgear. Above us is a catwalk.

We are warned that this is part of a walking trail for the outside world, and that cyclists frequent it. As they cycle, they overwork their bodies and produce vomit which then oozes through the vents in the jail. We begin to see them crossing the catwalk overhead. They are joyful, and deliberately avoid looking down at us. I am judging them.

Then the vomit comes. It seeps through the AC above. It is green like baby food, and I can smell it very acutely. It is sharp, horrible. I decide at this point that it is time for me to leave.

I see a friend in the courtyard. A male, finally. Someone I know in real life. He is behind a fence, I can see him. He is already leaving, behaving as if I am on that side of the fence with him now. So I try to will myself through the fence. I try to phase through it. My logic is if I believe hard enough that I am already on that side of the fence then I will be.

When I come to the realization about my line of thinking, it is clear that I am indeed already past the fence. I didn't phase through it magically or anything. I simply was ... just there. At this point the dream logic starts to fall apart and I piece some lucidity together. We are leaving the prison walking along a sidewalk in a residential area. Everything is clear, I can feel the wind on my skin and smell the trees, I feel my feet on the concrete, I am sweating, my breath rate is elevated, I can feel the clothes on my body. I remark, god, this is so realistic - it's just like real life. I am a little perturbed by this. If I am capable of dreaming such sharp and vivid clarity, how can I be sure that the waking life is ""real?""

At this realization I begin to physically struggle to continue to walk. I become out of breath. Then I wake.

It was very vivid and sharp but it wasn't very ""sober"" feeling. I have had much more conscious dreams that were equally as visually clear. This one was if I had just taken 5 shots of liquor.",1,1728041690.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

Goodness, it's been a while, hasn't it? Sorry to report that there hasn't been anything really worth writing a story about. Well, there was that one thing, but there might be legal action, so we'll just keep that quiet while it gets sorted. (Protip: lawyers read and search Reddit.)

Tonight gentle readers, we have a short tale the denizens of the shadows, oversized cutlery, and bravery. It is important to note that bravery isn't the act of being unafraid, but rather being afraid and still acting. Subtle nuance. 

Buttercup the Emotional Support Unicorn is over in her paddock by the coffee. Please note the assortment of festive fall ribbons should anyone wish to braid her mane.

Our story begins with your humble narrator relaxing in the back office, fighting to stay awake. It's been unseasonably hot here, with scorching summer heat ruining what should be a lovely fall, and as a result I haven't been able to sleep well. But at least it's a *dry* Satan's Buttcrack.

As I am contemplating the mysteries of the cosmos, I notice movement on one of the cameras. Ah. It would appear that one of the *locals* has settled in at our side entrance. Sitting down and rummaging in his backpack. Lovely. 

Best to roust him out before a guest goes out for a smoke or anything, so I put on a stern expression and head down the hallway. We have some lovely full-length glass doors on our side entrances, and so as I approach I can clearly see-

Oh my, that is a *very* large knife, isn't it?

I should note that the particular side door is locked and doesn't open from the outside, so I was never in any danger, but this has officially exceeded my paygrade. Doing a smooth about-face, I return to and lock the door of my little office sanctuary. Buttercup is unconcerned, and gives a derisive snort in a mock Australian accent. I then pop up the specific camera to see what the heck this guy is up to.

...shaving his ankle?

Apparently our new friend is using a large hunting knife to shave and scrape at his leg, occasionally dabbing away blood with an old shirt. This is weird, and not exactly criminal, but still very concerning. The last thing I need is for some guest to take a 3 am smoke break and meet this guy. So I call the local non-emergency line.

Apparently they heard the part about the large knife very clearly, as there are two police officers on the scene nigh-instantly. While I can't hear them, the body language implies a relaxed and casual approach - no guns or tasers out, and while they have him show his hands, after he puts down the knife they do have a nice chat before leaving.

I talk with the officer whose car is out front, ""Yeah, just a tweaker picking at scabs. Nothing bad."" I am relieved (mostly) ""Ah, okay.. wasn't sure if he was self-harming, having an episode, removing dead skin from an injury, or what. Is he going to be okay?"" ""Yeah, he's just high right now. He'll be leaving. Thanks for being worried about him.""

And with that, our new friend rode off into the darkness, with the officers departing a short time later. And thus did quiet return to the land.

Take a moment to say goodnight to Buttercup, and have a lovely, knife-free evening.

1fvwttn,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1fvwttn/tifu_by_writing_this_thread/,TIFU by writing this thread ,"
Everything started about a year ago when I got this remote job. It felt weird straight from the beginning. I applied because they offered a ""really good salary,"" and I had just finished my Bachelor’s in German Studies (Germanistik). I wasn't getting any good job offers—practically none, to be honest. My degree wasn’t as strong as I’d hoped, so I was desperate, trying anything.

They wanted me to send in a writing sample—just a simple text about an everyday problem. I wrote a half-page story about a woman who lost her dog in the woods, and a local forester found it a day later. Honestly, I thought it was boring. But the job description was basically, ""write creative and original stories that could go viral on social media."" I never thought I had a chance. I mean, if the job paid this well, thousands of people would apply, right? But to my surprise, I got an email with a link to an online meeting.

The job interview was…odd. They asked a lot of really personal questions, like who my last girlfriend was and even wanted to see my current bank account through some special app. They were always very kind, saying, ""If you're uncomfortable, it’s okay. But then the interview would end here."" Everything screamed SCAM at me, but they offered me 1,000€ just for submitting the sample, regardless of how the interview went. They transferred it straight to my account before we started talking. 

I was curious and desperate for money, so I said yes and amen to everything. 12,000€ a month? That’s CEO-level salary for writing stories like ""Linda, 46, lost her dog in the woods."" No brainer, right? They sent me a work laptop that looked like it was from the year 2000, with no branding whatsoever. I was only allowed to write on it—no notes on paper, no phones. The security guidelines were insane: I wasn’t allowed to talk about the job at all, and I received a detailed script about what to say if anyone asked about my work. I figured they were being overly cautious, but then…there were monthly checkups at my apartment.

I thought it was a joke. But every month, like clockwork, two guys with black suits and sunglasses even when it was cloudy, showed up at my door, going through my apartment, checking my phone, the Laptop and cloning my devices. By this point, I was sure I was working for the government or some secret organization but what for. But after the second visit, I just accepted it. I was getting paid an absurd amount of money to write nonsense stories. I was mostly on vacation, sitting by the pool in Tenerife or at a café in Paris, writing things like, ""My neighbor saved me without knowing,"" or ""A stranger on a train changed my life."" There was no specific story quota, and the work was so easy that I wrote three to four stories a day without breaking a sweat. No complaints, and the money kept rolling in. So did the monthly checkups.

When family asked what I was doing for work, I stuck to the script they gave me. “Freelance writer for a social media company.” I had two pages of instructions explaining what to say about my salary, my job, and two more pages detailing what I should never, ever mention.

Everything was fine—until I received an email that changed everything.

Normally, I received vague instructions like ""write about an environmentally friendly lifestyle"", ""a successful life story."" Or ""Technology is the solution"". But a few weeks ago, I accidentally got someone else’s story in my inbox. When we submit stories, our location is automatically added to the email signature. So I saw his location—he was in a café in Frankfurt. The same café I was passing by on my way to the airport.

I was supposed to fly to Barcelona, but in a moment of madness, I ditched my flight and went to that café. It took about half an hour to get there, and while I was sitting in the taxi, I thought, What the hell am I doing? This was definitely against my contract. What was I expecting to find?

When I arrived at the café, I saw a guy with the exact same laptop. Trying to act casual, I offered him a cup of coffee "" because I'm happy today"", and he agreed. As soon as I was back at his table, I went straight for it: ""I got the same laptop as you, and I want to know what we’re doing.""

He looked at me like I had just shot him. ""Sit the fuck down,"" he whispered. He was terrified. He kept looking around, checking if anyone was watching. But it wasn’t just fear; he just didn’t want to lose the money. This guy—let’s call him Sam—was in deep financial trouble, more than 650k in debt. His biggest worry wasn’t the secrecy; it was getting fired and losing his salary. He told me they’d cut his pay for three months and doubled his checkups to twice a month because he made the mistake of including personal details in one of his stories.

Sam and I were both ghostwriting for the same project it seemed, but his stories were worse. Unimaginative. He was a former salesman in his 40s, writing about things like a man losing his favorite sock or a teenage girl popping a pimple that got infected. Hundreds of stories. He told me he writes 100-150 of these a day. A day!

That’s when I started to question the whole operation. Why were we being paid so much for these pointless stories? So I started digging. I went to a public library, since I didn’t trust doing any research on my laptop, and you can go there use the computer for 50ct/1h. I began looking up my own stories, the ones I could remember. To my surprise, I found them everywhere—Twitter, Reddit, TikTok, Instagram. People were sharing them, acting as if they were their own experiences. Some of these accounts had millions of followers. My stories sometimes matched word for word, and yet nobody cared. Most of them barely got any attention.

Why would anyone go to all this trouble just for a ghostwriter?

The more I searched, the stranger it got. I started making notes of my stories and every week I’d check the library computers and find more of my stories online. Random Reddit accounts posted them in weird subreddits, and obscure Twitter accounts shared them with nearly zero followers. White noise. But then I noticed something—some of the stories had been slightly altered. Little tweaks. Products were inserted subtly. Like in Sam’s pimple story: a moisturizer was mentioned, and the character considered visiting the doctor.

The more I looked, the clearer the pattern became. In almost every story, a product was the solution: a bad day ""fixed"" with a good cup of coffee, a sleepless night made better by a high-quality mattress. No brands, just vague mentions of consumer goods. They were crafting stories that nudged people toward consumption, without them even realizing it. I thought this is all bullshit. I mean how inefficient is this right ? I dichted my theorys and burned the notes after I left the library. Accepting the reality that I'll get money for nonsense storys. 


A week after discovering ""the pattern"", the monthly checkup team came by. As they cloned my laptop, I noticed something strange: Sam’s email popped up on the screen  and the device they use for checking startet blinking red. The security guy looked at me and asked, ""Did you read that?""

""Sure,"" I said, trying to act dumb. ""I always read my instructions."" Then I looked again closer and added, ""Wait, no, that’s not my instructions. What’s that?""

He immediately closed the laptop and took it with him. His colleague was already on the phone. I tried to act angry, like they were messing with my paycheck, but inside, I was terrified noone was talking. And the college just put his hand on my shoulder signaling me to sit down on my sofa. After about 20 minutes sitting there, two more security guys showed up and handed me a new laptop. When they left, I could spot a logo on their second car I had to look it up it was: Boehringer Ingelheim.


That’s when it hit me. Boehringer Ingelheim. Do I work for one of the richest families in the world? They own everything—from pharmaceuticals to tech investments. This family is worth over 100 billion, and they’re so powerful, they sued manager magazine to avoid being ranked as the richest.

I opened the new laptop. A fresh set of instructions had already arrived. And that’s when my theory finally clicked: We’re not writing stories for social media. We’re creating a fake reality. Thousands of people like me are being paid to flood the internet with pointless stories that are laced with subtle consumption triggers. It keeps people thinking their mundane lives are normal while pushing them to buy products they don’t need, all controlled by a handful of the ultra-rich.

Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe this is all some crazy conspiracy. But I’ve seen enough to know I’m not imagining things. And after yesterday's checkup, I know they’re watching me.

TL;DR: I'm sitting in the same library right now, posting this as my last-ditch attempt to expose what’s going on. If they trace this back to me, this might be the last thing I ever write—for legal or physical reasons. Stay safe out there, don't consume to much.",0,1728041169.0,tifu,11,0.2,False

*September 22, 2024*

I (24F) live with my boyfriend (25M) in a two bedroom apartment in a major city, however, we have been fighting for almost a week because of a decision I made spitefully, and therefore, I may be TA. It's a small apartment, impossible to avoid him for much longer, so I really need a third party opinion on the matter.

For some background, we've been officially dating since we moved in together two years ago when I graduated from uni, but we were hooking up for about a year before then. During that year we weren't 'together', my bf (let's call him Sam) and his best friend (let's call him Max) were living together in this house. Max (27M) has been my bf's friend for years and is basically like an older brother to him. We've never really gotten along, but please believe me I have tried. It's just that Max never seems interested in getting to know me, or at worst gets genuinely annoyed by me interacting with him. Sam thinks it's probably the age difference (me being 24 and him being 27) that makes him not very interested in getting to know me - but I think that if he can get on with Sam despite the 2 year age gap then what's the problem with getting on with his girlfriend, age gap aside?

Anyway, it's besides the point, but I think pretty relevant for the actual argument. Basically, Max recently broke up with his girlfriend and since he was living with her she (rightfully) kicked him out. Now before you ask, no I have no idea why he thought that he would still have somewhere to live after telling his landlady with benefits that he wasn't sexually attracted to her anymore - but I digress. Now Max is homeless and has asked to stay with Sam. And yes, if you're wondering, I also live here and pay for rent and utilities (an equal amount to Sam), but I suppose Max only wanted to ask the person who's name is on the lease?

All this aside, Sam doesn't want Max to come and live with us again, which works for me because I wouldn't particularly like to live with a guy who doesn't deign to speak to me living here either. I think Sam doesn't want him living here because he used to be a bit of a slob when they lived together (his words not mine) but I would imagine he also doesn't want another person in a small apartment. However, Sam clearly lacks the spine to say any of this to his friend so who does he use as an excuse? Yeah. Me. Apparently he told Max how he would love for him to come and live with him again ('like in the good old days'), but his stupid girlfriend won't let it happen.

Now I could live with this if Max could act like an adult about it, but he's now started blowing up my phone with texts, calling me a bitch, calling me jealous, literally just random insults that don't even address the main issue (and before you ask, they're so specifically cruel that I am afraid if I copy and paste them in here that it will instantly become obvious who I am). I've shown them to Sam, but he told me just to ignore them and just do him a favour. He argued that since Max and I already don't like each other there's no harm in letting me take the fall for this decision.

This is where I might be the asshole, because on day 10 of receiving abusive messages from Max, instead of ignoring him or blocking him, I just told him the truth. It was late at night and I was tired and slightly tipsy from a bottle of wine, and Sam was out with Max, still enjoying his friendship despite the horrible things his friend was saying to his girlfriend. So yes, before you ask I was feeling vengeful and I think a lot of me did it out of spite. To be honest, the worst part is Max didn't believe me and if anything it only made him angrier at me. So in a way the only thing I succeeded at doing was breaking my promise to Sam not to tell him, simply because I let Max get in my head.
After I sent the message I got a call from Sam but ignored it, going to bed. When I woke up (I assume a couple of hours later) I had an angry boyfriend in my bedroom telling me that I was an asshole (not the word he used actually) and that Max didn't even believe me. I then asked him why it mattered so much, since Max didn't believe me, but I think he had had one too many drinks because he couldn't answer me and went to sleep on the couch.

It's been a week now and we've been giving each other the silent treatment. Max has come over for a couple of nights, sitting on the couch and watching football with Sam and giving me a similar stink eye but I've just left them to it and have moved into the guest room (partially to avoid Sam, partially to stop him from letting Max sleep here). So yeah, I'm typing this on day five of the cold war, from the guest bedroom, while my boyfriend is sleeping in our bed still angry at me for 'jeopardising his friendship'. AITAH?

TL;DR: BF lied to his best friend that I was the one who said he couldn't live in our apartment while he's homeless, best friend blew up my phone with nasty messages so I told him the truth and now BF is mad at me.

*September 23, 2024, 1 day later*

Well... for everyone who thought they might be sleeping together, you were right, I caught them fucking and sucking in our living room.

Just kidding, but that would probably be funnier than this update is going to be lol.

So... I'm still here, in the guest room, using Reddit as my only means of escape from my depressing reality, but for everyone who warned me that Sam would probably cave and let Max move in eventually...yeah he did and it only took one day since my previous post..

They are NOT sharing a bed (yet lol), Max has parked himself on our couch and shoved his stuff inside what used to be our bedroom. I was working from home this afternoon when the two of them started moving in, so I was able to grab everything and lock it in the guest room with me (barricade, actually). Sam texted me asking me to talk to them over dinner, probably about future living arrangements since it's clear what is inevitable here, but I just told him that I was coming down with a flu and should be avoided. Even though it's annoying having to talk so nicely to him, I still have to live here for two weeks more before I can escape, so I'm trying to act as normal as possible.

I'm really lucky that one of my friends is coming back from her work abroad in about two weeks, since her parents have arranged an apartment for her to move into and she's invited me to stay with her there until I can find somewhere else. It's been so difficult for me while she's been gone since she was basically my only friend in this city who wasn't also friends with Sam and Max. Speaking to her (even if it's the middle of the night where she is and she has no reception) has opened my eyes to how quickly I need to get out of both this relationship and this building. Girls out there, talk to your friends, they're seriously the biggest blessing you'll ever get.

So yeah if anyone has any advice to make these two weeks pass a little quicker, it would be appreciated. I think I'm still a devil-woman in both their eyes, and our mutual friends are somehow taking Sam's side. I don't know if he's spun them a different story, or it's just the fact that they were all his friends first, or even the fact that he's 'the baby of the group' (yeah... how did I not see that this was a red flag?), but at this point it doesn't even matter anymore.

Thank you to everyone who commented, showed interest and concern, etc. I didn't know how much I needed to speak to someone who wasn't friends with Sam. Hopefully my next update will be when I'm moved out but for now I'm safe and grateful.

*September 24, 2024, 2 days later*

Hello beautiful people of Reddit. The sun has just come out (metaphorically-speaking, I still live in the UK) and I've been inspired to write this mini-update to tell everyone all the petty things I have been doing while I wait for my best friend to come back from abroad so that we can move in together. For everyone wondering about it, I have amazing news, her parents have doubled down on helping me and are trying to speed up the apartment stuff so that there's a chance to start moving my stuff in even earlier - yippee!

As for the update, I thought I'd keep coming back to this post and adding to it every time I did something mildly petty. I know I said in my last post that I was going to live quietly so that Sam wouldn't kick me out, but some really amazing people messaged me to advise that I blackmail him into letting me stay until the end of the month by threatening to inform the landlord of Max's illegal tenancy :) How fun is that!

Without further ado, here is the list with the dates attached. Hopefully I'll keep coming back to it and editing it, and will try to credit the Reddit users who advised me :))

23rd/24th September 2024:

Had a lock installed on the guest bedroom (Thank you ab090424 and Parking_Ad_3123)
Put all the stuff I bought in the guest bedroom, such as the toaster, coffee machine, and all my plants (Thanks to Better-Turnover2783)
Called my male coworker over to install said lock (he's gay but Sam doesn't need to know that) and slightly dressed up while he was over (Thanks mommykraken for the inspiration)
Bought two packets of shrimp... iykyk (Thank you PrideofCapetown, Draigdwi, Minimum-Wishbone4218 and serjicalme)
Cleared a specific shelf for me in the fridge and the bathroom cabinet, started labelling all my things really passive-aggressively (Thank you Neat-Pen6522)
Have not bought glitter yet because I'm so accident prone I can't ensure that it won't get all over me first but trust when I say that there are plans in motion on this front (Thank you serjicalme and OldTadpole6050)
25th/26th September 2024:

When I left for work I kept my laptop open and playing Baby Shark over and over again (thanks for the inspo, zai4aj). It was annoying for the small amount of time I had to hear it leaving and then coming back and I had several missed calls and texts from Max asking me to please do something about it. Nothing from Sam, annoyingly, but I guess he has more of a quiet anger while Max is loud.
I baked. Still not so confident in my ability to cook steak (sorry Pristine-Payment and Puzzlehead-Bee4361) but I've always made a good lemon drizzle. I decided to use vanilla extract and white chocolate in the drizzle to make it smell better (was too sweet for me but everyone at worked liked it!). Reaction? Max asked if any was left, and I told him I had taken it into work since I wasn't fond of it. He laughed, but Sam quite literally glowered at me (which made me feel very smug).
I also decided to start grinding my coffee out in the kitchen (I moved it to my room after Reddit comments told me to take everything away) and I buy a really sweet and nutty blend so the smell is divine. I'm a bit worried with how amazing the apartment smelled today that I may have accidentally made the living situation a little nicer for them, but I think that it will start working really well once I leave, it'll make it more noticeable for them... like Pavlov's dog?
Sorry if there's anyone I forgot to thank, I'm totally swamped with comments and I'm trying my best to reply to all of them! I'll update more tomorrow if there's anything to say but feel free to comment more suggestions on petty revenge I can take as I begin moving out.
Thanks Reddit, promise I'll keep feeding you well!

EDIT: GUYS I MADE STIR FRY WITH THE SHRIMP OH MY GOD I'M NOT GOING TO USE THEM PLEASE STOP COMMENTING TELLING ME NOT TO USE THEM - I KNOW! I'M SORRY I THOUGHT IT WAS COMMON SENSE TO SEE THAT I WASN'T GOING TO CREATE AN ILLEGAL BIOHAZARD IN A PROPERTY OWNED BY AN INNOCENT LANDLORD.

Hello, I (24F) recently posted about a situation I've been in involving my bf and his best friend (link [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fnm30v/update_1_aita_for_telling_my_bfs_best_friend_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)) and it's finally gotten to the point where I'm moving out in a couple of weeks (can't move out and can't be kicked out - bit of a stalemate situation). 

I am coming on here at the suggestion of one of the comments, who said that you guys might know ways to fuck with them beyond leaving rotting shrimp in the curtain rods, cleaning the toilet with their toothbrushes, and putting glitter in their pockets? Any help would be appreciated since I'm holed up in the guest bedroom biding my time with nothing better to do than plot! :)) 

*[Editor's Note: Most people suggest food related things, like hiding shrimp or garlic, or put milk powder on their mattress]*

>#[Update 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fs3bch/update_2_aita_for_telling_my_bfs_best_friend_the/) 
*September 29, 2024, 7 days later*

I thought I'd give those asking an update on how Sam & Max are reacting to my antics (see my Mini-Update if confused). I'm sorry to say that even though many people recommended taking the petty route, it hasn't yielded much fruit, and if anything I just feel more childish for doing anything. Before all of that, though, I need to give a little more background so that everyone understands why this past week has been so odd.

So, Sam has always been a very conflict-avoidant person. I've never actually seen him get angry at anyone, or if he does he's more often just frustrated in the moment and then apologises. This is probably why in my first post I was almost convinced I was the AH, since he was genuinely quite upset with me which is something very rare in our relationship. I've always felt like we don't argue a lot because Sam was too forgiving (or...spineless?). I only realised that I still had the same mindset as my friends (That Sam was too forgiving and always a victim) when talking to my friend Daisy (24F, the one who is letting me move in with her <3). Regardless of all that, I've always felt slightly guilty because Sam is genuinely a very sweet person who isn't very good at getting angry or holding grudges or anything like that.
But then for a couple of days this past week he has felt like an entirely different person. I don't know if it's anger or resentment, or some secret third option, but he's been so quiet. I know I said in previous updates that he was acting civil, as though nothing had happened and that he was in denial about the breakup, but I think the denial stage has ended and the anger has begun. Today and yesterday he's gone back to acting normal, but I can't shake the weird feeling that I have - so I'm pretty sure that both our mental states are quickly degrading.

First and foremost, please nobody panic, I am safe. I have a lock on my door and a support network checking in with me every few hours. However, since everyone has known Sam for years, and like me, they've never seen him like this before, it's really difficult to figure out what to expect from him. If anyone needs examples of the strange behaviour, it's mainly just glaring at me whenever he sees me and stone-walling me - but I've also started to notice some of my things go missing. It could be from hastily moving them to my friend's parent's house, but a lot of them are sentimental items so it's hard not to point the finger at the embodiment of a dark cloud that's just looming around the apartment.
Idk why it's freaking me out so much but maybe because it feels like a switch has flipped suddenly. I also feel like I'm the one being weird, though, because isn't this what I wanted? I literally played Baby Shark on my laptop all day today while I was at work, and while Max called and texted me asking me to turn it off I heard nothing from Sam. It was also a male coworker of mine who installed the lock on my door, so yeah I haven't exactly been acting kindly. I almost feel like a schoolboy pulling on a girl's pigtails for attention right now, but I feel so unsettled to have no verbal reaction, so I feel like a bit of an idiot. Like of course he's going to be angry if I do all this petty stuff, what did I expect? I still don't feel unsafe but I think maybe my mental health has just hit a breaking point and I can no longer pretend that it all doesn't get to me.

It's weirder still that Max seems to agree with me about Sam's odd behaviour. Two people who have hated each other for years have suddenly been united somehow by the the one they care about, so maybe that's a bit of a silver lining. Today (after I came and turned off Baby Shark) Max knocked on my door and asked if anything else had happened with Sam. I told him no, and that the sudden change in his behaviour had nothing to do with me directly (just indirect pettiness....). He just sighed and asked when I was moving out, saying Sam was only going to get worse the longer I stayed, to which I told him that it was none of his business if I stayed forever. A bit childish of me, I know, but it's so annoying for Max to try and take on the mediator role since that's usually Sam.
He just sighed again and asked me not to play Baby Shark, that I shouldn't make him suffer for being in the middle of mine and Sam's issues - which I thought was very presumptuous of him considering how the fight started but whatever. I even started to feel, later on that night, very grateful that Max was here - purely because of how strange Sam was making me feel. So yeah, itching to get out and feeling not only guilty but frustrated that even if he's angered by my actions he still won't talk to me. Nothing I'm doing or feeling is rational, I know, but I feel like anyone who has been through a relationship break up after two years might empathise with me. If you're reading this and you have, any advise for how to get through not only losing your partner but feeling like you wasted a massive portion of your life on them?

Another thing to point out in my defence is that Sam was acting strange before the baby shark incident (I played it on my laptop in my locked bedroom while I went to work, so about 8 hours) and he wasn't even home when I had my coworker install the lock on my door (though maybe Max twisted that story?). Can I possibly believe that it was me baking lemon drizzle and not giving them any was his breaking point or did he just then suddenly realise it was over? Am I a bad person for feeling safe with Max? Please nobody comment any incel things like how my female hormones are telling me to side with the alpha male or anything like that, I'll seriously die from cringing. I just need some reassurance that given the circumstances the fact that me and Max are suddenly getting on a little better doesn't mean that I'm somehow betraying Sam (even though we're pretty much broken up), and that I have no obligation to check in with Sam about his behaviour.

The good news is that Daisy's parents have been moving out my stuff over the last week, and now only the big things remain. If the situation gets too weird I'm just going to cut my losses and sleep in Daisy's old room in her parent's house - but hopefully I can wait a couple more days.
That's right guys, Daisy's moved her flight and the apartment is all sorted! I'll be moving in almost a week sooner than I thought I would!! Only a few days more in this hellhole!!!
Maybe it's this knowledge that has made the apartment unbearable - just being soooo close to freedom yet not quite there yet? Who cares??? My next update will be as a free woman can you believe it? I'm so grateful for my surrogate family out here, and that they're taking this messy breakup so seriously. If you think the Reddit posts are paranoid, you guys should meet Daisy's parents bc tell me why I'm the ones reassuring them all the time?

Anyways, that's all the information I wanted to share with you guys, sorry that it's low-key a mental breakdown full of paranoia and insane behaviour. I'm not as mentally strong or mature as I thought I was, and I accept that.
Thank you again, Reddit, I hope you're all keeping well and know that I'm so very grateful for all your help and support. Until next time :D !!

EDIT: Several people have commented that I am an insane roommate for what I did, and I think that my previous posts have people confused about the lengths I've actually gone to. I have not used their toothbrushes in the toilet or hidden shrimp in the curtain rods (not that I was ever... that was a joke...), and if you want a list of the petty things I actually did you should check out the 'Mini-Update' post on my profile which is a comprehensive list.
As for people commenting to inform me that what I've done is an 'asshole move', yeah... I know that's the point. It's not possible to be petty without being an asshole that's quite literally the whole point. There's such conflicting advice that I'm tempted to just side with the people being polite to me, since most of the people calling me a 'psycho bitch' don't seem to know the full story (or care).

Sorry for elongating the post but it's so much worse to receive hate comments for being misunderstood than for things you actually did!! Thanks to everyone else who commented either in support or against my actions who were respectful and clear, I genuinely appreciate it and it's helped me figure out what I want to do next - will update tomorrow ❤️

>#[Notable Comments:]

>- Yeah I'm ngl this is maybe one of those times where listening to Reddit was a bit of a hasty move. It's one thing for someone on the internet to tell you to do something petty it's another thing to follow through. I think I was just tired of feeling like a victim, I wanted to do something strong and bold and petty because otherwise I'm just the ex gf who has been kicked to the side by her scumbag bf and... what... sat there and taken it? Done nothing? I genuinely feel like I'm going insane in this little guest bedroom and I need to get out.

>- To be honest I think this situation went from NTA to ESH.

>You are too old to be playing games. You're not 14.

>What is think has happened is this: 
>1. Stbxbf hates confrontation used you as excuse for friend not to move in - he's the ahole. 

>2. Friend harasses you and stbxbf does not fess up or defend you - he's the ahole. 

>3. Stbxbf moves in friend - he's the ahole. 

>4. Both of you stop communicating - esh. 

>5. You start to be rude he pretends nothing happened- esh. 

>6. You plot petty revenge, even seeking out suggestions - you starting to get obsessed so stepping in ah territory. 

>7. You have a ""double agent"" in friend group who you are conspiring with yet still zero communication with stbxbf - you are stepping more in ah territory. 

>8. Stbxbf has noticed you may be moving yet no one still communicating - esh. 

>9. You state you moved important documents and valuables, yet seem to think sentimental items (which i would consider valuables) are missing yet you don't know if you moved it or if stbxbf did - you are getting in your own head wrapped up in this game and drifting more into ah territory.

>I highly recommend you put your big girl pants on tell your stbxbf you need to speak privately (either at apartment or in public place) and once and for all communicate. Tell him your relationship is over and why (be adult about it), confirm you are indeed moving and when the plan is, and make it clear that you are fully aware of the half truths he told his friend group and that if he can't say anything nice then keep his mouth shut because you have evidence of the truth and not afraid st restore/defend your reputation because you will not put up with additional abuse like you already did with his friend.

>I think your stbxbf's whole personality change is because neither one of you are acting like adults and communicating. He hates confrontation but also seems very stubborn and is getting in his own head. He knows he messed up but is too much of an ahole to suck it up and try and resolve. You are no better as you won't communicate and are wrapped up in thinking about putting shrimp in curtain rods and glitter in pockets so now you're in your mind and projecting intent in his actions or inactions. I'm sure he is doing the same to you.

>Every action of either of you has a reaction. He acts like nothing happened, you go silent. You start moving all your stuff into guest room and put a lock on it (by a guy your stbxbf hears 2nd hand about and you all but admit you wanted him jealous) so he works to turn his friends against you. And so on.

>>- I definitely want to address a couple of points here, not bc I think I'm completely blameless but bc I think there are some points that misrepresent the situation as a whole. You'll probably read this and say that I'm still slightly an asshole, and I'll accept that, don't worry!

>>I don't believe that I ever stopped communicating with Sam, but obviously I'm very biased here. After he shouted at me about telling Max and refused to speak to me that night or the morning after, I became incredibly discouraged. When I said that he went back to normal after he moved Max in it doesn't mean that he magically became open to the conversation I wanted to have (I.e. 'The Max situation'), just that he stopped ignoring and snapping at me. Because of how negatively he reacted when I tried to communicate with him about the core of our issues, I stopped trying, because I didn't want to exacerbate an already tense situation. So, I don't know if I accept that I'm an AH in this respect necessarily bc I made genuine efforts to reach out to him and discuss this - but maybe I am slightly bc I gave up pretty easily after seeing his reactions.

>>I'm also not sure that you can say I'm being rude by either a) bringing up what happened when he tried to act normal, or b) ignoring him entirely. I haven't said a 'rude' word to Sam's face, only accused him of not putting me first or respecting me when I've tried to talk to him.

>>6/7. I think are valid, and if I'm honest about my emotions, I did want to be an asshole to them because I felt like I had been too much of a pushover or doormat. I know it doesn't excuse the actions, but I just want people to know that I didn't do petty things bc I ignorantly thought that they were the 'right' thing, but rather bc I felt if I did nothing I wouldn't standing up for myself. Your comments have helped me realise that I was wrong about that, and that I was actually not in a bad position before, just thinking badly of myself.

>>I texted Sam to inform him that I would be moving out - but I did snap at Max and tell him to mind his business, you're right. I was directing my anger at the wrong person, and I've since messaged him to apologise.

>>This comment pretty much sums up what happened, yeah - I think I've been playing mind games on myself without Sam or Max even needing to, and I'll accept that it makes me an asshole.

>>Thanks for taking the time out of your day to comment this, I seriously appreciate it even if it's criticism. Big girl pants coming soon - but right now they're at my friend's parents house with the rest of my worldly possessions.

>- While you're not entirely wrong, I think I can give myself a little bit of grace in this situation and try and defend myself slightly. I wanted to be an asshole, so I'm not going to sit here arguing that my actions are somehow good, but I also want to explain why I wanted to do this.

>For the last four (ish) days I've been holed up in the guest bedroom while my bf either a) acts like nothing happens, b) stonewalls me, c) glares at me. I have been and am miserable and if I'm honest I don't think that this situation is my fault anymore. According to Reddit I'm NTA for telling Max the truth and Sam is TA for moving Max in and not communicating with me. I've tried to talk to him about the living situation to make it bearable, but he either snaps at or ignores me and I don't want to make it more tense by forcing the conversation.

>What did my mind games accomplish? They made me feel like I wasn't a pushover. For every kind comment I get telling me that I'm a victim of a gaslighter, I get another telling me I'm the real spineless one for letting him treat me like that. I don't have that many people to talk to about this since my core friends have taken Sam's side, my new roommate is in a different time zone, and my boyfriend is the one I'm trying to complain about. Hence, I'm kind of in this Reddit bubble. So when I have several comments telling me that I should fuck with them, I jump to do it, because I don't know what I should be doing, just that I'm tired of sitting around doing nothing - of feeling like I am a victim - because I don't want to be.

>And yes, for a time I did feel better about myself. When my coworker installed a lock on my door and I saw Max texting Sam about it I felt like I'd really stuck it to them both - want to move in somewhere you're not welcome/move someone in without your gf's permission? Well here! Look at me! I can do something you don't like as well! You want to make me feel uncomfortable in my own home 24/7? I can psychologically torture you as well!

>Does it make me a good person? No, and I know it certainly doesn't make me mature or elegant or classy. I just wanted to feel different - or at least I hoped if I acted out enough maybe Sam would kick him out because he'd see just how upset I am. I'm sorry this has turned into an essay but it's hard to get the feelings and motivations I've had across in less words. And yeah, I get it now, that his actions aren't weird when you put them in the context of what I'm doing, and that's why I'm grateful that I turned to Reddit for a second opinion - because otherwise I feel like I would've kept thinking that I wasn't doing enough to stand up for myself.

>Thanks for your comment, and sorry if this reply is too lengthy to be readable, but at least I've gotten something off my chest. Hope you have a good day.

1fvwpme,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1fvwpme/an_open_letter_to_my_mom/,An open letter to my mom,"I struggle a lot in my 20s. I am 26yo now. I made a lot of mistakes that I totally regret and still feeling lost trying to find my purpose in life. No I am not depressed, I still have some happy days but they don't last long. What I do know is that I still have a lot of questions to you hoping to find some answers without asking you. 

When I try to relieve my childhood, there's many of you in it. Bad ones. You used to beat me (really hard). At 7yo, you locked me out of the house to sleep in our backyard. You made me beg for food. You made me cry for a blanket. Everytime you have the opportunity, you slapped me, you pushed me and pulled my hair. I was going to school crying with a dirty uniform because you pushed me on the floor where I accidentally spilled your coffee. 

You hated me. You hated my presence. You hated that I was a girl and you only loved my brothers. One time we went to Baclaran and you got out of the bus without looking back. I tried to follow you but I got lost, then I panicked and had asthma attack and collapsed. I remember calling you ""mom"" but you never looked back as if you want me to get lost like I am some kind of a dog that you want to disown. Next thing I saw was you crying rushing into my arms (as if I got lost in the crowd and you didn't do that on purpose)

You used to bring me along when you're going to meet your lover. I was 8yo. You introduced him as your ""bestfriend"". I knew already there's something wrong when I saw his hand on your lap when we were inside his car. I was in denial thinking a different scenario not until I saw you both naked with my own eyes. Not until I saw your naughty exchanges in text messages. Why would you do that to me? Worst of it all, I tried telling my siblings, but they didn't believe me. I was devastated.

You said so many awful things to me. Things such as, I was worthless and that you wished you just aborted me when you had the chance. You told me that I wasn't capable of anything. You told me that I was naive and dumb and I will stay that way forever. In highschool, you and my dad were almost fighting everyday. It was toxic. You physically abused each other, not caring for what memory it may instill to your children. You and dad both cheated. You're both horrible. Both of you were absent during my achievements. You weren't there for those times that I wanted to make you both proud. You were both so busy pointing fingers to each other that you didn't care for your children. 

In college, I started to get in relationships. I found out how horrible this affected me so much to the point that I was always insecure, angry and just the amount of hatred for other people. My exes told me that I was just like you. It made me so mad that I just wanted to end my life because I didn't want to be like you. I never wanted to be. 

You criticized me for being an average student. You wanted a daughter to fulfill your dreams when you were a teenager. You wanted me to be a flight attendant. You wanted someone whom you can brag to your friends. But I never let you. You never acknowledged the fact that I finished college on time and got a corporate job at the age 19yo. Ofcourse, you'll never do that. 

Now I am 26yo, still wanting to ask these questions to you. Why? Because I keep on fucking up every relationship that I have. Because I don't know my worth. You never taught me what love is. You never taught me what love I deserve. You never told me that I am worthy of something. I don't know these things. I know it's lame because at this point in my life, I have choices. It's my choice to live this way. But it hurts me so much that you robbed me of a good childhood. What were you thinking?

I tried telling my kuyas and ate but the same response over and over again ""hindi lang ikaw nakaranas nyan"". When will ever someone listen to me? and what hurts me the most, when will you be sorry?

Right now, I live alone. I don't care. My siblings gets mad when you needed something and I didn't care. You were never a mom to me. Sad part is, there are times that I am still longing for a parent. But I never had one. I had Dad at some point but he's gone now. So I am just all by myself.",1,1728040739.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

1fvwpbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReclaimTheShame/comments/1fvwpbb/part_23_unhingedoversharerenabler/,"Part 2/3 (#Unhinged,#OverSharer,#Enabler)","Compassion fade for the hub has become so bad that it’s a crap shoot on whether our 911 calls for concerns outside of “non-responsive” will be taken seriously, often not…. until its too late. But Mayor, our EMS teams are swamped all over the city…they are so overwhelmed that they have to triage just as the hospitals do. Those concerns get missed for so long that we see escalations. There was a neighborhood post where someone talked of calling for someone being on their property. They had been told that police were busy dealing with more serious issues such as assaults. This person then took that as “oh ok, that’s what I need to do to get you out here” & chose to go after the person themselves. Again: it’s not just the hub. Many are getting desperate on all sides. With that, our helping professions are in tangent, overwhelmed by Compassion Fatigue (also known as secondary traumatic stress), which comes from carrying other people’s stress for prolonged periods, to a point where we gradually lose compassion for others & lose empathy. **BURN OUT.** But those of us around the hub: WE STILL CARE. I’ve noticed people who had to pull back from burn out also care too, just reached a point of feeling so helpless that they couldn’t continue trying to help. We are tired of watching this happen. I have watched in all walks of my life how the systems fail us all here. I have seen courts fail many of my community siblings since childhood. I have seen it fail many of the people I try to advocate for. I have seen where people feel there’s no point in reporting things like sexual assault because of systemic flaws & cognitive bias & suffer in silence as the systems either take advantage further of their traumas, or let them slip between the cracks, & blame them for their own coping mechanisms.

One of the biggest examples of compassion fade, most especially bias, displays itself in the push for alcohol in convenience stores. Mayor, do you not see how ironic it is for you to have demanded our safe consumption site be shut down, but the next week your government roles out easier access to alcohol? You do realise we kept LCBO open during the pandemic as HARM REDUCTION, right? We knew our healthcare system couldn’t take the additional pressure, because withdrawal from alcohol addictions can literally kill you. Society & our government only seem to care about addictions related to uncontrolled substances. If you look through statistics through [CAMH.ca](http://CAMH.ca) on *Mental Illness and Addiction: Facts and Statistics*, they breakdown economic costs (\~$40 billion) of substance use in Canada, where alcohol ($14.6 billion) & tobacco ($12 billion) makes up two thirds of costs in relation to our “healthcare, criminal justice & loss of productivity”. In contrast, opioid related costs: $3.5 billion. Yet you gave alcoholics easier access to their addiction while closing down our site that mitigates the dangers associated with addiction.

In continuing my life story, I tried factory work sometime after call center. At this job, I got my first car, which seemed like I was finally succeeding. The work politics around it though showed patterns of modern slavery. 3^(rd) party temp workers who were there before me were the one’s showing me my job better than trainers. However, I got hired off the street with no experience for the job they applied for with 6 months+ experience. They hired us on 1 year “temp” contracts with midway raises. I purposely picked the press that everyone hated, got good at it & loved it…until it started spitting out double the plastic I was supposed to cut. I had to do double the work & was expected to keep up the same rate. When I went to HR with concerns of it being unrealistic & causing me problems, I was told “well we already slowed it down” & to just keep running it. I ended up going to the doctors the next day & was diagnosed with carpal tunnel from overworking it. When I went back to work for my next shift, they had put two other people on the same press that I had been forced to keep running solo. When my review came up for my raise after, they refused, claiming poor work quality. I ended up quitting, because it wasn’t worth breaking myself for a job that treats workers as expendable. I had another job lined up right after that. I scarcely ever quit a job without having another one to go to.

The next job I ended up having to leave for mental health/injury was my other wrist being overworked, & the toxicity from our supervisor was so bad that they had 5+ people come & go (small business) in less than a year of my being there. It affected me mentally because I loved that job, & I was good at it until they fired the most experienced person & expected me to fill their shoes on a whole other station, with entire shifts being repetitive fine detail work. When I got diagnosed for carpal tunnel in this wrist, they victim blamed me for the consequences of their crappy expectations, claiming I must have been predisposed & tried to pressure me into quitting claiming I wasn’t “cut out” for it. Other workers didn’t complain, & just wore wrist braces to try to compensate. My physio later confirmed I was not predisposed, & that no one should be doing straight days of repetitive motions like that. I have never had issues with my wrists since. The work environment got so toxic after, that as I would be stopping for coffee on the way to work, I would start having panic attacks where I couldn’t pull out of the parking lot for half hour, until I gave up & called in sick. I was on WSIB, & got stress notes from my Dr., but WSIB insisted I had to get diagnosed from a psychiatrist for that claim. However, when I called each one in town, they all said they were no longer accepting WSIB patients as they were backlogged. The stress of it all was not worth hanging onto a job with such toxic people.

 I decided to take the summer a little more at ease for my mental health, & to spend more time with my child. I worked a part time job that I loved & had amazing employers (RIP P.D) & a fantastic work environment. Every shift I worked with them left me feeling content & appreciated, even though I was inexperienced with the products we sold. They were patient with me though, & it was so refreshing. It was the break I needed to recover my previous job. However, as the season was coming to an end & I was starting to look for a new fulltime job (the tour season was up for the current), I was hit by another driver. Soon as it happened, I remember feeling the dread pour into my gut as I realised things were never going to be the same, & I felt like I could sense a total backslide. Kicker of it all though, is I still knew how lucky I had been that it wasn’t worse. It took a while to get my insurance to give me income replacement though. They almost refused & I had to push for it, as they weren’t counting the full-time job I had worked before the part time. At least I didn’t end up needing CERB that everyone is currently owing back. The world slowed down around me when I was suddenly forced into needing to take it slow.

My car was a write-off. I ended up having to pay out over $5K out of pocket as I didn’t understand gap insurance when I got it. This accident caused my mental health to slip. My old doctor refused to get me tested for it because I refused to be medicated (common issue that stop many from wanting to get help that they need). I knew that CBT worked for me, & during my studies I discovered there is not enough research for CBT as more doctors need to refer patients to help with the case studies. Pharmaceuticals get pushed first though, even though it is known that there are many side effects, & its literally trial/error to get the “right” one. Some side effects are scarier than the initial reason for taking them. This Dr. set barriers that made it impossible for me to get the supports I needed, & it took months of hoop jumping to get counselling through my insurance. My mental health may not have been as heavily affected if the system side effects, & its literally trial with insurance companies wasn’t so flawed. I am still waiting to be tested for PTSD to this day but have suspected it ever since. When I moved for school, the campus health helped me get on the waitlist last fall. **Still waiting**, just so you know how long it is for us to get mental health help in Ontario & that its really not easy. This was also supposed to be a faster list dedicated to students. My physical injuries are also still present, & I lost a lot of my independence with these injuries as well as losing my car & ability to get around easily. Insurance covered physio & counselling for my first year, but they subjected me to 3^(rd) party assessments & deemed me as “fine”. But I wasn’t fine & am still not.

 In some of those assessments, while they had me lifting & turning all sorts of ways, I straight up asked the specialist “when I'm locked up tomorrow, do I call you & tell you about it?"" I had previously explained that the issue isn't that I can't do something in the moment, but that I end up locked up & in severe pain the next. The specialist flat out told me “Don’t focus on tomorrow, focus on today"" & dismissed my concerns. The next day, I was so locked up & in so much pain that I couldn't sit up properly to even use the bathroom. I had to lean on my legs entirely for support & was in the worst pain that I've ever been. Another assessment was done virtual because of covid, where the assessor barely looked at me for the 10 min call, as they told me to do range of motion stretches on the cam. That one said I was fine based strictly off of what my “original diagnosis” expected heal time was. Not actually based of what I was enduring. They cut my physio off, & I had to keep pushing through life in pain that would flare up any time I did too much. Walking around the mall for half hour: locked up for \~3 days. Lifted a mattress up: retriggered to the point I needed physio to “unlock” the lockup. Trying to work, I couldn’t do more than 1 day & would take several days to recover again. The one job I did try to push through ended up letting me go because they needed someone who could keep up better.

I am still not fully recovered both mentally & physically. Anyone in cars with me can see even as a passenger that I still have adverse reactions. Yet the mental health assessor deemed me as fine. Throughout that assessment, as we analysed my whole life, they kept using the word “resilient.” This rapidly became like a bad word to me, as I am sure many foster kids can relate. Its not like we chose to be, but it was that or die/fade away. The thing this assessor didn’t recognise is that my resiliency was fading drastically, & I internalize more than show on the outside. At this point, every hit that came after in life was so much harder to get back up. Where once I may have been able to agree with them & be proud, I just felt more defeated as this word became a double-edged sword & I lost the benefits I was getting when deemed “fine”. They also ask questions about daily living activities, & I still get “test anxiety” when I get asked those questions. I learned to compensate to avoid reinjuring, & since I lived with others, I got help with activities I couldn’t do solo. So really, I was just lucky. But I shouldn’t have to depend on others so much. They shouldn’t have to give up their time to help me either. Toxic roommates previously would use it as ammo against me like currency. I ended up feeling stuck because of this dependency. Still do sometimes even though I have awesome roommates who don’t mind helping because we found a balance. But there is guilt still that comes with it.

I took my counsellors advice & applied for school despite not being ok, pushing myself to try to force myself into being ok because I felt I had no other options. I was skeptical of doing this without a car with the distance, but I got in & took the train back & fourth for the first two years, because even with OSAP (which was higher than most because of my demographics), roommates, & high credit score, we couldn’t get a place. I really don’t understand how people are still ignorant to the housing crisis & judge people who are less fortunate than us. However, I continued school & was able to get some accommodations to try to help with my physical & mental health needs. I was often exhausted after classes, & sitting in the chairs all day left me in a lot of pain by the end of the day. I did everything I could to keep up. I was eventually able to secure housing closer to school with roommates I adore, to help balance our cost of living (yet again, I am privileged while many are not). I was able to get my harm reduction job & they were very flexible with my school needs as well as mental health & physical limitations. But I couldn’t keep up with school. Things in life still kept happening one thing after the other, & that resiliency kept fading.

The adjustment from the move was a lot more than I could predict & timing was bad. Trying to keep up with school exhausted me so much, combined with physical limitations, which led to me not fully unpacking even a year later (& counting). I didn't get a chance to enjoy my new town. Life should have been easier moving closer to school & away from the toxicity I lived in prior. It was a pattern of school, work, being a mom of a teen who just got uprooted entirely as they started high school. I was exhausted all the time. My child barely saw much of me during school terms because I was either doing homework or falling asleep wherever I sat (low stamina is another affect since my accident). I was burning out & in survival mode way longer than I realised until I froze up on everything. I needed a pause; I couldn't keep up on homework because I was getting panic attacks as I tried to do the assignments. Try doing a test on cortisol & the stress response while enduring the symptoms (brain fog being a big one) & not being able to do anything about it. I eventually got through it, but every assignment after that caused more panic, where I would freeze up as my fight or flight response.

Term prior, I had tried to do placement for school & ended up having to withdraw medically because I couldn’t keep up. With placement, it was fulltime hours of constant moving, & a massive assignment that was mostly homework each night in addition. There was no room for my accommodation needs (time extensions, & later: reduced courseload), or to fit in tutoring I was supposed to have access to, combined with my injuries & lack of support from our program when enduring hurdles/roadblocks. It was also compressed terms: the first part, when we still had classes, had us doing midterms only 3 weeks into September. I don’t think any of us realised what that meant when they told us ahead of time. Just as how I don’t think any of us realised just how bad the lack of resources in our elementary schools are. Not only were us students not prepared, but neither were the schools we were sent to help. They don’t have enough help for themselves with how the government cut back funding. We knew of this from outside views. However, a lot of us witnessed a lot of kids needing help, & a broken system where they are not getting it. Again, I’m not supposed to talk about this, but we all really need to be.

So many people should be standing up for our teachers & EAs. There are some amazing people out there trying their best, & so many burning out. I loved the staff, but with the bounds of our assignments, I was helpless with the way both our own school system is running, as well as the way the placement schools have to run without the proper resources to run efficiently. Something I noticed swiftly, is that when a lot of kids are together, & many don’t feel like they are getting the attention they need, they will learn behaviours off of each other. What started as a few kids with difficult behaviours turned into many kids with similar behaviours. I am sure many of you might recognise this, as in our neighborhood pages, the odd cry for help comes up as parents seek social media to try to get advice while waiting for the mental healthcare systems to catch up. Again, the government really needs to WAKE UP & give their heads a shake. PLEASE.

At the start of our program, we started with over 80. We were told by several that by the end of the course, we would dwindle down to about 20 or less. This was stated as though it was a student problem, but the schools are not recognising that this is a **system problem**. Their expectations are way too high, & not practical with other needs of life. I had set days I committed to for work & had planned to pick up extras between. I couldn’t pick up the extras because I had no time or energy. IT SHOULDN’T HAVE TO BE THIS HARD. But yet again, I had OSAP, so I was more privileged. The empath in me though, & caring for my friends, was torn up at how many of my classmates I saw burning themselves out trying to keep up. No one had the energy to speak out on it though. Whenever I complained to work friends about the ridiculous pressures, any of the ones who took the course themselves would often nod their heads in agreement to how messed up the school system is. I just want to add though too, it wasn’t just our program. I had friends in other programs that felt the same pressure. I also want to add, that its not just my school either. I have friends at other colleges/universities who experience the same. The pressure has become socially acceptable as “that’s just how it is” instead of recognising that it shouldn’t be. What does it really serve to push us this hard, besides exploiting people & lowering our standards of work? We need people in these fields, so why not make it easier to learn & balance life healthily so we can fill in the gaps in our city/province? It became clear that quantity & greed became more important than quality or social needs. Look at the way schools exploit our international students without even helping them secure proper housing. There was news on multiple people sharing a room. When did ANY of this become so socially accepted? But I digress…

When I froze up on my assignments, it became clear that I would need to seek additional mental health help in the community for the panic attacks. I had to compartmentalise my school needs with the school counsellor, & everything else in life with a community one.  So, I sought out other resources. You’d think a Psych student would be able to seek this out easily, but again, we don’t have enough resources in Ontario for **ANYONE**. So please, PLEASE stop victim blaming people who need help as though resources are readily available. **THEY ARE NOT!** I tried several places before I found one that would add me to their waitlist. Only reason I got on that list was because of a technicality where I endured certain traumas as a child that they were specialised in, but ones I had already healed from due to foster care programs. I still ended up on a waitlist though, with a minimum 3 month wait time. This meant that I would not likely get the help I needed before the term ended & furthered my panic/anxiety. I kept pushing through school though, & at least showed up to classes, did the tests & group assignments. I was working out a plan with my school counsellor to keep up the best I could. The plan, while waiting for community supports that I needed, was to apply for an extension at the end of term so that I could continue going to school on the routine days in tangent with tutoring, until I finished the other assignments that I froze up on. I made it almost 3 months, but the term ended & my application for the extension was rejected. Despite having support from the wellness team, doctors’ notes, & advocacy from teachers, I was rejected because of a stupid policy that doesn’t even make sense: my “grades were too low”. No student is going to bother to apply for an extension if their grades are anything over a pass. “D’s & C’s get degrees” was a common catch phrase amongst some students. We lived by that because we didn’t have time or mental energy to care. We just wanted the torture over with as soon as possible. With that said, when I was able to keep up, I had maintained a 4.0 average or pretty damn close to. I just needed a pause to recoup a little. So many of us needed that. Despite pushing myself 3 months more through the mental health struggles & trying to follow the rules the best I could, I was forced to withdraw. I had no choice, & it was clear that I wasted my time & energy trusting in a system built for failure. I will have to redo that term plus the previous placement all over again. It didn’t matter how passionate I was. We are taught in school how to break things down into more manageable steps & how to advocate for our future clients, but when we tried to self advocate, we often were unsupported & not respected enough. We were often told about how the system just didn’t work for the needs we needed. We had to cater the system, even if we had medical accommodation needs that weren’t compatible. Not only had I frozen up, but life still kept throwing me one curveball after another.

Since April, I decided to take the summer to try to get better, committing to self-improvement goals one day at a time. I knew I couldn't commit to extra shifts without risking burning myself out more, & I needed to pause a bit to try to enjoy my place & life. I tried getting into music more to try to alleviate some pressure of cost of living, while embracing a hobby that usually relieves stress. I walked into the wrong place accidentally on a really rough day & back out for the intended one to drop my child off where he needed to go. After: I walked back into it, broken & crumbling, & asked what the building had for resources. I couldn’t even speak to the receptionist without breaking down. That day was a turning point, starting with the receptionist giving me a hug & letting me cry on their shoulder for a moment, something I desperately needed, but couldn’t really get earlier in the day until that moment. Those who give free hugs in public places: never stop doing that, because you never know just how much it can save someone.

From their, the receptionist heard my present circumstances & needs & started connecting me right away with all they could provide. Yet again: I got lucky, & the workers happened to have a slot available to take me in right then. I started meeting with these community resources to try to better understand what exactly there is that can help me. My mental health had slid so much that I couldn't even make calls to the foodbank, despite needing it, without having a support worker sit beside me to work through it together at the start of summer. The thought of calling, even with them there, made my throat & chest hurt from sheer anxiety, & we had to sit outside instead of in their office. The thought of having to go through hoops to get help I know I need but knowing I could be rejected no matter how much I try: it's crippling having this happen over & over again. This happened in so many ways these past 4+ years, & every time I got rejected after putting effort in, I could literally feel my usual resiliency (& all it’s double-edged sword effects) fade more & more each time.

With the help of a worker in the community, I decided to apply for ODSP. This is something I probably should have done years before, but I didn't have faith or mental energy to go through the process until I had a worker willing to sit with me through every step. I lived in denial of just how bad things were for me while I tried to keep up with “status quo”/ “fake it ‘til you make it”. I was warned by other mental health workers about how the system works: that they auto reject the first applications by default no matter what, as a way to try to ween people out. **People like me.** I knew soon as I was told this, with my style of internalised anxiety, that this system is built to literally make us give up early on in, so that they don’t have to help us. While I was enduring this: people I worked with had no idea unless I directly told them, because at work, I was ok. My anxiety is more “high functioning” when I am in public…. usually. When asked why I didn’t work fulltime, I had internal panic as I tried to explain why I couldn’t. Same kind of panic as I get with test anxiety, in which I couldn’t elaborate until later, when I typed it out instead, as well as how much I admired those that could.  I went months longer before I could find help to go through the process, needing to be pushed not to just give up as I had nothing in me left. It’s excruciating pushing through the process while knowing I am one of those who would just give up because my stress response is “freeze” or depression sleep, while knowing how sensitive I am now to rejection with how much I’ve endured thus far. We started the ODSP application in the summer. I did intake for another local mental health resource to help me get moving in life again at the same time I was applying for ODSP, but they told me they couldn’t help me because I don’t have an official diagnosis. Reminder: I am still on a waitlist to be tested for the mental health conditions I already know from my education that I have. Try knowing the science behind what you have, but not being able to do fk all about it besides play by the systematic games.

When I applied for ODSP, I was told they would send me paperwork in the mail for my doctor & I to fill out as a key part of the process. To be ready for this, I booked an appointment ahead, expecting those papers to be on their way. The appointment alone couldn’t be sooner than a month & a half. Should have been plenty of time for me to get forms in the mail, right? Wrong! 2 days before my appointment, I called ODSP. They told me my case was transferred to a whole other town, hours from here. I called that office, & switchboard told me I didn’t have a case worker yet, despite me having been told I was assigned one at this office. When I told them I didn’t get the forms, they told me they didn’t send them yet as they had to find out if I was “financially eligible” first. I asked if there was any way my doctor could fill these forms out some other way to expedite this fast as I can’t afford rent (borrowed money from family/friends two months in a row), & they refused. I mentioned that my disabilities were already proven & documented for OSAP prior, & I was still only working the same hours as I had reported to them, asking them if they could just look at the other government records: they refused. I asked them how long it would take to get those forms, & I was told 6-9 months. I pointed out on the phone that they were putting me in a catch 22: if I force myself to work more shifts to make ends meet, then I look like I am not financially eligible, & even if I get a doctors note vouching that I shouldn’t be working those, as I am not mentally or physically able to: it doesn’t make a difference to them. They told me to apply for OW, which I can already see I would technically make too much to qualify with what few shifts I work, or if I pick up extras. When I saw my doctor & told them about the call to ODSP, they flat out told me “That’s wrong” & told me I should have pushed for a case worker. I broke down in their office saying “How am I supposed to know that? How do I know I have the right to ask for that, when I already thought, I was talking to the person I needed?”. We booked an appointment for a few weeks later, in which they agreed to call on my behalf if my own calls were being dismissed. For the record, my doctor is WONDERFUL, & I am lucky to have them now. This was our first meeting as I was just assigned one. So far: I haven’t mustered up the mental energy to make the call myself yet, but I keep trying each day to do so, sitting staring at the phone or the number written on the paper, whilst also trying not to puke as the panic sets in just thinking about it. I am no longer in a position mentally to be able to self advocate, & the resources I need are not there when I do. I have already exhausted those.

I chose not to apply for OW when applying for ODSP because I know how intrusive they are from when I tried to apply before when I moved here & was rejected. I put a lot of work into jumping through their hoops then, & I don't have mental energy right now to jump through them again with no hope that it would even suffice.  Not to mention with my roommate situation, there’s many more hoops I must jump through where I would have to get letters to prove what they are giving to me is for rent (which is in my name, as with other shared expenses).

All of this systemic catch 22 was literally happening the same week as the tragedy at the hub.  Work was the only hope & grounding I had. It was a big part of my healing journey, as picking up extras day by day gave me empowerment & control of my life as I felt capable. Having more pre-scheduled shifts would have been a pressure, where if I couldn’t make it: I would feel guilt for letting my team down. We felt pressure when people called in sick & short staffing days would result in parts of our services getting closed. The way I was working allowed me to analyse myself as the days came, & people appreciated me for picking up extras when I could so that we didn’t have to close any of our services. I could make their night better by showing up. It was a win/win that started helping me heal, & I had planned to use ODSP temporarily until I was able to go often enough that I could handle more scheduled shifts. I had an entire temporary healing plan, & that just got ripped away from me the same time as I lost my community & my purpose. I won’t be able to qualify for EI since you need 600+ hours to get it, & I won’t likely get hired on anywhere else with my physical limitations & current mental health issues, limiting my availability. The hub was special. I wish so badly the city realised that more. Last winter, in a town close to here where I lived before, overdoses were on the rise. One of my friends from my past was found behind a safe supply spot, where it was obvious they likely would have used a supervised site if there had been one & would have had a likelier chance of being saved (Rip C.E). Learning of this & trying to help push for a safe consumption site there, is where my mental health spiraled. Where school became heavier, & my work became even more important to me & my core values. It wasn’t just about the people we served; it was about all parts of the community within. We all were on healing journeys in some way, & the work we did gave us purpose & gave us positives to cling to when our worlds were dark.

These systems aren't designed to help those in need as they are supposed to, or how people assume they are, & they are failing us all. We can see the system failing our most vulnerable too, worse I reckon that how I have explained it failing me. I've wanted to speak out on all of this for so long, but I didn’t feel like I had a right to be able to speak my story because my story is not nearly as bad as most of the people around me. What right do I have to think that my story is going to make a difference? Why does my story deserve to be heard when so many others behind me deserve to be heard as well? More so even, as many have already hit points where they seem broken, & where they can’t speak anymore for themselves. I am breaking too as systems continue to fail me as they have all my life, & you took away my community. But I have too much around me, & people dependent on me to just lose it.  But then, what can I do? This was the only option I had left, to share my story & try to tie in all the things I learned through school & lived experience combined. I hope that more people will feel inspired to share their stories, so we can unite & push to change these systems. I tried to play the games & follow the rules of them best I can, but IT DIDN’T MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I am still not ok, & I have been suffering in silence (#FkSilence) for far too long. Many of us have. When I see people judge others for hardships they endure as though they ""chose"" that life: it's infuriating because they didn't have any choice any more than I've had myself. I relate with them because I see them in survival mode too, just as I have been for years now, struggling to get by one day at a time. I am SO tired. Seeing the hate in society added to my struggles with school as the things I was learning were not being applied in the real world. I would give people harm reduction information to counter ignorance & stigmas, & they would claim I was “spreading false information” & be called an enabler. Mayor: It is your job to listen to the facts & lead with the knowledge, not cater to ignorance of stigma.

There was a project for school where we had to run a debate. We chose safe consumption sites & decriminalizing drugs before I had even heard of the hub. We thought it would be an easy A, but with the rules of having to use academic research: we quickly found it was not. In this, we could find so much information for the pro side, to legalise drugs & implement safe consumption sites, but nothing to support the con side as to harms it brings. One of my roommates was originally against these kinds of places, but was helping me paw through 2 pages worth of links alone to try to find something we could use for the con side. In the end, I asked them what they thought now, in which they responded: “the numbers speak for themselves”. During this research, we still didn’t hear of the hub. The information we got was from BC & other countries such as Portugal. However, this research highlighted how much it saved taxpayer money, both in healthcare costs in mitigating damage, as well as criminal justice costs & crime rates around the cities they were in. In his talk: War on Drugs is a War on Addicts, Gabor Mate explains:

“By criminalizing addiction we are failing to address the root causes of drug abuse. Take, for example, the case of veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Nationally we are seeing an uptick in the number of veterans incarcerated in our prisons & jails, many of them suffering PTSD. One study estimated that nearly half of the 207,161 Iraq & Afghanistan war veterans formally diagnosed with PTSD have had contact with our criminal justice system. This is due in large part to rising rates of drug addiction, particularly due to prescription painkillers. If there was any evidence that locking people up for ever longer periods of time is reducing drug trade, is reducing drug violence, is reducing drug use, you might make a case for it, but there's no such case to be made. If we incarcerate people for longer & longer, we're not doing it because there's any proof that's going to do any good. We're doing it because it satisfies our political purposes. We're not increasing the safety of our children, of ourselves, or of our society. The more childhood adversity there is, the greater the risk of addiction because that's the source of the pain that people try to escape from.”

In our project, we were using academic articles showing that harm reduction approaches, & meeting clients where they are at results in them being more likely to getting help, & for that help to be more effective than the old models. I do not have the mental energy to research those articles again, but Mayor: you should! You really need to learn this too, through academic articles, where the research must follow moral standards & integrity. If not: then listen to those who are more trained on this, such as Gabor Mate. Listen also to the ted talk by Johann Hair *Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong,* where he explains very well about how our current approaches are wrong in the learning journey he took for himself & he challenges stigma’s by starting with himself. In this video, Johann describes the experiment done by Bruce Alexander involving rats:

“You get a rat & you put it in a cage, & you give it two water bottles: one is just water, & the other is water laced with either heroin or cocaine. If you do that, the rat will almost always prefer the drug water & almost always kill itself quite quickly. So, there you go, right? That's how we think it works. In the '70s, Professor Alexander comes along & he looks at this experiment & he noticed something. He said ah, we're putting the rat in an empty cage. It's got nothing to do except use these drugs. Let's try something different. So, Professor Alexander built a cage that he called ‘Rat Park’, which is basically heaven for rats. They've got loads of cheese, they've got loads of colored balls, they've got loads of tunnels. **Crucially**, **they've got loads of friends**. They can have loads of sex. & they've got both the water bottles, the normal water & the drugged water. But here's the fascinating thing: In Rat Park, they don't like the drug water. They almost never use it. None of them ever use it compulsively. None of them ever overdose. **You go from almost 100 percent overdose when they're isolated to zero percent overdose when they have happy & connected lives**.”",1,1728040707.0,ReclaimTheShame,0,1.0,False
1fvwp3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/1fvwp3r/first_time_growing_potatoes/,First time growing potatoes,"Hi reddit, first time posting here, looking for a little advice. I'm an armature gardener with a bit of a brown thumb, I've killed almost every plant I've tried to raise. I'm trying to grow yukon gold potatoes for the first time, and it was going well, but I've had a few bumps on the road. Mostly here looking for advice from more experienced gardeners on thing I could be doing better, how I could correct my mistakes, tips and tricks, ect. 

I live in an apartment, so I'm growing them in 5 gallon buckets with holes drilled in the bottom on my back porch. (hell yeah to Firehouse subs for not inflating the price of the pickle buckets, easiest and cheapest way to get your hands on food grade 5 gallon buckets) I made my own custom soil blend based n some research I did; 1 part coffee grounds, 1 part bone meal, 2 parts course sand, 8 parts worm castings, 8 parts perlite, 8 parts peat moss, 16 parts generic soil mix. I planted my seed potatoes, watered them with a homemade calcium acetate fertilizer (apple cider vinegar and eggshells, diluted 1 tablespoon of vinegar mix to 4 cups of water)

Here's one part where I know I messed up. Two out of seven seed potatoes sprouted, one teeny tiny one that grew about 3 inches in two weeks since it poked up, and one seed that was strong and healthy enough to make two sprouts that went from 2 inches tall to 5 inches in 3 days. However when I dug them up to transplant them into their own buckets, and found that the reason only two sprouted as because I way WAY overwatered them. the other 5 had completely decomposed and become one with the soil and the two sprouts have some serious root rot. I went ahead with transplanting them, made sure their soil was just barely damp this time. It's been a week, and they don't seem to be dying, but that definitely aren't growing. The big ones were visibly bigger every day, but they haven't grown since transplanting. Do I just need to wait a while for them to take hold in the ne soil? Is there anything I can do o help their root rot? Any other advice for a newbie?

Almost forgo, I'm in growing zone 8a",3,1728040683.0,gardening,1,1.0,False

1fvwnh3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fvwnh3,My take on red,"Does this even count as a red challenge submission? Lol

I don't have many solid colored red garments but I do have 3 pairs of red shoes and several accessories including my favorite red knit beanie, which is always the perfect finishing touch for my winter outfits. For me, red has a certain intensity that requires the right mood to wear it without feeling like it's wearing me. I can say this about all colors but red, especially, adds extra excitement when paired with other colors. Being able to wear them in small doses when I don't feel like going all in has a lot of impact for me. 

Slide 1: This is an outfit I wore to the office yesterday and felt really good in. In the morning, while drinking my coffee, I spent a few minutes scanning my closet in Indyx and added pieces I wanted to wear into the outfit generator. It started with pants ideas and went from there. This saves me a lot of time on days I need to leave the house quickly and can't be bothered trying on a bunch of different outfits. What I loved about the final outfit is how much ease and comfort I felt. I'm leaning into neutrals but the pops of color and less formal pants paired with the blazer still felt interesting and professional enough. I've made peace with the fact that I'm never going to be the most refined person in the room. The turned up pants hem, relaxed blazer and non- matchy colors felt like me. No one saw my socks, they're a silly reminder to not be so serious. 

Slide 2: My outfit ideas vs. the final result in Indyx. I tried all the blue pieces first and whoa, way too intense for what I was feeling but could be fun to try another day when I have the energy for it. 

Slide 3: A compilation of my favorite red outfits over the past year. ",10,1728040509.0,RitaFourEssenceSystem,1,1.0,False

1fvwmx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/irishpersonalfinance/comments/1fvwmx3/taking_advantage_of_new_lower_fixed_rates/,Taking advantage of new lower fixed rates,"Sorry for the question that might sounds stupid as I didn't had my coffee yet. As you might know, ECB introduced interest rate cut. I got into 5 year fixed AIB green mortgage, and Im 5 months in it, and may current rate is 3.55%

AIB said that it's possible for me to switch to 3.3% rate, without any penalty. This would be decrease my monthly payments by 29 euro (from 917 euro), but in return, my 5 year time will start from beginning.

Does it worth taking this action? (I know that ECB is planning to decrease rates in the future) Most of my mortgage payments went to interest rate instead of principal (which is how mortgage works) let's say 2k around principal and 2.5k for interest.

I will be paying €1740 less in whole of the 5 year fixed period, but I feel like if I do this I will pay more to interest rate and less to principal.

So does it make sense to take this action or not really?",1,1728040452.0,irishpersonalfinance,2,1.0,False

And my new car turned into a moving trashcan or perhaps it was the scent of stale food that finally got to me. Either way, I knew it was time for a proper cleaning.

So I went to a car cleaning service center in Delhi, and a squad of car cleaning experts was standing at my place. These guys meant some serious business. They had all high-end tech tools with vacuum cleaners, sprays, and some tools that looked like from a science-fiction movie.

They took my car keys I didn’t even have to move a muscle they Just told me to sit on a couch, I was just watching them, and they offered me a coffee. I was only looking there work from a distence. I went to near to service area and one of the workers asked me to take any essential thing for your car before I start interior cleaning. I said no no I have nothing that important in my car, and they started their work and now they even vacuumed out the old French fry that had somehow found its way under my seat (don’t ask how long it had been there). and one of the guys joked  “This could’ve been your emergency snake during Delhi traffic”. I had a good laugh and said yeah it was an emergency snake.

After about forty-five minutes later to a gleaming car smelling like new and almost felt guilty getting in it with my shoes on.

So, if you ever find yourself rolling through Delhi in a dust-covered disaster like I was, trust me with my experience I would say a car cleaning service from GoMechanic is the way to go.

1fvwh37,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1fvwh37/decaf_works_better_than_sedatives/,Decaf Works Better Than Sedatives,"Ten days ago, I quit nicotine after five years of heavy use. Starting on Day 2, I stopped having any cravings—only experiencing some mild physical symptoms, which felt more like hyperactivity than anxiety.

Why? Because I realized that I actually didn’t need or want cigarettes. All that time I was smoking, I thought they helped me concentrate, stay awake, boost cognitive function, and socialize.

But once I quit, I realized I felt much better in all the areas I thought would be negatively affected if I stopped smoking.

With that realization, I decided to dig deeper and make another change: quit coffee.

And… Hahaha… My whole adulthood was a lie.

The entire time I was drinking coffee, I thought I needed more and more of it to concentrate, boost creativity, energy, be active in conversations. But…

It was a delusion. Once I quit coffee, I became calmer, my anxiety decreased (despite my nicotine withdrawal). My energy became more stable throughout the day, and I stopped having occasional weird heartbeats, headaches, and brain fog.

And sleep… My sleep improved so much.

What do you think about coffee and how it affects you?",1,1728039851.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

# FordFingerFriday and a trip down memory lane...Boston is a hub of my life, somewhere that I've spent a considerable amount during my growth and transition phases. This time around was no exception.

This week I had to drive down to Boston to activate my TSA card for my career and was walking and driving down some of the streets I used to roam with The Legendary Kilowatt Bravo Number One Wild Indian himself, Chuck Fisk.

Imagine The Marlboro Man and a Young Indy wandering the streets, theaters, museums, coffee joints, and old book and record shops during the waning years of the Eighties, and you have some idea of the fun we had. My dad would read in the paper that there would be a late-night showing of one of our favorite movies somewhere in the city, then have to rush to the station to take the last train out to go home. Years later I came to this city many times with my then-girlfriend, now wife, and eventually our sons.

I have so many fond memories of this place. I'm excited that this one phase of my life is ending and another one is beginning so I can come back here again more often.

1fvwd5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1fvwd5d/at_will/,At Will,"Tom Wendell had always been ordinary.      
Quiet, unremarkable.       
He liked it that way. He moved through life without making ripples, blending into the background. Until one day, things started to change.       
It had started with small things. He didn't even remember exactly how small the things were he'd change. One thing was when he wanted the train to be on time. He was running late for work, standing on the busy, packed platform, anxiety tightening in his chest. He checked his watch, knowing he’d already missed it and would be too late.      
&nbsp;
       
But then, a flicker.      
&nbsp;
         
He, blinked and there was the train, gliding smoothly into the station as if it had always been on time. He stepped inside, confused but grateful.       
No one else seemed to notice anything strange. They shuffled on board, eyes glued to their phones, lost in their own worlds, oblivious to their unimportant surroundings.      
&nbsp;
         
At first, Tom thought nothing of it.      
Just luck, maybe. But it happened again.      
&nbsp;
          
The next time he was in line at a coffee shop, he wished the person in front of him would stop chatting with the barista and just leave.       
The thought barely formed in his mind before, blink,      
the person took their coffee and walked out, as if the entire conversation had never happened. Tom felt a rush, a weird thrill. He turned to look at the people around him, but they carried on like everything was normal.      
But he noticed something about their expressions that unsettled him.       
It was subtle, but every now and then, he’d catch a brief look of confusion, a fleeting moment where someone would furrow their brow, as if something didn’t quite add up. But just as quickly as the confusion appeared, it would fade, replaced with that glazed, passive look of someone going through the motions of their day.      
&nbsp;
          
It was déjà vu. That familiar, funny feeling that something had happened before but now, Tom realized, it was because, something had, no, it couldn't, he had changed it.      
&nbsp;
          
As weeks passed, Tom started to experiment. He’d shift the tiniest details. An awkward conversation at work could be rewritten in an instant, flash, and the words would come out smoothly. If he forgot to reply to an email, he’d just wish it had never arrived, blink, and it was gone, as though it had never been sent. Every alteration was seamless. No one noticed. No one, except for that brief flicker in some of their eyes, that momentary spark of confusion.      
&nbsp;
          
He started using it more. Bigger, bolder things. He found himself wanting more money in his bank account, half a second, there it was. A promotion at work? Bat of an eye. The recognition he’d always felt was just out of reach, was suddenly his. He just needed to take. Life was perfect.       
&nbsp;
          
But soon, he began to notice the cracks.      
&nbsp;
          
It started with his coworker, Sarah. One day, during a routine meeting, he wished she would stop talking so he could finish his point. It happened in an instant, Sarah’s words trailed off mid-sentence, and she sat back, letting him speak. Tom smirked, thinking nothing of it.      
&nbsp;
          
But when the meeting ended, he noticed something strange. Sarah sat at her desk, staring blankly at her computer screen. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, not moving. Her eyes were unfocused, distant. It was like she wasn’t fully there. He watched her for a moment, waiting for her to snap out of it. 
She didn’t.      
&nbsp;
          
Over the next few days, it got worse. Sarah began forgetting small things, her passwords, her own phone number, even where she parked her car, Once, she walked into the office with her shirt on inside-out and she didn’t even seem to notice. Tom wondered if it had anything to do with him, had he changed too much? Could he be pushing it too far?      
&nbsp;
          
But Sarah wasn’t the only one. More and more people around him started behaving strangely.       
A barista he had wished to be faster now moved like she was on autopilot, staring through him as if she were nothing more than a hollow shell. A neighbor he had changed to stop playing his music so loud had stopped playing music altogether and also stopped speaking, barely acknowledging his existence when they crossed paths.      
&nbsp;
          
It was as if each change of reality took something away, something subtle, but crucial.       
&nbsp;
          
Tom tried to slow down, to stop using his ability so carelessly, but the urge was always there, like a lingering thought. It was so easy, much too easy, to fix whatever annoyed him, to shape the world into exactly what he needed and wanted. Each time he altered something, it was like the world bent to his will and now, he saw there was a cost.      
&nbsp;
          
One night, Tom was sitting in his apartment, staring at his reflection in the darkened window. He thought back to the last time he had genuinely talked to someone, really talked, just hearing them out, listened to them, without changing anything. His life had become eerily quiet, like he was living in a script where everyone around him was acting out a role and this made him feel alone, even though nothing seemed out of place.      
&nbsp;
          
That’s when the knock came.      
&nbsp;
          
It was sharp, insistent.       
Three knocks.      
Tom stood up, heart pounding. No one visited him this late. He opened the door of his apartment and saw a man standing in the hallway. The man turned.
He was tall, dressed in an old-fashioned suit, and wore a hat.      
His face was pale, gaunt. Grey almost whit hair but his eyes were the worst part, dark and hollow, like they absorbed all the light around them.      
&nbsp;
          
The man smiled, a cold, thin smile.      
""Tom Wendell , I assume? My name is Mr Arlington.'      
He took a breath.      
“You’ve been meddling, haven’t you?” he asked, his voice low and unnervingly calm.      
&nbsp;
          
Tom froze. “I, I don’t know what you’re talking about.”      
&nbsp;
          
The man tilted his head slightly, his eyes sharpened their gaze, like a predator sizing up its prey. “You have felt it, haven’t you? The way things slip away. How people forget. How reality bends. You thought no one would or could notice, but I did. You see, the more you change things, the more cracks you leave behind.”      
&nbsp;
          
Tom’s mouth went dry. “What do you want?”      
&nbsp;
          
The man stepped closer. His shadow stretched unnaturally long behind him, flickering against the dim hallway light.      
&nbsp;
          
He slowly inhaled and exhaled, although somehow Tom was certain this, man, didn't have to inhale air.       
&nbsp;
          
“There’s a balance, Tom. A fragile, delicate balance. Every time you, twist, reality to fit your whims, you disrupt that balance and each time, it gets harder for the world to hold together. People like Sarah… they lose pieces of themselves. They lose pieces they’ll never get back.”      
&nbsp;
          
Tom’s heart raced. He backed away, his mind spinning. “I didn’t mean to...”      
&nbsp;
          
The man’s smile widened, but his eyes remained cold.       
“Intent, doesn’t matter. Only consequences do.”      
&nbsp;
          
Suddenly, Tom felt a pressure in his chest, like something was tightening around him. He looked down and saw his own shadow stutter, the same weird ripple he’d seen in others. He gasped, stumbling backward.       
&nbsp;
          
“No,” he muttered, “this can’t be happening.”      
&nbsp;
          
The man’s gaze was stern and darkened.       
“Oh, but it is. This, is the consequence. You have become part of the fabric, Tom. Each time you altered reality, you wove yourself deeper into it. You thought you were in control, but you were only borrowing from forces you don’t understand.”      
&nbsp;
          
He inhaled again and looked Tom straight in his eyes.      
""You changed things. Not only your own reality but you have thinkered with your own destiny, your own path and that of others.""      
He kept looking in his eyes and Tom heard a hint of sadness or at least thought he did.
""Changing someone's faith, Mr Wendell, changing their destiny or altering reality isn't up to your kind and is now in need of correction. That is the consequence.""      
&nbsp;
          
Tom felt his body grow heavier, his limbs sluggish. The apartment around him seemed to waver, like a half-forgotten dream. His reflection in the window blurred, shifting, as if he were becoming a part of the shadowy world he had manipulated.      
&nbsp;
          
“I can fix this, I can fix this,” he whispered,      
desperation seeping into his voice.       
“I can put everything back.”      
&nbsp;
          
The man’s smile faded. “There’s no going back. Not for you.”      
&nbsp;
          
And with that, Tom felt a sharp, cold snap. The world shifted again, but this time, it was different. The room felt distant, like a memory slipping away. He reached out to touch the wall, but his hand passed through it, his fingers dissolving into nothingness.      
&nbsp;
          
In the last moments before he vanished, Tom saw the man watching him, still smiling.       
The edges of the room rippled and folded, and Tom felt himself being pulled into the cracks he had created.      
&nbsp;

I'm really worried I've missed my chance to 'stand out'. Here's the blurb, if anyone can put me at my my ease/or confirm it's too similar, please tell me.

  
When a sky-pirate seeking a mysterious map attacks Evie Spicer, a young heiress, she hides in the dismal underworld of a war-torn city where the Damned, a community of machinery-infused cripples and malfunctioned automatons, fight to survive amid societal disdain. As a child of two warring nations, Evie’s mixed heritage has always marked her as an outcast, yet with the Damned, she discovers the possibility of belonging.

 

However, the world views the Damned as technological mistakes, and plans are in motion to eradicate them. Determined to save them, Evie operates a shady coffee den by day, smuggling the Damned out of the city by night. Her resolve pushed to the brink when her only link to salvation disappears and her means to rescue *the Damned* with it.

 

With a rising body count and a relentless Privateer on her trail, hope rekindles when an old friend proposes a daring heist: retrieve the legendary Map of Nought, rumoured to possess a power that might save the Damned. The twist? She must ally herself with Captain Metalwork, the very sky-pirate who once tried to kill her.

 

Flung into the deadly world of sky-piracy alongside four eccentric renegades, Evie races to find the map that could end an age of oppression… or ignite a new era of chaos.",0,1728039166.0,writing,1,0.5,False

About 10 months ago, I finally worked up the courage to ask her out for coffee, but she rejected me, saying, “I’ll let you know,” which I took as a polite no. I respected her decision and never acted out in any creepy way no calling, stalking, or bothering her. But despite that, it feels like she really dislikes me now, and it’s obvious in how she avoids me.

What’s been bothering me is that I actually admire her a lot. She’s very career focused, and our conversations were often about internships, jobs, and future plans, which I found attractive. We’re both on similar paths she’s starting her job while I’m finishing an internship that could lead to a full-time offer. But after the rejection, I noticed she treats me like I’m someone with no ambition or goals, which really stings because I’ve always tried to better myself.

Here’s where it gets complicated. Back in my first year, I went through a situation that really changed how I saw things. I was a class representative, and there was this incident where a group of girls in my class made some extremely inappropriate comments about a senior guy like, really disturbing stuff. When I tried to report it, the teachers brushed it off, saying that the guy “would enjoy it” because he’s a man. That whole experience opened my eyes to how men’s issues, especially regarding sexual harassment, can be dismissed, and it left me pretty scarred.

Because of that, I stopped trusting women for a while, and I kept my distance from everyone, including the girl I liked. But over time, she kind of restored my faith, and I started to see her differently. She’s driven, sweet, and although she’s a little selfish at times, she’s the kind of person I’m into. But I think she misunderstands me now, especially after I asked her out again and got the same “I’ll let you know” response. I understand it’s a rejection, but it feels like she views me as some creepy guy with no direction, which isn’t who I am at all.

The worst part is that the people who were involved in that earlier incident are still around her, and it’s hard to watch. She doesn’t know the kind of people they are, and it hurts to think she might think of me in the same way. After the rejection, I’ve stayed away, even removed her from social media, but I’ve been struggling with panic attacks, night terrors, and overwhelming anxiety. I’ve been going to therapy, but it hasn’t helped much.

Lately, I’ve been thinking about explaining all this to her. Not to change her mind or get back in her good graces, but just to clear the air and let her know why I was distant or awkward, and why I acted the way I did. I feel like telling her the truth could reduce some of my stress and maybe even clear up some misunderstandings. I don’t expect anything from her, but I also don’t want to accidentally hurt her by bringing all of this up.

So I guess my question is how would you feel if someone you rejected came back months later to explain themselves, not to win you over but just to give context and clear the air? Would that feel manipulative or intrusive, or would it bring some closure? I genuinely just want to regulate my emotions and move forward in a healthy way.

Thanks for reading, and I’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts, especially from women who might have experienced something similar. Should I keep this to myself, or do I owe it to her (and myself) to explain?

Since I had my daughter a year ago our sex life hasn’t been the same. I had complications postpartum so we couldn't have sex for almost 3 months. We discussed him taking care of himself. Since then we've had sex a handful of times, all initiated by me.

He then had a vascectomy and told me he had been testing everything works okay by himself first and making sure he's comfortable before we have sex. He said all good but it's been 2 months and we still haven't had sex. I've been more insecure now so I initiate more gently and he always has to work or finish something off.

His showers are often very long when he used to take 5 mins before my second child was born. He's ALWAYS on his phone and a few times I've noticed he's been engrossed with something on his phone and then later comes over to me and feels me up and kisses my neck and then disappears to go have a shower (long) before bed, I expect sex after but he actually goes to bed to sleep.

100% sure he's not having an affair.

I'm not unattractive either. I don't wear revealing clothing but I still get hit on all the time. A guy paid for my coffee and then gave me his number while I was pushing my baby in the stroller the other day! I'm also very sexually ""free"" let's say, which my husband knows so I'd literally try anything he wanted and I do most of the work when we do have sex. I think the only reason our sex life has stalled is because he prefers to get himself off to porn.",10,1728039045.0,Marriage,9,0.92,False

Greer surveyed the perp. He had a large gash on his forehead and a bandaged hand. 

‘I told you no rough stuff.’ 

‘He did it to himself. He dashed back through the automatic doors and wham. They didn’t open. First time I ever saw it.’ 

‘And his hand?' 

‘Larry from the K-9 unit was bringing his dog through booking, and the thing freaked. Took three officers to drag it off.’ 

Greer opened the interview room door. Instantly, the man jumped up. Greer reached for his sidearm, a warning. 

‘You gotta help me, man.’ 

‘You help me, and I help you.’ 

‘Make them go away.’ 

‘Who?’ 

He pointed at the glass of the two-way mirror, showing only Greer, his deputy and the gaunt perp. 

‘The damned!’

Greer sat, tapping his biro off his teeth as he checked the charge sheet. Theo Hermann- 23- 5,11- 130 pounds. Previous conviction for distribution of methamphetamine. Nothing about psychedelics. 

‘Nice and slow now. Tell us what happened.’

‘It started with the auction.’ 

…

Theo rarely had brainwaves, but this was a doozy. 

He hired an MC, a graphic designer, and set up a Facebook group. He even paid scraggly Mike to take care of parking. 

The auction. He’d sell every last item in the place. Cash money. 

The only problem being none of the stuff belonged to him. 

He’d been cutting Mrs Wallace’s grass since he’d gotten out of Castledyke. She was a friend of his mom’s through the church. 

She lived in what was called the Big House, back from the days when a widow who worked for the U.S. postal service could afford a place like that and fill it with shit. 

The brainwave: 

He announced Mrs Wallace had died during her yearly vacation to the Keys. Her estate was to be liquidated, her possessions walking their own way out, all the money in his back pocket. 

And like vultures sensing a good meal, they came from far and wide. Ornaments, pots, pans, paintings, jewellery, rugs. Anything that could be taken on the day was sold. 

Only one item made him pause- a pink mother-of-pearl vanity mirror. 

It was engraved in some weird script with a yellowed note tucked underneath. 

‘Upon sale of this mirror, the seller forgoes dominion over that which means the most to men.’ 

And Mrs Wallace had added in her own shaky hand. ‘Do not sell.’ 

Exactly what you’d write on the most valuable item in your house, Theo thought. 

He couldn’t remember who bought the mirror, but it sold, and then just as most of the bargain hunters had gone, disaster struck. 

Mrs Wallace’s taxi pulled up outside her emptied house- her vacation cut short by a hurricane warning. 

‘Theo?’ She said, recognising him even with his fake, Halloween beard. 

‘Mrs W… I can… Explain.’ 

She watched as her TV was carried through the front door, yet she didn’t stop its removal. Instead, all she muttered was 'the mirror.' 

Theo tried to spoon-feed her more bullshit as they went into the house, but she was only focused on that stupid mirror, pressing him again and again. 

‘What about the mirror?’ He burst out. ‘What have I lost?’

‘It’s obvious, dear,' she sighed, matter-of-factly. 'The thing that means the most to a person… Your soul. And they’ll be watching. Watching forever.’ 

…

A confession like that would hold up in court even with the mumbo jumbo mixed in, Greer thought. 

The deputy whispered in his ear that the boy’s mom had arrived. 

He figured it might calm him down to see her. 

Mrs Hermann was an old Mexican lady who wailed to the heavens at the sight of her son in handcuffs.

And then she thrust a crucifix in his direction. 

A melee. 

Theo took the necklace and then screamed as if it was flaming hot. 

The deputy was caught up in the flailing of arms and received a bust lip.

Semi-conscious, Theo covered his ears, screaming as he pointed at the two-way mirror. ‘Leave me alone! Please, God, I’ll do anything!’ 

…

Greer tipped a little whiskey into his machine coffee. The Super would want this written up.

He reviewed the tape, and there he was, 15 pounds heavier than he would’ve liked, with the deputy and Theo as the old lady was led in. 

He wrote something official sounding on his report: amphetamine-induced psychosis. 

And then the nib of his pen halted. The light in the mirror shown in the recording did not move right. It wasn’t reflecting the scene. 

He paused the video, zooming in. 

In the mirror was a grimacing man with red hair and a black halo above his head. 

Greer let the video run. 

The man was hanging by the neck, silver coins falling from his palm. He counted 30. 

Just then, the door opened; Greer almost jumped out of his weather-worn skin. 

‘I’m sorry, Sir,’ the deputy said. ‘You better come with me. The kid is dead. Suicide.' 

He glanced back to the screen where the visage of the man hung. 

‘You see that, son?’ He said to the deputy. 

The deputy squinted, and then his eyes opened wide. 

‘Is that Watkins? No, Watkins is on vacation. And there was nobody with us…’ He replied, scratching his beard. 

‘No, not Watkins. 

He wasn't a religious man, but an old childhood memory came to the fore. He crossed himself. ‘The damned.’ 

‘The damned?’

‘Iscariot.’ 

The deputy didn’t know what to say, so he slid into legalese. ‘Sir, you better come and confirm the time of death with the doctor.’ 

…

The boy was dead, no doubt. With some superhuman force, he’d smashed the laminated glass of the mirror in his cell and sliced himself up real good. 

Greer knelt, careful not to step in the pool of blood, ‘There are things worse than death.’

He’d said it to himself as much as anyone else, but it was the doctor who replied, snapping on a pair of latex gloves. ‘Yeah, my wife’s cooking.’ 

Greer ignored him, closing the boy's eyes and whispering. ‘I hope your sacrifice was enough to get back, well, you know what.’   

He stood, turned, and went on his way.  

However, the question remained, who had the mirror now? ",1,1728038968.0,originalloquat,0,1.0,False

So after a few months, nagka bind ako sa contract. And this year matatapos na siya.

for 6 months, okay naman siya kasi nagagawa mo pa talaga yung work mo which is to edit videos. pero dahil nagpakitang gilas ako (wag niyo gagawin to :( haha) ako na gumagawa lahat from script, shoot even conceptualize. Syempre kasama na diyan ang pag set up and tear down ng equipments. Even ako pa ang nag didirect ng videos. Masaya naman.

1fvw3ts,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1fvw3ts/how_i_cured_maybe_my_sibo/,How I cured (maybe?) my SIBO,"I'll try to keep it short. Suffered with horrific bloating for many years, was told I have iritable bowel syndrome (as you do) and after trying different things over and over again I finally heard about SIBO. Safe to say as my bloating was caused by random foods, I never really understood what is going on. So finally something like SIBO made sense. 

Researched SIBO as much as I could, to the point that I was not even sure it's a thing anymore (some claim it does not exist).

Took the plunge, paid for the test (UK NHS does not believe in SIBO so had to order online). Anyway, did the test and that thing they make you eat made me look like a ballon (so I was like, well this is a good sing, in a way) . Results came back, the SIBO was strong with me. To the point that the guys at the lab asked me a few times if I followed their diet precisely. I 100 percent did, wasn't gonna risk almost £200 just for 2 days of dieting (they only asked me for 1 day minimum, I decided to do 2, which is technically even better)

Reagrdless, I started doing an elimination diet to see if it works as I wasn't keen on antibiotics or other pills before trying all non-pills options. Started on only beef for like 2 weeks (that was the plan at least), because I heard that it's nutritious and bla bla. Fuck it, you gotta start somwhere and I said let's just do 1 ingredient. Well it took fucking 2,3 days for all bload to go away completely. It was so weird to not feel full after eating a normal portion.   
So I thought to myself after, maybe I'm just eating portions that are too large. So i tried eating until I was super full. Still fine. Actually more than fine, some joint pain dissapeared and I felt a bit more energy. Sleep was also definitely better. What wasn't better was my enjoyment of life cause eating only beef sucks. But whatever.  


Anyway, I became confident and started eating other stuff. Parmesan, eggs, feta - all foods low on carbs or any potential sugars as appareently with SIBO these bacteria fuckers love sweet stuff and that is what they eat and that;s what triggers them.   
Well, all was well. I even started eating some carbs now and again (but never as my first meal) like a pizza, and yeah, all was good.

  
Cracked after a few weeks and ate a tub of Ben and Jerry's. Like the whole tub. Things were still fine, I did not expect that. Well 2 days later, being a complete idiot, I ate another tube on Ben and Jerry's (both times in the evening). Next day, woke up, had food, went into super bloat again. 

Anyway, all in all it turns out if I starve these fuckers for a few days eating no sugars almost at all, they go away. Fasting alway works really well. And I can even have a bit if carbs (like pizza) but not too often. I can also have some cake (again, rarely) and won't have issues. When I start indulging , like having 2 tubs of ice cream in 3 days, or KFC 4 times in a week, the bloat comes back. But 2,3 days of eating nothing but beef, cheese (in general parmesan for me) and eggs, and I'm back to feeling great. Also, it's not just carbs, over indulging in potatoes seems to also get this going. 

I have no clue if I do have SIBO, or some intolarnces. But I can tell you how this all started. I never used to get bloated by anything. Until I got to Uni and started having shit coffee on an empty stomach, eat nothing but crap (pizza in general) and a lot of it, like 1 and a half large pizzas per meal. And I'm a pretty skinny guy. And I was also eating really fast and not chewing. Ended up with really bad acid reflux, went to the doctors and the idiot instead of just saying 'Yo, eat less crap, eat less in general and eat slowly' they put me on omneprazole. This helped, but after the treatment was over, acid reflux started again (because I was a stupid kid and did not change anyhting in my eating behavious) so I asked for omneprazol again. They gave me enough for 2 months . YOU ARE NEVER SUPPOSE TO TAKE IT FOR 2 MONTHS.   
Turns out, this shit drug messes up your stomach acid, which is also needed to kill bacteria in your intestine that shouldn't be there (saw somewhere that says that bacteria from your colon climb into your small intesting but stomach acidity kills them. In my case, the acidity was fucked).

All in all, I'm never bloated anymore unless I overindulge. And then, the bload that used to be there all the time and only want away rarely, well, I now know how to easily get rid of it. Just meat, or fast and good as new in a couple of days.

Anyway, again, no idea if I have SIBO, intolarances caused by omneprazol or whatever, but maybe I do have it. And maybe this will help someone. I've not cured it, but I can easily not be affected by it and can easily get rid of it when I messed up, and that was a huge change of life quality for me.

I wanted to know when my computers were on and I was at my desk so I could automate my lights and keep on the desk electronics. The HA Ping and Glances integrations weren't responsive enough, and the latter was also using too many CPU cycles for my liking, so I built this!

Key Features:

- 🔄 Reports when the PC is on

- 🛠️ Reports the result of any custom command (super useful to see, e.g. if you're connected to a specific USB peripheral, or if the hard drive space is lower than a certain percentage, etc.). I have some examples in the GitHub page.

- 🔌 Integrates with HA seamlessly

- 🚀 New in v0.2.0: Support for launchd and systemd so you can run it in the background

This tool has helped me save energy by automatically managing 3 speakers, a mixer, a monitor, lights, and various USB music peripherals by knowing when I'm actually at my desk using them.
