1o08sjv,https://gofund.me/9e07b8663,"I‚Äôve been diagnosed with a VERY RARE, Life-Threatening Genetic Disease. I was our family‚Äôs breadwinner, but my condition has left me unable to work. Now, I‚Äôve become a financial burden, and my illness has pushed us into deep debt. We‚Äôre struggling to afford even our basic needs. PLEASE HELP!!! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è","
Hi, my name is Rocheal I live in Oregon City, Oregon in the USA. I just got out of the hospital. yet again. 

Over the past two years, I‚Äôve been intubated 8 times. I've been in the hospital, every single month, if not twice a month, generally staying at least 3 days to a week or more, each time. 

All due to extreme swelling in my stomach, tongue, and throat. This swelling cuts off my airway which can cause asphyxiation instantly and death. Doctors initially believed, I was having severe allergic reactions, but none of the normal treatments for allergic reactions (Epi, Steroids, or Benadryl) had any effect.

After lots of gaslighting, from the doctors, and me constantly nagging for them to run more test. I was FINALLY diagnosed this year with a very rare, life-threatening genetic disease called HAE Type 3 which is the rarest form of this condition (Hereditary Angioedema with normal C1 estrase) this is a fairly new disease and thus far there are no medications specifically made to treat it.

The only life saving Medication available currently is Takhzyro (technically made to treat type 1 & 2) But has showed some success in helping about 30% of HAE type 3 sufferers. This medication costs OVER $20,000 per dose, and up to over $400,000 per dose and I need it every 2 weeks. Which is over $500k-$6 million dollars a year. BEYOND Crazy I know!. But they cant garentee it will work until I try it.

My insurance (Medicaid) has denied to pay this multiple times and rejected all appeals. Their reasoning is because its not 100% garenteed to work. They are requiring, I pay out of pocket, a 3 months supply. *6 doses* Once that's done, and I prove I have bought it, used it for the full 3 months, and show it actually worked by keeping me out of the hospital. Then and only then will they likely approve it, but it's still not garenteed.

Last November, I underwent brain surgery to remove a brain tumor on my motor cortex, which ended up being a meginonma. 

We tried to use a cheaper, medicine (For my HAE) Transmatic Acid and birth control which caused me to have, a submassive pulmonary embolism 

On top of that, I just found out at the start of September I am currently in right heart failure and my heart hasn't really been healing like they hoped since the clots were removed.

Unfortunately, with all of these serious health conditions. I am no longer allowed to work or drive. I went from the breadwinner proudly supporting my family. To being the one who has financially drained them and now we are drowning in debt.

It has gotten so bad weve had to sell our Livingroom furniture, our living room tv and bedroom tv, my coffee and end tables, our dining rooom set, my husband has sold his grill, most of his tools, our kids gaming systems, sport equipment, and my husband also donates plasma every chance he gets, I tried myself to donate but with my health Issues and all the medications they wont let me.

My husband is our only income source and provider, but he often misses a ton of work, at least 1-2 weeks a month. He has to be there during my hospitalizations, because when im intubated I cant make any of my own medical desisions so he's needing to be there at all times to be my voice. Opon my release He then has to be my care taker until I am strong enough to be left alone, but because of all the time he misses from work, we've fallen deep into debt.

We‚Äôre facing the threat of homelessness. We are struggling to afford basic needs like rent, food, utilities, and essentials for us and our two kids. I‚Äôve been denied by disability multiple times and I am currently appealing my last denial, but in the meantime, we need urgent help

I'd also really love to be able to pay for my medication for 3 months in hopes that it works to prove to the insurance company that It will help me if they approve it and get me through the insurance denials and appeal processes. (But with the price it's going to take a miracle)

The remainder would go to other monthly expenses such as gas for my husband to get back and forth to the hospital, and work, food, and other household, nessesities food is one of the highest priorities (we do utilize all our local food box options but many fall on dates or times my husband is at work or he's stuck at the hospital with me and cant leave) 

I want to thank anyone who took the time out of their busy day and  lives to read my post...(sorry it is so long) I want to thank anyone who is thinking of donating, and I want to thank anyone who actually donates it really means a lot to me and my family during this time... I also want to thank anyone who doesn't have the ability to donate but hits the upvote button, shares, and or takes the time to actually comment on this post because those small actions will help me get this post viewed...

again from the bottom of my heart Thank you... you all are appreciated! Have a great day! üôè‚ù§Ô∏è

In the past, my brother has bullied me and used my own vulnerability against me to make fun of me and humiliate me, and make me feel like my trauma isn't ""real"" trauma. And he would even do this IN FRONT of her, and she watched it happen with her own two eyes. I've even called out to her, saying, ""Mom, make him stop,"" and she just sat there silently and watched. Not helping me at all. Btw, my brother is 12 years older than me, so I couldn't defend myself against him because I'm so much younger than him, and he just looks at me as if I'm 8 years old. So I couldn't make him stop, and when I tried to get my mom to make him stop, she just sat there and watched silently, so I just had to endure it while sobbing.

This even happens to this day. The most recent experience was a month ago, my brother, my sister, (all older) visited my mom just to spend time with her, so my brother and I went up to the gas station to get drinks and some snacks/candy. When we got back from the gas station, and I took our drinks and snacks out of the bag, I walked into the living room, and my brother had grabbed the bag and put the bag over my head and kinda tugged, and it upset me, and I stumbled a bit and hit my knee on the coffee table pretty hard. and that rlly upset me because i knew he was gonna do that and beforehand i told him dont do that, and he still did. I was really upset by then, and he just laughed and called me dumb for hitting my knee and not watching where I was going. I just walked off to the guest bedroom (which was my old bedroom) and sat on the bed trying to calm down. But he came in there taunting me about it, and I told him to just get out, and he did surprisingly. But then he texted me in the family gc, mocking me for what I said. He said ""JuSt GeT OuT"" with a GIF mocking. And my mom was watching this all happen and did NOTHING. She knew about what he texted me because it was in the family gc. And not once did she defend me or make him apologize, but yk what she did do earlier in that day. She made me apologize to him for wacking the back of his head because he wouldn't get up and help me and my sister unpack groceries she had delivered to her house, and we kept asking him to help us, and he just ignored us while watching TV, and there were a lot of groceries. But I had to apologize to him for wacking the back of his head because he wouldn't help out.

I bought my Ninja Cafe Luxe ES601 3 days ago and having a little trouble dialling my beans correctly. 

They are fresh beans roasted 4 days ago from a local coffee website i‚Äôve used for years, so can‚Äôt really blame the bean, it‚Äôs a medium-dark though if this means anything? 

My weight is always 18g when i measure after grind so this is spot on, however, when i pull my shot, it lasts around 30-35 seconds AFTER the first drop, is this too long when taking the pre infusion of water coming through which is roughly 5 seconds? 

My strength is set at the middle, which is 1:2.5, so i should be getting around 45g of espresso but i‚Äôm getting close to 70g every time!

Taking the shot size and the time into consideration i thought i‚Äôd need to go finer? The machine is recommending 12, this morning I‚Äôve currently tried 9 and it‚Äôs still the same. I‚Äôve been reading the recommended size is only a GUIDE but going even lower than 3 under surely something is off?

I also thought, if i grind finer, would it take longer to come through but get less espresso, this is the bit thats confusing me. 

Thanks for any help!

Me and my ex wife were still in touch here and there throughout the divorce process then when it finalized around my birthday she told me she was already on the dating apps etc. I did not react well and felt hurt and she said it would be a good idea for us to not talk, she immediately started dating someone and when that didn't last very long she reached out to me again, we would meet up for coffee. But when I followed up with her she just avoided my calls and texts for months until finally she told me she didn't want to talk to me or see me, I asked if it was because she had a boyfriend she ultimately said yes. That was really tough and I haven't spoken to her since then that was almost a year ago at this point. 

It has gotten somewhat easier for me I have started thinking about dating but still can't quite get myself to do it, every now and then I see a photo of her with her boyfriend and my heart still sinks though it's gotten better, I'm in therapy I'm on medication which has helped for sure but yea I just can't seem to think that I'm ready to date again or someone would choose me I still feel damaged from the divorce. Does this ever get easier? I think about my ex wife much less these days but every once and I will still think about it  because of the lack of closure - she wasn't great with conflict or communication so that closure may never really exist. It hurts and I just want to move on and find a healthy relationship find someone I connect with because I want it not because I need it to feel better or not be alone.

I hailed a taxi in Luoyang, Dengfeng, Kaifeng, Chongqing and Yiwu / Hengdian Film Studios. I did not use DiDi via Alipay app, not once. I know its cheaper but I was happy to pay for the convenience. It was 35 degrees to 40 degrees every day, some days it reached 46 degrees humidity. At 8pm, it was 38 degrees. I didn‚Äôt want to wait around in the sun and heat for another 5min to save a few dollars when there was a taxi right in front of me. For my 1-month in China, I spent around $80 AUD on taxis which is I thought was incredible, especially if you compare to Australia taxi prices. I‚Äôve concluded that the extra money spent on hailing taxis ‚Äì instead of using DiDi, is to support the older generation who have trouble using or adjusting to technology, and some were very funny thus made the ride really memorable ‚Äì I communicated with them via translation apps.

I booked a private guide / driver for 2 days in Louyang / Dengfeng, 4 days in Zhangjiajie / Wulingyuan and 2 days in Chongqing. You can definitely travel around China without a private guide / driver but I want to relax, take a break from navigating, see as much as possible within a set time-frame, have someone take photos of me so I don‚Äôt have just pictures of my face to shoulders in every shot. If you want more information about the guides / drivers that I used, DM me. For price reference, its roughly 600 yuan ‚Äì 900 yuan per day for an English speaking guide, this will depend on the city / province and where you want to go / see / do, it doesn‚Äôt including transportation, the type of car / size, your meals or attraction entrance tickets. It will also depend on your group size as well.

About food, I had a list and didn‚Äôt end up at any of the restaurants or cafes that I noted down. As it was so hot and humid, I didn‚Äôt eat much. I ate whenever or wherever it was convenient since my priority was sightseeing. I did keep an eye out for ice cream and drinks to help me deal with the weather. I usually ate x3 different types of ice cream, every day ‚Äì on a stick in a plastic wrapper, not in a cup ‚Äì I tried as many fruit flavours as I could and enjoyed them all!

Average cost for food / drinks:
# Noodle soup or rice based dish = 10 yuan to 20 yuan, depends on what time of meat is included.. beef is most expensive
# McDonald's, medium big mac meal = 50 yuan
# 500ml bottle of water = 1 yuan at a supermarket to 5 yuan at a tourist attraction site
# Mixue drinks = 5 yuan to 10 yuan per cup depending on the flavour, toppings etc
# Luckin Coffee = 10 yuan for the first cup of the day, also depends on the flavour. I miss Luckin Coffee!
# Ice cream on a stick in a plastic wrapper, not scooped into a cup = 3 yuan to 10 yuan, depending on flavour / brand
# Cultural heritage ice cream, only available at main tourist attractions = 20 yuan to 25 yuan
# Fruit = prices varied a lot but cheaper at wet markets, street vendors, night markets compared to supermarkets, malls or fruit & vege stores. I paid 10 yuan for 4 bananas, 20 yuan for punnet of blueberries, 10 yuan for pre-cut watermelon and mangoes put in clear plastic container (half a shoe-box size).

Cost of some items:
# CCC labelled 10,000 MaH power-bank with USB cords attached, 69 yuan from Miniso
# PopMart blind boxes are 69 yuan each, roughly 30% cheaper in China ‚Äì compared to Australia.
# ‚ÄúFake‚Äù labubu plush toys are 15 yuan for the plain coloured ones, and 25 yuan for the dragon looking one ‚Äì wings and tail. Buy from the street sellers around China. I didn‚Äôt see any in the PopMart stores...
# embroidered round fans with a wooden handle are 10 yuan in Luoyang, 20 yuan to 30 yuan everywhere else in China LOL
# ceramic tea cup ‚Äì with floral art, pictures, writing etc were 5 yuan each in Fenghuang ancient town, the cheapest that I saw
# canvas fabric tote bags are 10 yuan to 60 yuan depending on design
# Hello Kitty 0.5mm mechanical pencil, 6 yuan from a stationery shop in a mall, prices vary a lot for stationery though
# souvenir magnets, 5 yuan in Chongqing, 10 yuan+ everywhere else
# folding paper fans, 5 yuan in Chongqing, 10 yuan+ everywhere else
# traditional wooden carved hairpin, with dangling flowers or charms were 10 yuan each, cheapest in Luoyang, other cities sold the same item for 30 yuan+

With accommodation, everyone has different budgets and needs. I just wanted a clean place to sleep, my own bathroom with standing shower and sit-down toilet (not squat toilet), and a TV because I like having some background noise and a break from using my mobile phone. On average, I paid about $40 AUD per night for a hotel room in China, some included an asian style breakfast. All had free laundry and most had helpful staff ‚Äì they washed/dried my clothes and delivered it to my room. I reached out to all my hotels via WeChat to confirm my booking and to ask questions. They also preferred it that way too. I always choose a location that‚Äôs central to many tourist attractions ‚Äì within 30min walk is good, 5min-10min walk to a metro station and ideally 30min taxi ride to the long-distance train station.

I found it really interesting that 9/10 hotel rooms in China, you need x2 remote controls to watch TV. I had to get staff to help show me how to turn on the TV HAHA and some are voice-activated like with a google home device. I always travel my movies & TV shows on a USB to watch on the hotel room TV but in China, the way the TV is positioned, I couldn‚Äôt access the USB port or the system did not allow USB access. Whereas, in Japan, I was able to use my USB at 9/10 hotel rooms.

There are robots to deliver you food to your hotel room but I only experienced it at the Kaifeng hotel as this hotel provided 10pm-12am snacks. I told the reception staff when I returned from my sightseeing for the day, what I wanted and the robot came to my hotel room around 10.30pm every night. I didn‚Äôt use the meituan app or any food delivery app because I was out of my hotel for breakfast and came back after dinner ‚Äì there was no need for the food delivery, for me. There is so much food and food choice in China, I will be really shocked if I read some day that a tourist died, had starved to death, in China!

Now for the itinerary, it will be on another post.
If you want to know more about a specific attraction, please ask.
Thanks for reading and for your time. Hope you all enjoy China as much as I did!

1o08m4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/traumatizeThemBack/comments/1o08m4j/the_linkedin_credit_roll/,The LinkedIn Credit Roll,"A few months ago, I wrapped up one of the biggest projects my team had ever handled. I stayed up late for weeks, fixing bugs, writing documentation, even training the new hires who were supposed to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù but mostly watched me do the heavy lifting. It wasn‚Äôt glamorous, but I was proud of what we built.

Then, the week after launch, I opened LinkedIn and saw my manager‚Äôs post. There it was: *‚ÄúSo proud of MY team for delivering this incredible product under my leadership!‚Äù* followed by a long list of hashtags and a photo of him smiling like he‚Äôd just cured cancer. Guess whose name wasn‚Äôt mentioned anywhere?

I just stared at the screen. My coffee went cold while I scrolled through the comments, people congratulating him, calling him a ‚Äúvisionary leader,‚Äù and tagging other managers. Not a single person even knew I existed. That was the day I realized: I was working for someone who would take the spotlight and leave me in the dark every time.

So I played the long game. Over the next few weeks, I quietly started collecting receipts, emails, version histories, commit logs, screenshots of Slack messages where *I* was the one solving the major issues. I didn‚Äôt say a word.

When our company‚Äôs internal newsletter asked for a ‚Äúteam success story,‚Äù I volunteered to write it. I kept it professional, no names, no shade. Just a detailed breakdown of the process, highlighting collaboration, problem-solving, and individual contributions. Of course, I mentioned everyone‚Äôs role accurately. By the time it was published, it was pretty clear who had actually done the work.

And then I did something extra. On LinkedIn, I made my own post:

The lab was buzzing last night, not with alarms, but with the steady hum of machinery, the hiss of the kettle, and the faint jitter of too much caffeine. Break-time had turned into a caffeine drinking game, and somewhere between sips and muttered theories, the crew dove into the oddities of a very peculiar OG Xbox.

From the moment it powered on, the beast threw Error 09 ‚Äî HDD failure. A deep dive revealed a mis-set pin on the hard drive, a detail so strange it made the crew tilt their heads in disbelief. The console was factory-sealed ‚Äî screws untouched, stickers pristine. How could it be? Microsoft wouldn‚Äôt ship a unit like this. And yet‚Ä¶ here it was, mocking them silently.

Adding another layer to the mystery, this Xbox runs on a v1.6 motherboard, released in November 2004. It should have had the latest dashboard baked in, fully updated and ready for action. Instead, it spat out Error 21 ‚Äî dashboard failure. A console this late in the production line failing like this? The crew exchanged knowing glances ‚Äî something about this unit just didn‚Äôt add up.

Error Dossier:

Error 09 (HDD failure): Usually triggered by faulty hard drives or misaligned pins. In this case, a single rogue pin in a factory-sealed console was enough to fry the system‚Äôs patience.

Error 21 (Dashboard failure): A refusal to load the dashboard, typically caused by corrupted system software or outdated dashboards. But for a v1.6 board, this is like receiving a birthday cake that‚Äôs already burned ‚Äî it shouldn‚Äôt happen.


Speculations flew across the lab like sparks: hardware anomaly? Factory fluke? Quantum glitch in the Xbox continuum? No theory was too wild.

The kettle whistled. The coffee mugs clinked. The hum of the lab continued as the crew scribbled notes, jotted down hypotheses, and prepared for the next round of digital surgery. If they dropped 50p for every cup of coffee brewed during these late-night sessions, they could probably fund a full repair of the coffee machine itself ‚Äî a small, practical reward for all this caffeinated chaos.

This isn‚Äôt just an Xbox. This is a puzzle, a challenge, a midnight obsession. And the Insomnia Labs crew? They‚Äôre not walking away until they‚Äôve solved it.

Stay caffeinated. Stay tuned. ‚ö°",1,1759823833.0,Insomnia_Labs,0,1.0,False

I agreed and I gave him a heads up prior and told him that I will be dressed super casual-legging, sweat shirt and uggs; since I was leaving a nail appointment. As I arrived at the mall, I asked for his location-he told me exactly where he was at and directed me to him. As I walked towards him, he quickly walked off to my opposite direction, behind a massive pole went up the stairs and vanished. Soon after, blocking me on everything without any explanation. 
Three years later, he ‚Äúliked‚Äù me on a dating app looking drastically older and hideous-balding and heavier. At first I denied it because he looked disgusting but then I thought what if I did the same to him.
How much of a fool does need to be to not remember me or what he did to me. (We are both from a distinctive background)
He asked for my number, I provided him with a fake number to text me on and blocked him on the dating app. I‚Äôve been casually chatting with him, tweaking a few details here and there for him to not suddenly remember who I am but I am planning on scheduling a date with him, just to not show up and blocking him without any explanation-like what he did to me.

I (28) just realized that I have been watching my parents relationship slowly break down for 20 years‚Ä¶recently the fracture between them has been awful. I don‚Äôt know how to navigate this as I always believed they were the perfect couple. My science mind feels the need to rationalize and dissect this situation to help create understanding and closure for myselfü§∑

Before we begin, please understand that we come from a brown, religious culture so things may be different than what the average white suburban family deals with.

Parent 1 is the breadwinner, and has valid standards for the way they want to live, including living in a clean environment (bed is made everyday, counters don‚Äôt have too much clutter, pet fur isn‚Äôt overwhelming our respiratory systems, etc). Parent 1 contributes to the house with chores, finances, cooking, running errands, and even forgoes time off to allow parent 2 and kids to go on vacay (we have many animals and a pet sitter isn‚Äôt an option). Parent 1 works 6 days a week at relatively stressful environment. Parent 1 nags a lot, and although this is annoying at times, they are the kind of person that feels the need to speak how they feel or else they will feel emotionally repressed. Because of this, we let them vent‚Ä¶a LOT.

Parent 2 has not financially contributed while in this relationship, and has contributed in other ways such as chores, running errands, taking care of all doctors appointments/meds for Parent 1, and raising 3 kids (not easy bc my brother was an undiagnosed nightmare to raise). Parent 2 is stubborn and messy, and will blatantly refuse to do something if asked twice. It‚Äôs a trigger point relating to their own childhood trauma, and this includes emotional repression (not excusing it). They also have rampant ADHD and mild OCD.

Parent 2 simply doesn‚Äôt do anything that Parent 1 asks, while Parent 1 won‚Äôt hesitate to do what Parent 2 asks. For example, Parent 1 wants to go to bed at the same time around 11. Parent 2 will stay on the couch till 2am playing mindless games on their phone or scrolling through reels. I have literally walked in on Parent 2 at 2am slouched so far down the couch that they were essentially leaning against the floor, and I‚Äôve literally dragged them to bed. Parent 1 has said to Parent 2 ‚Äúyour phone is your new spouse!‚Äù. This is important to Parent 1 as morning coffee is the time they spend together talking, but now Parent 2 sleeps in for hours and they no longer drink coffee together. Parent 2 will stay on the couch for 6-12 hours a day, only getting up when they hear that Parent 1 got home. Then Parent 2 will quickly do the dishes or make the bed as if making up for lost time. Parent 1 complains that Parent 2 must be doing this on purpose to avoid spending time with them. Parent 2 actively avoids confrontation and will sit alone for hours upon hours before realizing they have a child to speak to.

Enter my sibling (24 year old child)‚Ä¶doesn‚Äôt work, has refused to learn how to drive until a month ago, loves to stir drama and rumors yet somehow never has credible information. This sibling is extremely close to Parent 2 and villainizes and blames Parent 1 for every issue they‚Äôve ever had. Why? Bc Parent 1 told them when they were 14 that they didn‚Äôt think SSRI‚Äôs at 14 are a good idea. Since then, sibling thinks Parent 1 is praying on their downfall. Sibling also insists that everything they want must happen, how they want it and when they want it. Sibling will either guilt trip you or complain so much that you‚Äôll want to end it all if you don‚Äôt do what they want.

Today things reached a point. An incident occurred in which there was a slight miscommunication between my parents. While Parent 1 was still confused, they vented about the situation to sibling. Rather than quelling the fire and figure out what happened, sibling ran with the rumor mill and began acting like a condescending reality tv star. I arrived at this point, to which sibling said to me ‚Äúsooo‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not my story to tell but you almost got parent 1 kicked out of public place‚Äù to which I immediately became confused bc I hadn‚Äôt done any such thing so I turned to parent 1 and said ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs going on??‚Äù and parent 1 said this wasn‚Äôt a big deal and to forget about. I became upset because I want to take accountability if I did something and correct it. Sibling was watching this exchange and smirking as if they were enjoying it. Parent 2, who knew the truth, was a silent deer in headlights onlooker. A few hours later, sibling assumed that Parent 1 LIED to them about the story and accused them of being a liar (if you‚Äôre brown you also know how bad this is in our culture).

Once the miscommunication was cleared up later in the evening, Parent 1 accused of Parent 2 of only doing what sibling wants and not caring about them. Parent 1 stated they were tired of sibling accusing them of wrongdoing while Parent 2 watched. Parent 1 said parent 2 never taught sibling better behavior.

I‚Äôve had it with both of them and sibling. Parent 1 refuses to admit that Parent 2 will never change. Parent 2 refuses to admit that they could do more to make their marriage work.

There‚Äôs no cheating, drinking, or drug use involved here so please don‚Äôt use that as the cause of the problems.

I work full time in healthcare, my job is incredibly stressful. I just wanna believe in love again. I just want to believe my parents will be there for each other when they get older. Idk what to feel anymore other than disappointment.",2,1759823642.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False
1o08jqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/comments/1o08jqh/disclosure_work/,Disclosure work,"It's been sometime since I last posted, being in this place where as much progress we make, it doesn't change.

It's been 18 months since DDay1, we maintain the weekly check in. The last DDay was in March (1 year anniversary of DDay1) where WS finally admitted to sleeping with AP1 multiple times in 1 night, then deciding to end it. The night she admitted it, i asked for a full written disclosure. 

It took 15 months from DDay1 for WS to pick up a book and read it on her own. That was in June, I thought she had turned a corner but she didn't pick it up again during the next week, where every day I would get agitated hearing the videos she would play on her phone instead. 

We argue and after it's calmed down, i tell her i don't need her to spend every waking second working on herself, just do something consistently. 

Since then, I've told her multiple times, I don't know how much longer I can do this. I've realised that I just may not get a full disclosure, if it were to end i would be ok with knowing what i already know, and walking away. 

A couple of weeks week ago, she started on the full disclosure, wrote a paragraph and didn't touch it again until our check in this weekend. It's the reading thing all over again. 

She's avoidant, I get it. When she starts, it's like sticking your hand in ice water, but worse because the shame starts to build. I ask is there anything I can do to make that easier.. no. 

The last week I'm exhausted, I realised that it's getting close to the anniversary of my daughter passing, so that's probably part of it. But we talk and I say again, I don't know how much longer I can go on with this, every day, week, month of not knowing whatever it is you're struggling with putting down on paper. It's a burden that I'm carrying. 

WS's fear of writing full disclosure, with all the shame and emotion of going over it again, is more/bigger than the fear of losing me. 

Maybe the explanation helped, I don't know. But she picks up the pen and starts writing. 

She started writing about AP1, which was the last DDay, how it started. She told me in March they met for coffee, escalated to exchanging photos and sexting, it was on and off for 7 months before she met him at a hotel and they had sex multiple times, no protection. 

She disclosed that they had spoken on the phone frequently (new information), he had wanted to kiss her when they met for coffee right at the very beginning. 

We talked about what she wrote, she realised it was an EA which became a PA. I think she minimised the hell out of what it was, until she write it down. 

My desire for R, the energy or will power, started high.  18 months ago I could see the path, IC and MC, working through our stuff and improving the communication, working on being vulnerable. 

Now, I'm exhausted. I'm working on me, doing stuff I want to do. The path I'm on is more around being alone again. Preparing for the end i guess. 

WS described what she was doing as focusing on the small wins, not looking at the calendar. She's committed to 2 nights a week, adding details.

I didn't intend on reading what she disclosed straight away. But it felt like it was a positive thing, reassuring that the info she had given wasn't blowing up the relationship.

I'm open to any advice, I was going to ask about the disclosure process (wait and read in 1 go vs reading bits at a time) but WS has a reluctance to write so i think I'll just ask her what is going to make her feel safer.

I (19M) had an interest in a woman (23F) in the same course as me. For two months, we were in the same assigned study group. As the group was dissolving, I thought I'd see if there was a spark. My thinking was that if not, I'd at least make a good friend, so I invited her for coffee over text. I didn't intend for it to be a date, more of a quick, low-stakes hangout. She agreed but said she was going on holiday and would let me know when she was back. I told her I was looking forward to seeing her and that we could organise it afterwards.

She never got back to me after the week-long break. The morning our course started again, she just reacted to my original message with a thumbs-up, and that was it. I immediately knew she wasn't interested, so I didn't mention it again. I still see her around in some classes and we exchange small talk;  I definitely didn't want things to be awkward. I was confused and would be lying if I said I was not hurt a bit. Why she initially agreed then never followed up bugged me. From my perspective, you wouldn't treat a friend like that.

A month and a half later, I was sitting at lunch with a friend of hers when she joined us. She had mentioned planning a trip for the weekend, so I asked how it was. She said it was too difficult to organise, so she dropped the idea. She then mentioned that she and her friend had planned on grinding out coursework over the weekend, but that didn't happen either. As a slight jab, I said with a smile and a laugh:

""You keep making plans and promises then not keeping them.""

I just meant it as a little jab about what she had just said. To be honest, the texting incident wasn't on my mind, but maybe it was subconsciously. She laughed for a split second, but then it got quiet between her and her friend. The realisation of how it must have sounded hit me, and I just stayed silent. I regretted it the moment I realised it. The conversation eventually restarted, and I guess we all just pretended nothing happened.

I honestly felt sick to my stomach. I really don't want it to seem like I hold a grudge. I'm just worried this comment made it look like I dislike her.

Ok‚Ä¶ so after another caffeine-fueled all-nighter, the lab crew are still at it ‚Äî eyes red, hands steady, determination unshaken. The mission: fix the cursed dashboard error on the OG Xbox.

They‚Äôve run every recovery route known to humankind ‚Äî from softmods to Hail Mary file rebuilds ‚Äî but the beast refuses to boot. The head tech hasn‚Äôt slept yet and just muttered, ‚ÄúSleep‚Äôs optional, progress isn‚Äôt.‚Äù

When Plans A through E crumble in smoke and static, the lab moves to the unspoken fallback: Plan X ‚Äî full surgical intervention. The beast is getting chipped. No more half-measures. The hope is to bring it back stronger, cleaner, and maybe even ready for some experimental upgrades once it‚Äôs alive again.

The lab‚Äôs prepping for the operation now ‚Äî tools laid out like instruments of digital resurrection. The hum of fans and the constant rattle of coffee mugs echo through the room. The kettle‚Äôs working harder than the engineers.

If they dropped 50p in a jar for every cup brewed tonight, they could probably afford to fix the coffee machine too.

Stay tuned. Surgery begins soon. ‚ö°

So are common cold and cardiomyopathy 

These two have various aetiologies and manifestations 

What if addiction does too? 

What if you can be addicted not only to narcotics, alcohol, gambling but also -

Addicted to melancholy , 

Because in some weird twisted way it makes you feel special 

Addicted to expectations,

Because love brings a lot of it- but it means you have love! 

Addicted to dependency ,

Because you are too scared to face the truth alone so you surround yourself with people or entities

Addicted to the incessant longing for life to have meaning ,

Because you like hide and seek

Addicted to self improvement ,

Because you believe there‚Äôs a better you inside the you that you are, who is going to make you better 

Addicted to drama,

Because you are SO important 

So what‚Äôs the first step? Isn‚Äôt it accepting the fact? 
But where are the meetings?
 where you can say - Hello I am addicted to self improvement in such a way that I want to grow but also accept myself and the world. 

And someone else says- Hello I am addicted to the need to feel special all the time in such a way that deep down I know we all are just the same- beautiful and broken. 


And then we hope together, over cookies and coffees-  to have the serenity to accept the things we cannot change, the courage to change the things we can, and the wisdom to know the difference.

1o086gb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ausjobs/comments/1o086gb/need_advice_on_breaking_out_of_my_silent_and/,Need Advice on Breaking Out of My Silent and Nervous Shell at Work - Feeling Invisible and Disrespected,"Been working at a medium-sized, well-known Australian corporation for about five months now, and I‚Äôm really struggling with the social and communication dynamics here.

When I joined, I was extremely nervous because I didn‚Äôt know much about the industry and felt totally out of my depth. Kept quiet in meetings and conversations, thinking it was better to stay silent than say something wrong. But over time, I‚Äôve found that my silence has kind of become a pattern, and now, I feel like I've lost my voice entirely.

The thing is, I‚Äôm now the last person anyone listens to when I speak in meetings/lunch banters/coffee catch ups etc. In fact, most of what I say just gets lost in the noise. It‚Äôs a bit worse outside of formal work settings too; whenever there are lunch breaks or coffee chats, I try to join in, but when I start speaking, the conversation feels one sided and I feel no one likes to engage with me. To be precise, no one counters or follows up on anything I say, even if I try to add to the banter. I‚Äôm also not invited to any team lunches or coffee breaks, and I‚Äôve become pretty much a loner at this point.

What‚Äôs even more frustrating is that, despite me trying to network and connect with them, I‚Äôm constantly shot down. I feel like my timid mannerisms (which I‚Äôm sure are a result of my anxiety) have formed a kind of image of me that people just seem to stick with. I get the sense that no one wants to invest in a conversation with me because they already think they know who I am: quiet, shy, and awkward.

This has created a situation where I‚Äôm constantly nervous at work, especially when I need to discuss something critical or make a point in a meeting. I‚Äôve tried speaking up, but it always feels like I‚Äôm either ignored or shut down right away. I often just keep to myself, which only reinforces the cycle.

This is not who I want to be. I‚Äôm naturally an extrovert and I know I can contribute to the team, but I‚Äôm stuck in this cycle of feeling invisible. I really want to change this dynamic, but I‚Äôm not sure how to break out of this shell.

Has anyone been through something similar? How can I start being more visible at work and rebuild my confidence? I‚Äôd appreciate any advice or strategies you have for getting noticed and overcoming this self-doubt!",2,1759822148.0,ausjobs,0,1.0,False

 Chapter 1

**Madison**

¬†

I lifted my gaze from the computer screen as the elevator dinged. A woman in a red dress strutted toward me, her heels clicking against the marble floor like a timer counting down to chaos.

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to see Alexander.‚Äù She planted her manicured hands on my desk, leaning forward with a smile that didn‚Äôt reach her eyes.

‚ÄúDo you have an appointment?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need one. We have‚Ä¶ history. Just tell Shim Vanessa‚Äôs here.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but Mr. Knight only takes scheduled appointments. I can help you set one up for next week-‚Äù

‚ÄúListen here, little secretary.‚Äù She interrupted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Vanessa Caldwell. I spent the night with Alexander last weekend, and I‚Äôm not leaving until I see him.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs I mentioned, without an appointment or express permission from Mr. Knight-‚Äù

‚ÄúWho do you think you are? Just because you stand next to him all day, fetching his coffee and taking notes, you think you‚Äôre special?‚Äù

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, I need to ask you to leave-‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pathetic. Playing gatekeeper, pretending you matter. I bet you fantasize about him noticing you, don‚Äôt you? Honey, even if you spread those thighs on his desk, he wouldn‚Äôt give you a second glance. He needs a real woman, not some desperate little assistant playing dress-up in her Target blazer.‚Äù

‚ÄúSecurity will escort you out if necessary.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt dare. Do you know who my father is? I could have your job with one phone call.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd I could remove you from the premises with one button.‚Äù I placed my hand near the security alert under my desk. ‚ÄúYour choice, Ms. Caldwell.‚Äù

Vanessa‚Äôs face contorted with rage. In one fluid motion, she snatched the water pitcher from my desk and emptied its contents over my head. Ice-cold water drenched my hair, makeup, and brand-new blouse ‚Äì for the record, it wasn‚Äôt from Target.

‚ÄúOops.‚Äù She smirked, dropping the empty pitcher on my keyboard with a clatter. ‚ÄúLooks like someone needs a towel.‚Äù

But before I could process my next move, the elevator dinged again.

Alexander Knight stepped out, filling the lobby like a storm front. His easy stride faltered as he took in the scene ‚Äì me looking like a drowned rat, Vanessa preening like a cat who‚Äôd gotten the cream, and water pooling across my desk and expensive electronics.

‚ÄúWell.‚Äù His voice cut through the tension. ‚ÄúThis is certainly not the greeting I expected.‚Äù

Vanessa‚Äôs face lit up. ‚ÄúAlexander, darling! I was just-‚Äù

‚ÄúAssaulting my PA and damaging company property?‚Äù He crossed to us in three strides. ‚ÄúBold strategy.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was simply having a conversation with your PA.‚Äù Her voice dripped honey while her eyes stabbed mine. ‚ÄúShe refused to let me see you.‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause that‚Äôs her job.‚Äù Alexander handed me his monogrammed handkerchief. His touch sent an unwanted tingle up my arm. ‚ÄúMiss Harper follows my protocols to the letter. That‚Äôs why she‚Äôs invaluable.‚Äù

I dabbed at my face, grateful I‚Äôd worn waterproof mascara today. The handkerchief smelled like his cologne ‚Äì a detail I wasn‚Äôt focusing on.

‚ÄúBut darling,‚Äù Vanessa stepped closer to Alexander, her hip swaying. ‚ÄúAfter our magical night together-‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean the charity gala where you had too much champagne, and I called you a cab? That was hardly magical, though I hear you‚Äôve been telling a different version around town.‚Äù

I bit my lip to hide my smile.

‚ÄúI-‚Äù Vanessa gaped like a fish.

‚ÄúNow,‚Äù Alexander‚Äôs hand came to rest on my shoulder, and I prayed he couldn‚Äôt feel how my pulse jumped. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve just assaulted my favorite employee and probably destroyed about ten thousand dollars worth of equipment. Would you like me to call security or the cops?‚Äù

I felt my cheeks heat at my ‚Äòfavorite employee.‚Äô He was always like this‚Äîcharming, flirtatious, and making everyone feel special. It didn‚Äôt mean anything.

‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt dare.‚Äù But Vanessa‚Äôs confidence wavered.

‚ÄúTry me. I protect my people, especially those who keep my life running smoothly. In fact, I should ban you from the building entirely. What do you think, Miss Harper?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think that sounds reasonable, Mr. Knight.‚Äù I stayed professional despite his touch warming me.

Vanessa‚Äôs face cycled through fifty shades of red. ‚ÄúThis is ridiculous. You‚Äôll regret this. Both of you will.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe only thing I regret is not having my phone out to record this tantrum. Security‚Äôs on their way up. I suggest you leave before they arrive.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy father will hear about this!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure he will. Give Charles my regards. Tell him his company‚Äôs stock is looking shaky these days.‚Äù

As soon as the elevator doors closed on her scowling face, Alexander‚Äôs hand left my shoulder, and I immediately missed its warmth ‚Äì a thought I quickly shoved into my brain‚Äôs ‚Äòdo not examine‚Äô folder.

I stood from my chair, water dripping onto the floor.

‚ÄúAre you alright?‚Äù Alexander‚Äôs brow furrowed as he assessed the damage. ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt hurt you, did she?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust my pride. And maybe my electronics.‚Äù I poked at my waterlogged keyboard, which responded with an alarming spark.

‚ÄúLeave that. I‚Äôll have IT bring up replacements.‚Äù He pulled out his phone. ‚ÄúJohn can get you to the mall in fifteen minutes. Use the company card to pick up whatever you need‚Äîclothes, makeup, hair products.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, Mr. Knight, but it‚Äôs no big deal. My shift ends in an hour, and I have a prior engagement after work.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to sit in wet clothes for another hour?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll manage,‚Äù I insisted with a smile. ‚ÄúBut I appreciate the offer.‚Äù

He gave me a look that said he didn‚Äôt believe me but nodded anyway.

¬†

I pushed open the door to the restaurant, ready for a relaxing dinner with Hazel after my disaster of a day. The hostess led me toward our usual corner booth, but I stopped short. Instead of just my best friend, a man sat beside her.

¬†

‚ÄúMads!‚Äù Hazel bounced up, waving like I might miss her in the half-empty restaurant. ‚ÄúYou made it! Come meet Derek!‚Äù

I forced a smile and sat across from them. Of course, Hazel would ambush me with a surprise blind date after the day I‚Äôd had.

‚ÄúMads, this is Derek. He‚Äôs a financial analyst, and I met him at that yoga retreat last month.‚Äù Hazel‚Äôs eyes sparkled with matchmaking glee. ‚ÄúDerek, meet my best friend Madison.‚Äù

‚ÄúPleasure.‚Äù Derek flashed perfectly whitened teeth. ‚ÄúHazel told me so much about you.‚Äù

I resisted the urge to kick Hazel under the table. ‚ÄúAll good things, I hope?‚Äù

We fumbled through awkward small talk about the weather and restaurant specials until Derek excused himself to the restroom.

The moment he was out of earshot, Hazel pounced. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt he dreamy? Those shoulders! And he‚Äôs so successful ‚Äì you should see his condo downtown.‚Äù

‚ÄúHaze‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, when did you last go on a real date? You work too hard, sweetie. Everyone needs someone to lean on.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine on my own right now. With Mom‚Äôs treatments and everything‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHow is she doing?‚Äù Hazel‚Äôs expression softened.

‚ÄúThe same. The new medication is expensive, but‚Ä¶‚Äù I shrugged.

‚ÄúAnd that brother of yours is still MIA?‚Äù Hazel‚Äôs face darkened. ‚ÄúWhat a selfish asshole, leaving you to handle everything alone.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk about him. Mom worked three jobs to raise us. The least I can do is help her now.‚Äù

Derek slid back into the booth, adjusting his designer tie. ‚ÄúSorry about that. Now, where were we?‚Äù

‚ÄúMadison was just telling us about her day at work,‚Äù Hazel chirped.

‚ÄúOh, right ‚Äì you work as a secretary or something?‚Äù Derek asked.

‚ÄúPersonal assistant to Alexander Knight at Knight Industries.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlexander Knight? The CEO?‚Äù He leaned forward, elbows on the table. ‚ÄúMust be quite the‚Ä¶ demanding position.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, we all know how these things work.‚Äù He winked. ‚ÄúBeautiful young woman, powerful executive‚ÄîI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve found ways to make yourself invaluable to the company.‚Äù

Hazel‚Äôs jaw dropped. ‚ÄúDerek!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? I‚Äôm just saying what everyone thinks when they see these arrangements.‚Äù He gestured vaguely at me. ‚ÄúNo judgment here. A girl‚Äôs got to use her assets.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou absolute pig.‚Äù Hazel‚Äôs face flushed red. ‚ÄúGet out.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm just being honest. No need to get defensive-‚Äù

‚ÄúOut!‚Äù Hazel stood up, pointing toward the door. ‚ÄúNow.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, alright. Guess some people can‚Äôt handle the truth.‚Äù He slid out of the booth, adjusting his jacket. ‚ÄúCall me when you‚Äôre ready to be real about things.‚Äù

We watched him weave between tables toward the exit. Hazel collapsed back into her seat, mortified.

‚ÄúOh my god, Mads. I am so, so sorry. I can‚Äôt believe I thought he was decent. He seemed so nice at yoga!‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, at least we found out he was trash before the appetizers arrived.‚Äù I grabbed the menu, determined to salvage our evening. ‚ÄúNow, about those loaded nachos we always get‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúBut still! The things he said about you and Mr. Knight!‚Äù She shook her head. ‚ÄúI feel awful.‚Äù

‚ÄúForget him. Seriously.‚Äù I waved down a waiter. ‚ÄúThe nachos and two margaritas, please. Make mine a double.‚Äù

Hazel brightened with mischief. ‚ÄúAlthough, maybe Derek had a point. Not about you being ‚Äì you know ‚Äì but about Mr. Knight liking you. I‚Äôve seen the way he looks at you.‚Äù

I choked on my water, sputtering. ‚ÄúWhat? No! That‚Äôs ‚Äì that‚Äôs impossible. He‚Äôs my boss!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not? You‚Äôre smart, gorgeous, and he‚Äôs clearly interested.‚Äù

‚ÄúStop it!‚Äù I grabbed a napkin to wipe my chin. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like that at all.‚Äù

Hazel burst out laughing. ‚ÄúRelax, I‚Äôm kidding! Everyone knows Alexander Knight is Manhattan‚Äôs most notorious playboy. Different supermodels every week, yacht parties in Monaco.‚Äù She leaned forward. ‚ÄúJust be careful, okay? Don‚Äôt let that pretty face and charm fool you. Men like him don‚Äôt do relationships ‚Äì they collect trophies.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrust me, I know exactly who he is.‚Äù My phone buzzed.

I pulled out my phone to check the message. Alexander‚Äôs name flashed on the screen.

‚Äú325 Park Avenue, Penthouse. Come now.‚Äù

No explanation, no context. Typical Alexander.

‚ÄúEverything okay?‚Äù Hazel peered across the table.

‚ÄúWork.‚Äù I grabbed my purse, already sliding out of the booth. ‚ÄúRain check on those nachos?‚Äù

‚ÄúAgain? This is getting ridiculous. It‚Äôs almost 8 PM!‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, I know. But-‚Äù

‚ÄúBut nothing! You‚Äôre not his personal servant. You have a life, too. What could possibly be so urgent?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably another last-minute networking event. He does this sometimes‚Äîinvites potential investors over for drinks. Someone has to coordinate with catering and handle the guest list.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd that someone always has to be you?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my job.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour job ended three hours ago.‚Äù Hazel‚Äôs voice softened. ‚ÄúI worry about you, you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know you worry. But this job ‚Äì the benefits, the salary ‚Äì it‚Äôs helping Mom fight. I can‚Äôt risk losing it.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust be careful, okay?‚Äù

I nodded, already halfway to the door. The cool night air hit my face as I flagged down a cab.

The cab wound through Manhattan‚Äôs glittering streets. Mom‚Äôs medical bills haunted me, mounting higher each month. I couldn‚Äôt mess this up. Not when she needed me.

325 Park Avenue loomed ahead, all gleaming glass and steel stretching into the night sky. The doorman nodded as I crossed the marble lobby to the private elevator. My finger hesitated over the penthouse button. Something felt‚Ä¶ off.

Usually, when Alexander hosted impromptu gatherings, the lobby buzzed with activity‚Äîcaterers rushing supplies, guests arriving in designer suits and cocktail dresses. Tonight, there was silence.

My heels clicked against the marble floor as I stepped out, echoing through the empty space. Warm lighting spilled across modern furniture and floor-to-ceiling windows, showcasing the city‚Äôs sparkle below.

‚ÄúMr. Knight?‚Äù

No response. Just the soft whir of the central air.

The hair on my neck stood up. Something definitely wasn‚Äôt right.

A floorboard creaked behind me.

I spun around, heart hammering. Alexander stood there, leaning casually against the doorframe.

If you are using preheated water, you can brew up to 500+ times of 40ml coffee.

Conqueco portable coffee has 13500mah power battery build inside, which has the most big capacity battery in the market.

Still, people often question 8-10 Times are not enough. Based on the current battery energy density and heating technology, it will still consume a lot of power to achieve high power heating in the effective volume and complete heating and boiling water in a short period of time.¬†

As mentioned above, if you add preheated water, the number of uses will increase a lot, in fact the pump is very energy-saving, and the main power-consuming element is on the heating module.

Other portable coffee machine products such as Wacaco and Aeropress do not have built-in batteries and cannot boil water, so you need to add hot water. The Conqueco coffee machine has a built-in battery that can boil water, which is more suitable for scenarios where there is no hot water, or it is not suitable for boiling water (such as while driving).

Imagine a large group of people camping together, a campfire can easily boil a lot of hot water, take same time to fill the ground coffee, and in just a few seconds you can have a steaming cup of espresso...

I started a new job about a month and a bake ago. It's been mostly positive. I've had a lot of keyholder-assistant manager positions, because of this i tend to get hired into positions like that without having to start at the bottom. This usually makes one or two people upset. However, this time the people that dont like me are people who started working there at the same time as myself. I honestly have been struggling because I can feel it. I get ignored, people specifically dont laugh at my jokes (im actually extremely funny not to be cocky) I have been having moments where I just feel like I want to stop talking. I was told they don't like me because ""I started acting like a mom"" (I'm 4 months post partum) and then another time someone said they needed help and I blew them off. I have no recollection of blowing them off because I never would've done that on purpose. We work at a coffee shop, she told me she doesn't like me being on bar because I get too overwhelmed; I dont really feel like I get overwhelmed unless im lacking support. But also im new so I feel like im allowed to get overwhelmed when its busy.

It's important to note that an earlier day she told me ""i never know your music, you should play soemthing like kpop demon hunters, or Sabrina carpenter"" i was playing Depeche mode so its not like its a band people dont know.

I (19M) had an interest in a woman (23F) in the same course as me. For two months, we were in the same assigned study group. As the group was dissolving, I thought I'd see if there was a spark. My thinking was that if not, I'd at least make a good friend, so I invited her for coffee over text. I didn't intend for it to be a date, more of a quick, low-stakes hangout. She agreed but said she was going on holiday and would let me know when she was back. I told her I was looking forward to seeing her and that we could organise it afterwards.

She never got back to me after the week-long break. The morning our course started again, she just reacted to my original message with a thumbs-up, and that was it. I immediately knew she wasn't interested, so I didn't mention it again. I still see her around in some classes and we exchange small talk;  I definitely didn't want things to be awkward. I was confused and would be lying if I said I was not hurt a bit. Why she initially agreed then never followed up bugged me. From my perspective, you wouldn't treat a friend like that.

A month and a half later today, I was sitting at lunch with a friend of hers when she joined us. She had mentioned planning a trip for the weekend, so I asked how it was. She said it was too difficult to organise, so she dropped the idea. She then mentioned that she and her friend had planned on grinding out coursework over the weekend, but that didn't happen either. As a slight jab, I said with a smile and a laugh:

""You keep making plans and promises then not keeping them.""

I just meant it as a little jab about what she had just said. To be honest, the texting incident wasn't on my mind, but maybe it was subconsciously. She laughed for a split second, but then it got quiet between her and her friend. The realisation of how it must have sounded hit me, and I just stayed silent. I regretted it the moment I realised it. The conversation eventually restarted, and I guess we all just pretended nothing happened.

I honestly felt sick to my stomach. I really don't want it to seem like I hold a grudge. I'm just worried this comment made it look like I dislike her and I don't know if I should apologise or just keep acting civilly like I was the past month and a half barring this comment.

I started dabbling with it and things like camera angle, focal length, depth etc makes the prompt much better (I even shot a Youtube video with live prompting and outcomes as proof).

Like the output difference between ‚Äúa coffee mug on a table‚Äù and ‚Äúa close-up shot of a steaming mug under soft morning light with shallow depth of field.‚Äù

For example, I used to barely floss and thought it was overkill‚Äîbut now I do it daily, and my gums have never felt better. Same with changing my pillowcases more often or rinsing my mouth after coffee.

So I‚Äôm curious‚Äîwhat‚Äôs one hygiene habit you used to think was unnecessary or a bit extra, but now you absolutely swear by? Why did it make such a difference for you?

1o07od3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MAFS_UK/comments/1o07od3/am_i_the_only_one_on_graces_side/,Am I the only one on Graces side?,"She‚Äôs not giving mixed messages about intimacy, she was clear she didn‚Äôt want it early on and he said he respected her more for that which she saw as a red flag üö© and naturally pulled back even more at some of his comments. It was too early to be intimate on the honeymoon and lots of other couples also didn‚Äôt want to but unfortunately Grace gave everyone an easy target by claiming she doesn‚Äôt like touch and it‚Äôs a ‚Äúher issue‚Äù instead of saying the bond between them isn‚Äôt there yet. 

If he respects women who say no more, why did he then proceed to pressure her to touch him and get intimate instead of actually being respectful going at her pace. 

The more she‚Äôs opened up and tried the challenges, even when it‚Äôs been uncomfortable, the more he‚Äôs read that as ‚Äúmixed signals‚Äù instead of seeing it as progress. Mentioning her nuzzling him in front of everyone instead of sticking to the issue they‚Äôd agreed to discuss embarrassed her. Instead of appreciating that as a small step, he got frustrated about not having sex, which made her pull back again. He doesn‚Äôt seem able to appreciate the small steps without pushing for more or assuming he now has free rein.

Also she said on Instagram it wasn‚Äôt condoms they bought and if it‚Äôs not an instant protection it makes even less sense to be frustrated that she didn‚Äôt instantly sleep with him, not that buying contraception = consent anyway. 

Their values are so different, he wants to ‚Äútreat‚Äù women and feels emasculated when she pays and she feels an unequal dynamic when he pays so the compromise would be to alternate paying, to split the bill, maybe he could get small extras like paying for coffees randomly etc. But everyone forgets how early days this is and that she wouldn‚Äôt feel that ‚Äúowing intimacy‚Äù pressure anymore in an established relationship. 

Even the nails situation seems transactional, he didn‚Äôt ask if he could pay for a new set for her as they look lovely, he said keep it up as he likes that and what he would like her to get. Giving someone money to look the way you want isn‚Äôt as kind as giving them something  they want. It must be exhausting that he never seems to understand her point of view, keeps insisting he‚Äôs ‚Äújust being nice,‚Äù and leaves her feeling guilty, confused, and drained.

Not a good match as ultimately they view respect and intimacy so differently. ",38,1759820236.0,MAFS_UK,26,0.8,False

Ever wish [Systeme.io](https://growishly.com/systeme_io) forms could do more than just... text-based inputs? ü§î

A few weeks ago, I posted how I created an interactive quiz with custom outcomes... And it seemed like many people liked it based on the DMs I got.. The response and questions were amazing.

That got me thinking... what else can we push?

The big limitation I kept hearing about was Systeme's basic forms. I wanted to create real, engaging forms with multiple-choice options, radio buttons, and even an ""other"" field for custom answers.

So, after about 10 cups of coffee and hours of trial and error... I cracked it. ‚òï

The best part? Every single answer is saved directly into a custom field for that contact.

Imagine being able to personalize your follow-up emails based on their exact multiple-choice answers. This is a game-changer for lead quality and sales conversions.

The method is similar to the quiz build. For those who want to geek out, here's the blueprint:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create Your Custom Fields: First, you need a place to store the data. In Systeme, go to a contact's profile and create a unique custom field for each piece of information you want to capture.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Grab the Inline Form Code: In your funnel, create a step and choose the ""Inline Form"" option. Map your form fields to the custom fields you just created, save it, and grab the embed code.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Build the Form Front-End: This is where the magic happens. Using a bit of custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you build the beautiful, user-friendly form you want (with radio buttons, etc.). The JavaScript's job is to take the user's answers and secretly fill in the hidden Systeme inline form fields in the background.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Your Automations: Once the form is submitted, all the data is now neatly stored in the contact's custom fields. From here, you can use Systeme's automations to tag them, send personalized emails that reference their answers, and trigger any workflow you can imagine.

This proves that with a little creativity, Systeme is way more powerful than you think. üöÄ

1o07fr7,https://youtu.be/mzhkfg9zJNg,4 Very Scary TRUE Remote Land Trespass Horror Stories,"# ""The Creek Between Us"":

My husband, James, and I had lived on that patch of land in the Colorado hills for over a decade. Out there, time moved slower. The mornings smelled like pine sap and cold air, and at night, the coyotes cried somewhere beyond the ridges. It was the kind of place where you could go days without seeing another person. We liked it that way. It was quiet, simple, and honest.

Then Harlan moved in.

His property bordered ours on the west side, where the creek cut through the valley like a silver scar. The boundary was always a little fuzzy‚Äîold wire fences half-buried in weeds, markers lost to the snow and floods. But when Harlan arrived three years ago, those uncertainties turned into arguments. He was the kind of man who didn‚Äôt talk so much as bark. If he thought something was his, he‚Äôd take it‚Äîwhether that was a fallen tree, a deer, or a strip of grass on our side of the creek.

We called the sheriff more times than I can count. Every time it ended the same way: ‚ÄúTry to talk it out,‚Äù they‚Äôd say. Easy words when you didn‚Äôt have to live next to him.

Last fall, we decided to settle it once and for all. Our friends Rob and Beth, who owned the adjoining plot, had finally hired a surveyor named Tom to draw the real lines‚Äîofficially, on record. We figured that would end the shouting and the threats.

It was one of those cold afternoons when the light starts fading early, even though it‚Äôs barely past noon. We all met where the grass met the woods, the kind of quiet spot where you can hear your own heartbeat. Tom came with his orange vest, a clipboard, and those tall tripods that make everything look official. Rob handed him a folder full of old deeds, yellowed and creased from the county archives.

‚ÄúThis should do it,‚Äù Rob said, clapping Tom on the shoulder. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been dealing with this nonsense long enough.‚Äù

Beth crossed her arms, glancing toward the pines that hid Harlan‚Äôs cabin. ‚ÄúHe was over here again last week,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúRifle on his back. I‚Äôm not taking chances anymore.‚Äù

I followed her gaze. No movement. Just trees swaying and the faint shimmer of the creek below. But I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that we weren‚Äôt alone.

James must have noticed me looking. He squeezed my hand and said, quietly, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be fine, Simone. We‚Äôre just measuring dirt.‚Äù

Tom set up his gear, pacing the land in wide steps, his measuring tape glinting in the light. The rest of us followed along, marking spots with orange flags. The air felt still‚Äîtoo still. No wind, no birds, just that uneasy quiet that presses on your ears.

To fill it, we talked about anything but Harlan‚Äîabout Rob and Beth‚Äôs new roof, about the upcoming holidays. But every now and then, Rob would stop mid-sentence and stare toward the tree line, his face tightening.

‚ÄúYou think he‚Äôll show?‚Äù Beth whispered.

Rob shrugged. ‚ÄúIf he does, we‚Äôll handle it. We‚Äôre not doing anything wrong.‚Äù

About an hour later, Tom called us over near the creek. ‚ÄúHere it is,‚Äù he said, brushing aside a tangle of roots. ‚ÄúThe old marker‚Äîsee that? According to the deed, your boundary runs straight through to that big boulder there.‚Äù

James knelt, running his fingers through the dirt. ‚ÄúThat means Harlan‚Äôs shed is built on our side,‚Äù he said with a humorless laugh. ‚ÄúFigures.‚Äù

We were still laughing when the sound came‚Äîbranches snapping, slow and deliberate.

I turned toward the woods. A figure stepped out from the shadow between the pines. Harlan. His face was red from the cold or maybe from rage. His rifle was slung across his shoulder, but his hands were balled into fists.

‚ÄúWhat the hell do you think you‚Äôre doing on my land?‚Äù His voice carried across the clearing, loud enough to startle a crow from a tree.

Rob stepped forward, keeping his voice even. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre surveying the boundary, Harlan. These are official records. Tom‚Äôs got the paperwork right here.‚Äù

Harlan spat into the dirt. ‚ÄúDeeds don‚Äôt mean a damn thing. You‚Äôve been trespassing on me for years. I see you out here, sneaking around like I don‚Äôt notice.‚Äù

Beth spoke up, her tone steady but cautious. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not trespassing. The sheriff knows about this. Let‚Äôs just get the measurements done, and everyone can see the results.‚Äù

Harlan‚Äôs eyes flicked to Tom, who froze mid-step. ‚ÄúYou the one stirring this up?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPack up and leave, now, before there‚Äôs trouble.‚Äù

Tom raised both hands a little. ‚ÄúSir, I‚Äôm just doing my job. I‚Äôm not here to cause problems.‚Äù

‚ÄúMeasure what? Lies?‚Äù Harlan took a step forward. His voice had dropped now, low and thick, like something dangerous trying to hold itself back.

James moved closer to me, murmuring, ‚ÄúStay behind me.‚Äù I could feel his heartbeat against my arm.

Rob held up the papers. ‚ÄúHarlan, listen. We‚Äôre not trying to take anything from you. We just want this settled.‚Äù

Harlan laughed, a short, broken sound. ‚ÄúSettled? You steal my water, park your junk on my grass, and then drag some outsider out here to redraw my property? You think I‚Äôll let that stand?‚Äù

Beth‚Äôs voice trembled but she didn‚Äôt back down. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not true, Harlan. The records‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up!‚Äù he shouted, and swung the rifle down.

The muzzle pointed toward the ground, but it was enough. The air snapped tight like a wire pulled too far.

‚ÄúHey, easy,‚Äù Tom said softly. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just all calm down.‚Äù

Harlan‚Äôs eyes were wild. ‚ÄúYou called the cops on me last week,‚Äù he said to Rob. ‚ÄúTold them I was hunting on *your* land. You think I forgot that?‚Äù

Rob didn‚Äôt flinch. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not on your land. You‚Äôre the one crossing over. Tom‚Äôs measurements prove it. Put the gun down.‚Äù

But Harlan didn‚Äôt move. His breathing was heavy, his knuckles white on the rifle‚Äôs grip. The sound of the creek was the only thing between us and whatever was about to happen.

Then he said, quiet and final:  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trespassing right now.‚Äù

The rifle cracked.

Rob staggered, his hand pressed to his chest. The second shot came before Beth could even scream. She dropped beside him, calling his name, but it was no use.

Tom turned to run. A third shot cut him down before he reached the trees.

James pulled me by the arm. ‚ÄúRun, Simone! Get down!‚Äù

The world blurred. The smell of gunpowder burned in my nose. We dove behind a boulder as another shot tore bark from a tree above us. James shoved me lower. ‚ÄúStay here,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move.‚Äù

I peeked over the rock just long enough to see Harlan stalking forward, slow and methodical, his boots crunching in the dry grass. ‚ÄúYou think you can steal from me?‚Äù he shouted. ‚ÄúYou think you can take what‚Äôs mine?‚Äù

James took a deep breath. ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù he said. Then he stood. ‚ÄúHarlan, stop! Please, just stop!‚Äù

The rifle roared again.

James fell back, eyes wide, blood spilling through his shirt. I caught him as he went down, choking on my own scream. ‚ÄúJames‚Äîno‚Äî‚Äù

Harlan‚Äôs shadow fell across us. His voice was flat now, empty. ‚ÄúYou too. Trespassing bitch.‚Äù

I begged him not to. I don‚Äôt even remember what I said‚Äîjust the sound of my own voice shaking.

The shot burned through my side. I hit the dirt, the sky spinning above me.

He turned and walked away. Just like that.

The world went quiet again. Only the creek kept running, steady and indifferent. Rob and Beth were still. Tom lay facedown in the grass. James‚Äôs breathing slowed beside me, fading until there was nothing.

I don‚Äôt know how I found the strength, but I reached for my phone, my fingers slick with blood, and somehow managed to dial 911. ‚ÄúHelp,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúShot‚Ä¶ property line‚Ä¶ Harlan‚Ä¶‚Äù

The operator‚Äôs voice was calm, far away, asking me to stay on the line. I remember the sirens faint in the distance before everything went black.

I lived. Barely. The doctors said the bullet missed my spine by an inch. But James didn‚Äôt make it. Neither did Rob, Beth, or Tom.

All that over a strip of land‚Äîsome dirt, a creek, a few trees.

Every night since, when I close my eyes, I still see Harlan stepping out of those woods, his rifle catching the light, his face set like stone. The silence before the first shot always feels louder than the gunfire that followed.





# ""Private Property, Public Fear"":

My partner David and I had been searching for months before we found the place ‚Äî a cozy, two-bedroom home tucked at the edge of a quiet town in the Rockies. A narrow dirt road wound through pine and aspen to get there, the kind of road where cell service dropped and the world felt far away. Out back, a small creek cut through the yard, the water tumbling over smooth stones before slipping into the forest beyond. The real estate agent called it a ‚Äúhidden gem.‚Äù We agreed.

We made an offer that same evening, half afraid someone else would snatch it first. By some miracle, it was accepted. We moved in just as spring began to push the last of winter away. The air still had a chill, but the light was longer, hopeful. Boxes piled up in every corner, and we spent the first week unpacking late into the night, laughing over takeout and how, after years of renting apartments with paper-thin walls, we finally had a space that was ours.

In those first days, everything felt right. Mornings, I‚Äôd step outside barefoot with my coffee, watching the mist rise off the creek. I started imagining where I‚Äôd plant wildflowers along the banks, maybe a little bench near the bend. It felt like the start of something good ‚Äî something we‚Äôd waited a long time for.

Then, one afternoon while unpacking the kitchen, I glanced out the window and froze. Two people ‚Äî a man and a woman, middle-aged ‚Äî were sitting by the creek. They‚Äôd brought folding chairs and fishing poles, lines trailing into the water. I watched them for a moment, expecting they‚Äôd notice me, maybe wave. They didn‚Äôt. They just sat there quietly, as though they belonged.

I figured they‚Äôd wandered over from the park next door ‚Äî it shared a fence line with our property. But according to our survey, the creek was clearly on our side. I decided not to make a fuss. Maybe it was a one-time thing.

It wasn‚Äôt.

The next day, a family of four arrived just before noon. Kids splashing in the shallows, parents spreading a blanket like it was a picnic spot. I hesitated, then went outside, waving politely.

‚ÄúHi there,‚Äù I called. ‚ÄúBeautiful day, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

The father, a broad-shouldered man with a beard and a faded baseball cap, looked up. ‚ÄúAfternoon,‚Äù he said flatly.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm the new owner,‚Äù I explained, smiling. ‚ÄúJust moved in a few days ago. Didn‚Äôt expect company back here.‚Äù

He studied me for a long moment, then shrugged. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been coming to this spot for years. Old folks who lived here didn‚Äôt mind. Creek‚Äôs perfect for the kids.‚Äù

I felt a flicker of discomfort. ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs actually part of our property now,‚Äù I said gently. ‚ÄúMaybe you could stick to the park side?‚Äù

His wife folded her arms. ‚ÄúPark side‚Äôs all rocks and weeds. This is the good part. Everyone uses it. You new around here?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, just moved in,‚Äù I said, still trying to sound friendly. ‚ÄúI understand it‚Äôs been open before, but we‚Äôd like a little privacy. Maybe just for today?‚Äù

The man muttered something under his breath but eventually packed up, the kids whining as they left. As they walked off, the woman turned back. ‚ÄúYou might wanna check with the town,‚Äù she called. ‚ÄúThis ain‚Äôt just yours.‚Äù

That night, I told David over dinner. He brushed it off. ‚ÄúProbably harmless. Small towns have their habits.‚Äù

But it didn‚Äôt stop.

By the weekend, a crowd had gathered ‚Äî eight, maybe ten people ‚Äî carrying coolers, beach chairs, and Bluetooth speakers. Music drifted up from the creek, laughter echoing across our yard. My stomach twisted as I walked out again.

‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù I said. A woman in mirrored sunglasses turned toward me, her expression sharp.

‚ÄúCan I help you?‚Äù she asked, as if *I* were trespassing.

‚ÄúThis is private property,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThe creek runs through our land. Please move to the park.‚Äù

A tall man stood, hands on his hips. ‚ÄúLady, we‚Äôve been fishing here since we were kids. The old owners said it was fine. You can‚Äôt just show up and kick us out.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have the survey right here,‚Äù I said, showing my phone. ‚ÄúThe line runs directly along the park fence.‚Äù

He smirked. ‚ÄúLegal don‚Äôt mean right. This creek belongs to the community. You outsiders buy land and think you own the mountain too.‚Äù

Murmurs of agreement rippled through the group. Someone muttered, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll regret it.‚Äù

I backed away. They stayed another hour, leaving empty cans floating in the water.

The next morning, David and I ordered *No Trespassing* signs ‚Äî bright yellow, metal, unmistakable. We posted them along the fence and near the creek. It felt defiant, like drawing a line in the sand.

By morning, one of the signs had been bent nearly in half.

People kept coming. Some ignored the signs, stepping right over them. ‚ÄúPlease respect the property!‚Äù I shouted from the porch one afternoon.

A woman yelled back, ‚ÄúOr what? You gonna call the cops on families?‚Äù

David and I visited the neighbors. Most were polite but cold. An older woman told us, ‚ÄúThat creek‚Äôs been open to everyone for generations. Best not stir things up.‚Äù Another man, arms crossed, said, ‚ÄúYou bought the house, you bought the history. Deal with it.‚Äù

By midsummer, the crowds swelled ‚Äî twenty, thirty people on hot days. Kids running wild, adults drinking and tossing cans into the grass. The air was filled with laughter that no longer sounded cheerful, just invasive. I began keeping the blinds drawn, heart pounding at every sound outside.

Then came the first note.

It was tucked under a stone near the creek: *Leave the creek alone or leave town.*

I showed it to David. His face went pale. ‚ÄúThis is getting out of hand.‚Äù

We called the sheriff‚Äôs office. A deputy came, looked around, shrugged. ‚ÄúWithout catching them in the act, not much we can do. Maybe put up a fence.‚Äù

We couldn‚Äôt afford a full fence, but we strung wire along the edge. That night, I barely slept. Every creak of the house made me tense. Around midnight, I heard voices ‚Äî low, whispering ‚Äî near the water. Flashlights flickered between the trees.

‚ÄúDavid,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs out there.‚Äù

He grabbed a flashlight and went to the back door. ‚ÄúHey!‚Äù he shouted. The voices scattered. When he returned, the wire was cut in three places.

The next day, I went to town hall, survey in hand. The clerk directed me to a county commissioner ‚Äî an older man with a hard face and the weary calm of someone used to arguments.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had complaints,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFolks say you blocked access to a community spot.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not community land,‚Äù I said, trying to keep steady. ‚ÄúThe title is clear. It‚Äôs ours.‚Äù

He sighed. ‚ÄúMaybe so. But history matters here. The previous owners let everyone use it. That creates expectations.‚Äù

Expectations. The word stuck with me like a splinter.

After that, the hostility became open. People pointed as I walked through town. A woman at the grocery store whispered to her friend, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs her ‚Äî the one who closed off the creek.‚Äù

Another note appeared: *Watch your back.*

Then, one evening while watering plants, I saw him ‚Äî the tall man from before, walking up from the park. His face was red, angry.

‚ÄúYou happy now?‚Äù he barked. ‚ÄúRuining everyone‚Äôs summer?‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease leave,‚Äù I said quietly.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt belong here,‚Äù he said, stepping closer. ‚ÄúKeep this up and it‚Äôll get ugly.‚Äù

He left, but I locked every door that night. My hands wouldn‚Äôt stop shaking.

Weeks blurred together. The town filed a claim, citing an old easement law. Lawyers drained our savings. The hostility never stopped ‚Äî smashed mailbox, slashed tires, glares everywhere we went. I started dreaming of the creek ‚Äî the sound of the water turning into whispers, dozens of voices chanting beneath the surface. Sometimes, I‚Äôd wake in the dark certain someone was standing outside.

Eventually, we settled. Sold a strip of the land to the county. They fenced it off, built a little footbridge, and called it *Creekside Commons.* The crowds returned ‚Äî but stayed on their side this time. Our yard was finally quiet.

Still, I never felt peace again.

Even now, when I hear water running, I tense. The creek flows the same as it always did ‚Äî bright, cold, beautiful ‚Äî but to me, it sounds different. Like it remembers what happened. Like it‚Äôs whispering that nothing you own ever truly belongs to you ‚Äî not the land, not the peace, not even your safety.

Because sometimes, when the wind shifts just right, I can swear I still hear them down there ‚Äî laughing, somewhere past the dark trees, just beyond the fence.





# ""Behind the Fence"":

I moved to that quiet valley a few months back, hoping to find peace after a brutal year in the city. My nerves were shot; I needed somewhere quiet, somewhere I could breathe again. The house I bought was small but perfect‚Äîtucked at the end of a winding dirt road with pine trees crowding close, their branches whispering against the roof when the wind picked up. There were only two other homes nearby, and the silence between us felt like freedom.

One neighbor was an older man named Harold who lived farther up the hill, in a creaking two-story place that looked like it had been standing there long before the rest of us. From the start, something about him felt wrong. He never waved back, never smiled. Just stood on his porch, staring. Sometimes I‚Äôd look up from my morning coffee and see him there, motionless, like a figure carved from the gloom.

Our properties shared a narrow driveway, split by a gravel strip that led to my garage. That‚Äôs where the trouble started.

At first, it was small things‚Äîhandwritten notes tucked under my windshield wiper, the paper damp with dew. Messages scrawled in a shaky hand: *Don‚Äôt park past the line. Stay off what‚Äôs mine.*

The real estate agent had mentioned a minor boundary issue when I bought the place‚Äîsomething about an old survey dispute‚Äîbut I‚Äôd assumed it was just bureaucratic nonsense. The latest maps showed that the strip was mine to access. I figured Harold was just territorial and that we‚Äôd eventually sort it out like reasonable adults.

I was wrong.

One afternoon, while trimming a bush near the edge, Harold appeared at his fence. His face was flushed, eyes hard and distant.  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on my land,‚Äù he said quietly.  
I straightened up. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so. This is my yard. I‚Äôve got the survey if you want to check.‚Äù  
‚ÄúI‚Äôve checked,‚Äù he said, his tone colder now. ‚ÄúYou people always push. Step back before there‚Äôs trouble.‚Äù

*You people?* I wanted to ask what he meant, but something in his stare froze the words in my throat. I backed away.

That night, my dog started growling at the window, hackles raised. When I went outside with a flashlight, the woods looked still, but I could feel eyes on me. In the morning, I found a long scratch running down my car door, deep enough to bare the metal beneath the paint.

I wanted to believe it was kids or a random vandal, but I knew better.

A week later, my sister Lena came over for dinner. We grilled out back, trying to enjoy the crisp mountain air. We were laughing about something when Harold‚Äôs voice carried down the hill, deep and harsh.  
‚ÄúKeep it down! And stay off my property!‚Äù

Lena frowned. ‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù  
‚ÄúHarold,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs obsessed with this stupid boundary. Thinks I‚Äôm stealing part of his land.‚Äù  
She laughed. ‚ÄúOld guys and their fences. Don‚Äôt give him the satisfaction.‚Äù

But I couldn‚Äôt laugh it off anymore.

When she left that night, her jacket fell near the edge of the strip. She stepped a few feet over to grab it‚Äîand Harold was *there*, like he‚Äôd been waiting. A flashlight beam hit her square in the face.  
‚ÄúTrespassing!‚Äù he shouted. ‚ÄúYou think I don‚Äôt see? You‚Äôll regret this!‚Äù

Lena froze. ‚ÄúIt was an accident, sir‚Äî‚Äù  
‚ÄúAccidents have consequences.‚Äù He stepped closer, his voice almost a growl.

I ran over, heart pounding. ‚ÄúLeave her alone, Harold! She‚Äôs leaving.‚Äù  
He turned that glare on me. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt over.‚Äù Then he vanished into the dark like smoke.

The next morning, my mailbox was smashed to pieces.

I started locking up earlier, checking my doors twice. I‚Äôd catch glimpses of Harold in his yard at night‚Äîplanting things, rearranging rocks along the edge, building invisible walls between us. When I called the county, they said it was a *civil matter*.

‚ÄúGet a lawyer,‚Äù they told me.

So I did. Tom, my lawyer, looked over the paperwork and frowned. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre legally in the clear,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut this guy sounds unstable. Document everything.‚Äù

Tom sent Harold a letter, polite but firm, asking him to stop blocking the shared access. Harold never replied. Instead, he planted a line of shrubs right down the middle of the strip‚Äîlike a living barricade. I couldn‚Äôt even get my car to the garage without plowing through them.

That evening, I confronted him. He was out watering his yard with a rusty metal can.  
‚ÄúHarold, we need to settle this,‚Äù I said, trying to sound calm. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre blocking my access. The deeds are clear.‚Äù  
He turned slowly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been invading my space since the day you got here. I know your type.‚Äù  
‚ÄúMy type?‚Äù  
He smiled faintly. ‚ÄúThe kind that ends up sorry.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt sleep that night. Every creak of the house felt like a footstep. Every shadow outside looked like him.

A few days later, my cat went missing. I searched until dawn, calling her name through the mist. I found her by the road that morning‚Äîstill, small, her body twisted unnaturally. There was foam on her lips. I didn‚Äôt need a vet to tell me what happened.

I buried her under the old maple tree, hands shaking so badly I could barely hold the shovel. When I looked up, I saw Harold watching from his porch, his face unreadable behind the screen door.

Tom told me to file for a restraining order. I promised I would. But Harold moved faster.

When I came home two days later, there was a boulder‚Äîmassive, gray, easily a ton‚Äîsitting squarely in the middle of that narrow strip. I couldn‚Äôt even pull into my garage.

Rage took over. I grabbed a shovel and started digging around it, trying to loosen the earth. That‚Äôs when my friend Jake pulled up‚Äîhe‚Äôd been planning to help me fix a gutter.  
‚ÄúWhat the hell is that?‚Äù he asked.  
‚ÄúHarold‚Äôs latest move,‚Äù I said through gritted teeth. ‚ÄúHelp me push it aside.‚Äù

We worked together, sweat pouring, the air thick and silent except for the scrape of metal on stone. The boulder shifted a few inches. Then‚Äî

‚ÄúStop that!‚Äù

Harold‚Äôs voice rang out sharp as a whip. He was walking down the hill, face twisted, hands clenched. Something heavy was tucked beneath his shirt at his belt.

‚ÄúCall the cops,‚Äù I whispered. Jake grabbed his phone.  
Harold pointed at us. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trespassing. Get off my land!‚Äù  
‚ÄúThis is my access!‚Äù I shouted back. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt block it!‚Äù

Jake was already speaking into the phone. ‚ÄúYes, there‚Äôs a man threatening us‚Äîsend someone fast‚Äî‚Äù

Harold‚Äôs hand moved to his belt. I saw the gun glint in the last light of dusk.

‚ÄúJake, he‚Äôs armed!‚Äù

Jake stepped back, hands raised. ‚ÄúEasy, man. Nobody wants trouble.‚Äù  
Harold‚Äôs voice trembled with fury. ‚ÄúYou started this. You won‚Äôt steal from me again.‚Äù

The shot cracked like lightning. Jake stumbled backward, clutching his chest.

‚ÄúNO!‚Äù I screamed, diving behind the car as another bullet shattered the window.

‚ÄúShots fired!‚Äù I yelled into the fallen phone. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs shooting!‚Äù

I saw Harold‚Äôs boots crunch over the gravel as he advanced, muttering, ‚ÄúYou people... always pushing.‚Äù

I ran for the house, heart hammering, zigzagging as another bullet tore through the air. I slammed the door shut, locked it, crouched behind the couch. Through the window, I saw him standing over Jake, gun raised.

‚ÄúStop!‚Äù I screamed, but the next shot drowned me out. Jake went still.

Then Harold turned toward my house. Slowly. Purposefully.

He walked up the path, muttering to himself. ‚ÄúTrespassers... all the same.‚Äù

The dispatcher‚Äôs voice crackled faintly from the phone: *‚ÄúStay hidden. Help is on the way.‚Äù*

He pounded on my door. The whole frame shook.  
‚ÄúCome out!‚Äù he shouted. ‚ÄúFace what you did!‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt move. I didn‚Äôt even breathe.

Minutes stretched into forever‚Äîuntil sirens finally split the valley silence. Red and blue lights flickered through the trees. Harold froze, then turned and trudged up the hill toward his house.

The police found Jake alive, barely. The bullet had missed his heart by an inch. Harold surrendered without a fight, mumbling about ‚Äúdefending his property.‚Äù

At the trial, I testified‚Äîvoice shaking, palms damp‚Äîas I described every note, every glare, every whispered threat. Harold stared straight ahead, expression blank, as the judge handed down a life sentence.

It‚Äôs been months since then. I‚Äôve moved to a new town, a new house with no shared driveways, no neighbors in sight. But sometimes, when the wind brushes against the walls at night, I still hear that voice, cold and trembling with rage:

*‚ÄúGet off my land.‚Äù*





# ""The Ryder Feud"":

I had just finished repairing the wheel on our stagecoach when the messenger rode up, his horse lathered white, his face pale under the dust. It was early afternoon, the sun burning low through the gum trees near Lucan Station. I was alone, wiping grease from my hands when he thrust a folded note into my palm without a word, then wheeled his horse and tore back down the road like the devil was chasing him.

The note was brief, written in a familiar, jagged hand: *Your family's time on this land is done. Leave, or face what's coming.*  
No signature, but I knew it belonged to one of the Ryder boys. Our troubles with them had been festering for years‚Äîever since Father claimed that northern plot. It had been wild ground back then, all scrub and stone, but we cleared it, fenced it, and made something that might‚Äôve lasted. The land was rightfully ours, though the locals never saw it that way. To them, we were still outsiders‚Äîimmigrants who‚Äôd come from across the ocean with nothing but our hunger to live.

I tucked the note in my pocket and rode home, the wagon creaking beneath me. My brothers and I ran the coach line together‚ÄîTom the eldest, Robert and Daniel the younger, and me stuck in the middle. It was honest work, carrying passengers and mail between towns, and it kept food on the table. But success breeds enemies. The Flanagans hated us for cutting into their business. They‚Äôd poison feed, cut harness straps, and once I caught one of their hands sneaking near the barn with a can of oil.  
‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù I shouted, grabbing his arm.  
He tore free and fled into the dark, yelling back, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll pay for taking what‚Äôs not yours!‚Äù

When I got home that evening, Mother was in the kitchen, sleeves rolled up, kneading dough like she was fighting the world with her bare hands. Father sat by the fire, the pipe tight between his teeth, eyes clouded from the years. Prison had changed him‚Äîhe‚Äôd done time for a fight over that same cursed land. ‚ÄúEdward,‚Äù he said, his voice a slow growl, ‚Äúyou look like you‚Äôve seen trouble.‚Äù

I handed him the note. Mother‚Äôs jaw set hard. ‚ÄúThose cowards,‚Äù she muttered. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been crossing our fences for months, letting their cattle graze where they shouldn‚Äôt. Last week I chased two of them off with a broom.‚Äù  
Father stared into the fire. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got rights to this land. The court said so. But these people‚Äîthese so-called neighbors‚Äîthey whisper in church and call it law. I‚Äôve heard the priest talking about a ‚Äòpeace society.‚Äô Says it‚Äôs to keep thieves away. I know what he means. He means *us*.‚Äù

We talked late into the night. My sister Jane sat quiet near the window, her hands twisting in her lap. ‚ÄúBrother,‚Äù she said softly, ‚ÄúI saw men watching the house yesterday. Up by the trees. They didn‚Äôt move, just watched.‚Äù  
I tried to reassure her. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only talk. They won‚Äôt dare.‚Äù But even as I said it, I felt something cold settle in my chest.

The days that followed proved me wrong. Trespassers came bolder now‚Äîtools stolen from the shed, wires cut, horses spooked. One morning a rock smashed through the window, a message tied to it: *Squatters go home.*

I was mending fence a few days later when Patrick Quigley‚Äîone of the peace society men‚Äîappeared on our side of the line. ‚ÄúThis ain‚Äôt your land, Edward,‚Äù he said, voice thick with scorn. ‚ÄúEveryone knows it.‚Äù  
‚ÄúThe judge ruled otherwise,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúNow get off before I make you.‚Äù  
He laughed, slow and mean. ‚ÄúYou think a piece of paper protects you? One day soon, we‚Äôll settle this proper.‚Äù Then he spat on our soil and walked away.

That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. The house creaked and whispered with the wind, but every sound felt deliberate, like footsteps outside. My wife, Nora, stirred beside me.  
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù she whispered.  
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre planning something,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI can feel it.‚Äù  
‚ÄúThen go to the constable.‚Äù  
I shook my head. ‚ÄúCarroll? He‚Äôs one of them. Last time Father complained, Carroll told him we‚Äôd ‚Äòbrought it on ourselves.‚Äô‚Äù

The next morning, John‚Äîmy brother from down the road‚Äîrode in pale-faced. ‚ÄúRyder‚Äôs barn burned last night,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre saying *we* did it.‚Äù  
By noon, a mob appeared‚ÄîRyder and his sons out front, guns across their saddles. ‚ÄúYou devils burned my property!‚Äù Ryder roared.  
Father stepped forward, calm but cold. ‚ÄúWe did no such thing.‚Äù  
Ryder‚Äôs eldest leaned down from his horse. ‚ÄúThe society‚Äôs done waiting. You‚Äôll see justice soon.‚Äù  
They rode off, dust rising behind them, leaving silence that felt heavy as judgment.

We took turns keeping watch at night. I remember one still evening, lantern low, rifle across my knees. Out by the barn, I saw movement‚Äîthree figures slipping through the fence. My blood ran cold. I went out quietly, boots sinking into wet grass.  
‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù I called.  
McGrath turned, the firelight catching his smirk. ‚ÄúJust checking on our missing cattle.‚Äù  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trespassing.‚Äù  
‚ÄúThis land was never yours,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSoon everyone will know it.‚Äù  
They disappeared into the dark, leaving me with the rifle trembling in my grip.

The weeks crawled by, tension wound tight. The priest preached about wicked men poisoning the valley. His eyes lingered on us from the pulpit. Bridget, my niece, came to me one afternoon, trembling. ‚ÄúUncle Edward,‚Äù she whispered, ‚ÄúI heard voices last night. Outside the window. They said‚Ä¶ they said they‚Äôd finish it soon.‚Äù  
I held her close. ‚ÄúStay near the house. Don‚Äôt go anywhere alone.‚Äù

But all the watchfulness in the world couldn‚Äôt save us. One afternoon, while I was away on the coach run, they came for Father. Carroll and his men accused him of arson, dragged him to town in chains. They released him after the hearing, no evidence found‚Äîbut everyone knew it was a warning.

Then came the night of the fire.

It was past midnight when I woke to footsteps crunching on the path outside. Dozens of them. I looked out the window and froze. A mob was gathering‚Äîmen with torches, their faces masked by rags. The glow of oil lamps flickered on their tools‚Äîaxes, clubs, guns.  
‚ÄúEdward!‚Äù someone shouted. Ryder‚Äôs voice.  
John, who‚Äôd stayed for supper, moved toward the door. ‚ÄúStay with Nora,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll speak to them.‚Äù  
Before I could stop him, he opened the door.  
‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù he demanded.  
The answer came in thunder‚Äîgunfire. John staggered, then fell hard, blood blooming across his chest. Nora screamed, and I pulled her to the floor as bullets tore through the boards. I saw faces in the flash of the gunfire‚ÄîQuigley, Carroll, McGrath‚Äîneighbors I‚Äôd shared bread with, now snarling like animals.  
After what felt like forever, a voice said, ‚ÄúEnough for tonight. The rest is done.‚Äù Then the mob melted into the dark.

1o07dkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1o07dkb/i_married_the_cripple_to_get_revenge/,I Married The Cripple To Get Revenge,"I opened my eyes and it hit me‚ÄîI was back. Back to the day I was supposed to sign my life away to that cursed marriage contract.



My past life flashed before my eyes. My cousin Summer and I were both set to marry into the filthy-rich Riches family. I was promised to Rich ""Golden Boy"" Richie, the family's pride and joy, while she got stuck with his wheelchair-bound uncle, Rich Jr.



Summer begged me to swap places, but I refused. So she ditched her wedding, left Rich Jr. at the altar, and turned the whole city into her audience.



Then, when I was seven months pregnant, she teamed up with my own brother, River, to cut my baby out of me. They left me to bleed out in some basement, alone and in agony.



But that wasn't enough for her. Summer went full psycho, scheming her way into Richie's arms until she became the new Mrs. Rich. My father knew everything‚Äîand helped cover it up.



When my mom uncovered the truth and tried to fight for me, they locked her out on the patio. She jumped. She couldn't live without me.



Now here I was, alive again, staring at the same gaudy living room piled high with gold bars and glittering jewelry. My dad was practically salivating, his double chin jiggling with excitement. Marrying into the Riches family was his ticket to power in this town.



My father‚Äîusually colder than ice‚Äîactually looked at me with something like approval. ""Rainy,"" he said, ""you're finally good for something.""



His words sent a shiver down my spine. Wasn't I supposed to be dead? Carved open? Rotting somewhere?



Before I could even catch my breath, I heard a familiar whimper behind me.



""I'm so jealous of you, Rainy,"" Summer cried, clutching her chest dramatically. ""You've always had everything‚Äîa mother who loves you, and now you get to marry someone like Richie Rich. And what do I get? A cripple who can't even walk.""



She wobbled like she was about to faint. Dad and River rushed to her side, fussing over her like she was made of glass.



""Summer, calm down!"" River snapped, shooting me a venomous look. ""You know what the doctor said‚Äîno stress!""



My mom stood off to the side, wringing her hands. She's always been too soft-hearted. River and I are her twins, the center of her world. She never could stand seeing either of us hurt.



Then Summer finally choked out the question I knew was coming. ""Rainy‚Ä¶ could you please‚Ä¶ switch with me?""



It felt like a punch to the gut. The same request that started it all last time.



Last life, I shut her down immediately. I married Richie, got pregnant, and then Summer‚Äîwho'd gone missing after ditching her own wedding‚Äîshowed up again, green with envy. She kidnapped me, sliced me open, and killed my baby. Then she took my place as Richie's wife.



They thought a double murder was bad luck, so they skipped the funeral and flushed my ashes down the toilet. When Mom tried to stop them, they locked her outside until she jumped, joining her dead daughter.



While I was lost in thought, Dad and River grew impatient.



""Hey! Did you hear what Summer asked you?"" River barked, raising a hand like he was about to grab my ear.



But Mom stepped in front of me. ""Don't you touch my daughter.""



Dad's meaty hand swung down anyway‚Äîand caught Mom across the face. His sharp nails left a long, bloody gash on her cheek.



""Mom!"" I cried, cradling her face. Rage boiled inside me, but I swallowed it down.



I forced a smile and made a choice‚Äîthe exact opposite of what I did before.



""Sure,"" I said calmly. ""I'll switch.""



Dad lowered his hand. Summer and River exchanged triumphant looks.



Only Mom looked worried. ""Rainy, don't be rash,"" she whispered. ""This is your life‚Äîthink it through!""



Summer clutched her chest again, turning on the waterworks. ""Auntie, how can you be so unfair? Rainy has everything! Can't she let me have just one thing?""



River jumped to her defense, glaring at Mom. ""Yeah, Mom, seriously? Why can't Summer have this one thing?""



Mom looked heartbroken. Her own son, taking an outsider's side over hers. She fell silent, wiping a tear away.



Quietly, I pulled Mom behind me and shot River a cold glare. ""I already agreed to switch. Why are you still yelling?""



River opened his mouth to argue, but Summer tugged his arm.



""River,"" she said sweetly, ""help me count the gifts first.""



Her eyes were locked on the gold and jewels. She didn't care about Mom. She didn't care about me. Not then, and not now.



But this time‚Ä¶ things would be different.







Chapter 2





Summer could have had all those things, but would they have truly been worth it?



I knew Richie Rich better than anyone‚Äîand I knew he was bad news. If Summer wanted to suffer in my place? Fine. I'd let her.



A month later, we got married on the same day.



She walked down the aisle with Richie Rich, the town's golden boy. I married his disabled uncle, Rich Jr.



On my wedding day, Rich Jr. wasn't able to stand and greet guests, so I faced the ceremony alone.



Summer, meanwhile, floated through the crowd on Richie's arm, showered with attention and praise.



My dad and my brother, River, doted on her, their faces glowing with pride. Only my mom watched me with anxious eyes, clearly worried about what my future held.



It took some effort to reassure her and get her to hide her concern.



Late that night, after the last of the guests had trickled out of the Rich family mansion, I found myself in the bridal suite with Rich Jr.



He looked at me apologetically. ""I'm sorry you had to go through all that alone.""



I just smiled, unfazed. I took hold of his wheelchair and pushed him toward the bed. ""We're married now. No need to be so formal.""



He blinked, surprised. ""You're not‚Ä¶ disgusted by my condition?""



I shook my head, a soft laugh escaping me. ""If I were, I wouldn't have married you.""



That brought a smile to his face too.



I helped him bathe and change. Later, in the king-sized bed, he took my hand, and we both drifted into a dreamless sleep.



After the weddings, Summer and I both lived under the same roof at the Rich estate.



While Rich Jr. and I settled into a relationship built on quiet respect, she and Richie were like a pair of rabbits in heat.



Two months later, Summer announced she was pregnant.



Richie and Rich Jr. happened to be out of town, so Dad and River rushed over, absolutely over the moon.



If it was a boy, he'd be the first grandson‚Äîthe future heir to the Rich fortune.



Dad even insisted that Mom stay behind to take care of Summer.



The Rich household had more than enough staff. I didn't want my mom playing servant, so I spoke up. ""The housekeeper can look after Summer. There's no reason for Mom to stay.""



Before I could finish, River stormed over like he was about to hit me. ""Rainy, you're heartless!"" he yelled. ""When I was drowning as a kid, you didn't lift a finger to save me! Now Summer needs help, and you're just being selfish!""



""How are we even related?""



I was stunned.



I'd never understood why he hated me so much. Now it finally made sense.



He thought I'd stood by and done nothing when he was drowning‚Äîthat it was Summer who had saved him.



But the truth was, I was the one who dragged him to shore. When I tried to climb out, the current pulled me downstream.



He woke up with Summer by his side and assumed she was his rescuer.



So in his eyes, I was heartless‚Äîand a clumsy fool.



It was a stupid misunderstanding, one that could've been cleared up if he'd ever bothered to ask. But I was done explaining. If he wanted to hate me, so be it.







Chapter 3





River's face flushed crimson with rage.



Summer latched onto his arm. ""River, please, take me to look at the jewelry. I want to wear something new,"" she cooed.



She was completely oblivious to my feelings‚Äîshe didn't even glance my way.



My mother stood there in silence. I took her hand and gently led her out of the house.



We settled onto the sofa together, and Mom looked like she was struggling to find the right words.



I cut her off gently and handed her a thick folder.



Confused, she took it. ""What's this, Rainy?""



""Open it,"" I urged.



Her hands began to shake as she pulled out the photographs. She looked as if she might tear them to shreds right then and there.



The pictures were of my father and her deceased sister. The truth was staggering: Dad had been having an affair with his sister-in-law even before he met my mother.



Everything suddenly made sense. That's why my own father had always treated my cousin better than me.



It turned out she wasn't my cousin at all‚Äîshe was my half-sister.



I had gathered this evidence myself, knowing I had to tell Mom.



She broke down, crying and laughing almost hysterically. She was over fifty years old, and her whole world had just shattered.



After a few moments, Mom stood up, went to the bathroom, washed her face, and carefully applied her makeup. Then, she headed back downstairs, her posture firm.



I followed, ready to support her. She offered a strained smile to the three of them. ""Honey, River, you can go home now. I'll take care of Summer.""



Dad and River exchanged bewildered looks, but Summer was beaming.



Mom understood. Summer was doing all this to get back at her own mother.



Mom simply smiled back, and the three of them ended up staying.



Over the following weeks, Mom waited on Summer hand and foot, while Summer yelled and complained constantly. The food was too hot, then too cold‚Äîbut Mom followed every command without a word of protest.



Summer seemed thrilled. Within three months, she had ballooned to two hundred pounds. She probably thought she was happy‚Äîher figure was ruined, but she was finally pregnant.



She insisted Mom accompany her to every doctor's appointment, just to flaunt the pregnancy.



But at the three-month checkup, Summer went alone. When she returned, she was white as a ghost and locked herself in her room, skipping dinner entirely.



Mom and I knew she was hiding something.



The next day, Summer was suddenly all smiles. She invited me for tea to apologize‚Äîpointedly excluding Mom. I knew it was a trap, but I went anyway, determined to uncover her secret.



""Rainy, I was wrong. I truly hope you can forgive me,"" Summer said, pushing a cup toward me.



I didn't touch it.



She wouldn't let up. ""These coffee beans are imported. Please, just one sip, Rainy."" Then she started sobbing dramatically.



The sudden silence in the room made everyone stare at me as if I were the villain.



Just to end the scene, I finally took a small sip. ""Are you happy now?"" I asked coldly.



A triumphant grin flashed across Summer's face before she left.



I rushed straight to the hospital, but suddenly, a hand clamped over my mouth, and I was dragged into a dark alley. I couldn't scream.



A burning heat spread from my stomach through my entire body. I couldn't believe it‚Äîshe had drugged my drink.



A man with a foul stench started touching my face. I shuddered, trying to break free, but the drug made my limbs feel like lead.



Just as I thought it was all over, a figure shot into the alley and sent the man flying with a powerful kick.



I stared in shock as Rich Jr. pummeled my attacker. ""You‚Ä¶ you can stand?!"" I stammered.



He didn't answer. Instead, he called someone to clean up the mess, then helped me into his car. My face was on fire; the drug was taking over, blurring my vision. All I could see was the sheen of sweat on his neck.



Rich Jr. swallowed hard. ""Don't move. We're going home.""



All I could think about was paying him back for saving me.



After that incident, Summer kept inviting me out, but I knew she was up to no good. I rejected her every time.

Frustratingly vinted would only offer yodel door to door as a shipping option despite me and the seller having disabled it as an option. All I could find online was people saying it's in the buyers settings. However, eventually we figured out it was that the item category 'espresso machine' in this case, automatically put the shipping as above 5kg and forced the door to door option. Once the buyer changed the category the normal choices were there!

I'd never use yodel door to door they'd leave my parcel in the street! 

Hope this helps!",0,1759818928.0,vinted,0,0.5,False

Before my SL7, I only rode fixed gear.  
Now, I am looking for a ""whatever my road bike can't do"" bike.  
A local coffee shop changed from road group rides in favor of no-drop gravel rides and would love to join them.

I was leaning towards the State before Primos announced their pre-order which addressed a lot of issues including going from 44T to 40T, paint in threads, frame bolts seizing, and the seat post slipping.

Tire clearance on both are great and the supplied tires will suffice.

Please let me know if I missed anything that I should be considering pro/con wise.

Thanks in advance!

I make no apologies for being who i am though, the older i get, i seem to care less about what people think or say these days. I'm more comfortable in my skin than ever before and i know what i like and what i dont like. I'm straight up honest and will say what's on my mind but at the same time, im empathic (sometimes it's a curse, and yes it's contradictory) and wear my heart on my sleeve.

**Things i dont like:**  
*One worded responses, going to bed early, cats, twats riding scooters, being out in the cold, crowds of people, being stuck behind slow walking people, cold showers, noisy people in the cinema, dancing.*

**My bad points:**  
*Over thinking, i have been called intense before, and i have a tendency to take things to heart.*

I‚Äôll be landing at Hyderabad Airport this Sunday around 4 PM and  have a long layover until 8 PM. 
Instead of waiting around at the airport, I‚Äôd love to step out and make the most out of those few hours. May be explore the city a bit, try out some good and nice restaurants or cafes and just soak in the vibe.
Maybe do a little sightseeing if time permits.

It would be lovely to have a little company for cafe hopping and hangout session or a quick city scroll during this short window.

If anyone has recommendations for must-visit spots or If you‚Äôve got a few hours to spare and feel like sharing good food, coffee and conversations, I‚Äôd be absolutely delighted to have you join.

I can't see but from what i understand the table is lodged between the closet and the door so the door has only 1cm of space to open and then it's completely blocked.
I managed to remeove the bottom hinge but it's not doing much, and the top one is unreachable.

1o07459,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstory/comments/1o07459/the_horrors_of_a_saturday_morning/,The horrors of a Saturday morning,"this is just a little story me and my friends wrote. It‚Äôs not gonna be published or anything, but it just made me and my friends happy. The name of the story is a horror of a Saturday morning. The horrors of a Saturday morning

A small town for secrets full of back stories one Saturday changed everything Saturday was Sarah‚Äôs favorite coffee with her friends. Just wish she would‚Äôve got to live to see a few more.

Characters Anna, Sarah‚Äôs mom, Noah, Kenzie‚Äôs boyfriend, Kenzie, Sarah‚Äôs best friend, Maddie, Kenzie, and Sarah‚Äôs best friend Dexter, the police officer

Chapter 1: Saturday Morning Shock Here's how that Saturday morning really went down: Kenzie and I walked into the gas station. My heart sank when I saw Noah and Maddie kissing. Kenzie exploded, yelling and throwing a coffee at Noah. We stormed out of there, leaving them in the dust.

Chapter 2: The Unexplained Encounter Later, Noah found a way to talk to me. He explained everything, how Maddie had manipulated him, how he was caught completely off guard by the kiss, and that it wasn't what it seemed. He laid out details that made it clear Noah was innocent. He was just a pawn in Maddie's games.

Chapter 3: A Deeper Secret Revealed In telling me the truth, Noah inadvertently revealed a deeper secret. Because of what Noah told me, I realized something far more sinister was at play. I understood the full extent of Maddie's deception and, more chillingly, Dexter's involvement in something that went way beyond a simple affair. I knew too much. And because I knew the truth, Dexter killed me. As a police officer, he had the perfect cover-up. No one would suspect him.

Chapter 4: Hope's Tragic Connection And no one did suspect him until Hope knew everything but she didn‚Äôt wanna believe it. Hope loved the back stories so sad. She grew up poor without a mother father very disturbed live in an orphanage all of our life foster home to foster home till she turned 13 was adopted by Lily and James. They were the only thing she had. They were the closest thing she had to mother and father. She was a baby when her mother and father died, so she always found comfort in Dexter in high school. They were both very smart, graduated at a young age. They are planning to just be the perfect couple to make up for all the years that were perfect, but Dexter knew Hope knew and he had no choice. My death was a sad story. Hope's life was just down down and then up.

Chapter 5: Unraveling the Truth Then Noah and Kenzie put all their pieces together. They found my diary. The last time I wrote it was Saturday morning before I was dead. I knew I was going to die. I wrote letters and I said that I love them and I told them who it was, how it happened, because Dexter wanted to plan out this way. He made me write and write so that there‚Äôd still be a piece of me with Kenzie and Noah so they‚Äôd always feel like that they could‚Äôve saved me. I love you, Kenzie, and I just wish it didn‚Äôt have to end like this, but Noah and Kenzie were back together. Maddie and Dexter were both in jail. I was dead, but let it be known Saturday will never be the same again.
