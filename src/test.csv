1ftel1f,https://i.redd.it/xeelrwezc2sd1.jpeg,How I quit with mild withdrawal symptoms,"Was using about a can of 6mg Zyn per day for the last 3 years. Vape, chew or cigs for most of the 13 years prior. The chart shows how I tapered with the slower release nicotine lozenges over the last 7 weeks. About to hit 72 hours nicotine free and feel great. There were some days that I felt low energy, mildly depressed/anxious but not too bad. I would drink an extra coffee or do a cold plunge to get through. When cutting down to 20mg per day I woke up with cold sweats around 2am for 3 nights. Was able to go back to sleep after 20 minutes awake. 

Unsure of the merits between cold turkey vs. taper but tapering made the withdrawal symptoms easy to manage & remedy even if more prolonged over weeks. 


Other things that helped me quit.

-Quit THC & Alcohol the 2 months prior.
-Documenting in my phone every time I used nicotine with mg amount, charting it in Excel and making of a game of it to try and do a little less the next day. ",1,1727753089.0,QuittingZyn,0,1.0,False,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x10eaf3c80>

1ftejy5,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1ftejy5/creating_a_long_term_rental_stay_in_thailand/,Creating a long term rental stay in Thailand,"Hey all,

I'm in a very fortunate position that the property that I own used to be a homestay & I can renovate for digital nomads to stay. Quick about: Total of 7 Rooms (two studios) each room being about 25m2, there is a big 10x4 pool, outdoor areas to eat, play badminton & sit by a firepit a communal kitchen, plenty of parking space, steam room, apothecary bathing room, ice baths.

Now I have two directions I can go;

1: Either renovate each room to have a little kitchenette & dedicated workspace (kitchenette won't have a hob but the communal kitchen will)

2: Rooms are just rooms to sleep & relax in and I renovate one of the houses into a coworking area with a home cinema/ relax room & a massage room (massage chairs & call in masseuse for Thai massages).

I'm a DN so I of course will be fitting sit/ stand desks for everyone, comfy ergo chairs, monitors & mini PC for each desk, offer mouse/ keyboards & noise canceling headphones etc for all who rent.

If you work in the coworking space your electricity bill will be less each month so keep that in mind, but I know some people like to work in their own place, perhaps I can renovate the coworking area into cubicles for more privacy? Free water & coffee/ tea will be provided every day.

Price would be reasonable as I know the digital nomad community can be earning $800-4K+ a month so finding a good price is important to me, I want to create a space that is for digital nomads to get work done & relax. 

Can't decide on what direction to go with the rooms/ coworking area. I feel as if I build the rooms with it's own office space you'd feel (as I feel) like you just live & work 24/7 in a confined space, with the corworking area you can separate the work from relaxing but lose a bit of privacy while working.

What do you believe would be best? Any and all thoughts would be appreciated, I'm very lucky to be in this situation so would like to make sure I do it right!

1ftedm6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ftedm6,"Tuesday 10-01-2024 The Art of Equilibrium: Navigating the Work & Personal Life Tightrope • Word of The Day ""Balancing""","## Harmony in the Modern Age: Mastering the Work & Personal Life Balancing Act

In today's fast-paced world, the concept of balancing professional responsibilities with personal life has become increasingly crucial. This delicate equilibrium involves effectively managing time and energy between career obligations and personal pursuits, relationships, and self-care. Achieving this balance is often challenging, as individuals face demanding work schedules, constant connectivity, and societal pressures to excel in multiple areas of life.

One of the primary obstacles in maintaining equilibrium is the blurring of boundaries between work and personal life. With the advent of smartphones and remote work capabilities, many find themselves answering emails or taking calls outside of traditional office hours. This constant connectivity can lead to burnout and negatively impact personal relationships. To address this challenge, it is essential to establish clear boundaries, such as designating specific work hours and creating separate spaces for professional and personal activities.

Effective time management plays a pivotal role in achieving harmony between work and personal life. Prioritizing tasks, setting realistic goals, and learning to delegate can help individuals allocate their time more efficiently. Techniques such as the Pomodoro method or time-blocking can enhance productivity during work hours, allowing for more quality time to be spent on personal interests and relationships.

The impact of technology on work-life integration cannot be overstated. While digital tools have increased flexibility and efficiency in many aspects of work, they have also contributed to the expectation of constant availability. It is crucial to leverage technology mindfully, using it to streamline tasks and communication while also implementing digital detoxes and setting boundaries around device usage during personal time.

Maintaining a balanced lifestyle yields significant benefits for both mental and physical health. Individuals who successfully manage their work and personal lives often report lower stress levels, improved mood, and better overall well-being. Regular exercise, adequate sleep, and time for hobbies and relaxation are essential components of a healthy lifestyle that can positively impact job performance and personal satisfaction.

Employers play a vital role in promoting work-life balance among their employees. Progressive organizations recognize that well-rested, satisfied employees are more productive and loyal. Implementing flexible work arrangements, offering mental health support, and encouraging the use of vacation time are some ways companies can foster a culture that values balance.

Cultural attitudes towards work-life balance vary significantly across the globe. While some societies prioritize long working hours and dedication to one's career, others place greater emphasis on leisure time and family life. Understanding and respecting these cultural differences is crucial in our increasingly globalized world, particularly for multinational companies and individuals working in diverse environments.

Self-care and stress management are fundamental to maintaining equilibrium. Practicing mindfulness, engaging in regular physical activity, and nurturing personal relationships are effective strategies for managing stress and preventing burnout. Additionally, learning to say ""no"" to non-essential commitments and prioritizing activities that bring joy and fulfillment can significantly contribute to overall well-being.

In conclusion, the long-term benefits of maintaining a healthy work-life balance are profound and far-reaching. Individuals who successfully navigate this balance often experience greater job satisfaction, stronger personal relationships, and improved physical and mental health. By implementing effective strategies, setting clear boundaries, and prioritizing self-care, it is possible to achieve harmony between professional ambitions and personal fulfillment, leading to a more rewarding and sustainable lifestyle.

 📖

## Here's a detailed list of examples on how to balance work with personal life:

1. Set clear boundaries between work and personal time
Why it's important: Establishing boundaries prevents work from encroaching on personal time, reducing stress and burnout.
Examples: 
- Define specific work hours and stick to them
- Create a dedicated workspace at home to separate work from living areas
- Turn off work-related notifications outside of work hours

🏠

2. Prioritize self-care activities
Why it's important: Taking care of your physical and mental health improves overall well-being and productivity.
Examples:
- Schedule regular exercise sessions
- Practice meditation or mindfulness for 10-15 minutes daily
- Ensure you get enough sleep by maintaining a consistent sleep schedule

🧘‍♀️

3. Cultivate hobbies and interests outside of work
Why it's important: Engaging in activities you enjoy helps reduce stress and provides a sense of fulfillment beyond your career.
Examples:
- Join a local sports team or club
- Take up a creative hobby like painting or writing
- Learn a new skill or language for personal growth

🎨

4. Spend quality time with family and friends
Why it's important: Nurturing relationships provides emotional support and enhances overall life satisfaction.
Examples:
- Plan regular family dinners or game nights
- Schedule weekly catch-ups with friends, either in person or virtually
- Take vacations or weekend trips with loved ones

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

5. Learn to say ""no"" to non-essential commitments
Why it's important: Avoiding overcommitment helps maintain a healthy work-life balance and reduces stress.
Examples:
- Politely decline additional work projects when your plate is full
- Limit social engagements to those that truly matter to you
- Delegate tasks at work and home when possible

🚫

6. Use technology mindfully
Why it's important: Excessive screen time can blur the lines between work and personal life, leading to constant connectivity and stress.
Examples:
- Implement app blockers or screen time limits on your devices
- Practice a ""digital sunset"" by avoiding screens an hour before bedtime
- Use separate devices or user profiles for work and personal activities

📱

7. Schedule regular ""me time""
Why it's important: Dedicating time for yourself allows for relaxation, reflection, and personal growth.
Examples:
- Take a relaxing bath once a week
- Enjoy a solo coffee or meal at your favorite café
- Spend time in nature, such as taking a walk in a park or hiking

🌳

8. Practice effective time management
Why it's important: Efficiently managing your time allows you to accomplish more at work, freeing up time for personal activities.
Examples:
- Use time-blocking techniques to schedule your day
- Prioritize tasks using methods like the Eisenhower Matrix
- Minimize distractions during focused work periods

⏰

9. Pursue professional development within work hours
Why it's important: Advancing your career during work time prevents it from encroaching on personal time while still supporting growth.
Examples:
- Attend work-sponsored training sessions or workshops
- Use lunch breaks to read industry-related articles or listen to relevant podcasts
- Participate in mentorship programs offered by your company

📚

10. Regularly reassess and adjust your work-life balance
Why it's important: Life circumstances change, so periodically reviewing and adapting your approach ensures continued balance.
Examples:
- Conduct monthly self-check-ins to evaluate your stress levels and overall satisfaction
- Have open conversations with your partner or family about their needs and your work-life balance
- Adjust your schedule or commitments as needed based on these assessments

Just a little bit of background- about 2 years ago, I (21F) had a ""friends with benefits"" situation with a guy (21M) who was also on a pre-radiology track. For about 6 months we'd regularly text, flirt, hang out, and do ""couple things"" (facetime, eat together, get coffee between classes, walk together, hold hands, kiss, sex, etc.) but when I realized that this guy wasn't actually interested in me and just enjoyed how convenient (and naïve) I was, I cut things off. We didn't see each other, much less speak for two years while I finished my prerequisites. 

Until I started at a medical college in august. We have about 70 people in our entire class- and to my absolute horror, he was one of them. I decided it would be smarter and easier to keep my distance. Until he wouldn't let me. He started to show up everywhere I was. It was innocent at first- just sitting or standing next to me, or behind me, stuff that I could easily explain away and not think anything of. Then it amped up. 
Most days, I use my lunch break to decompress. I sit by my myself outside, enjoying the peace, quiet, and fresh air after hours of sitting in a cold lecture hall with no windows. 
He took it upon himself to join me. 
He spent the entire lunch break trying to guess where he remembered me from, insisting I must've worked with him. I could've died right there. It has been a few years, and I do look a bit different. I changed my hair, went from about 120 pounds to 100 (went vegetarian and didn't eat nearly enough protein- working on fixing that), but I was literally too stunned to speak. 

Not wanting to make the situation anymore awkward for myself than it already was, I lied and agreed I must've. 
Now that he had ""figured it out"" I hoped that would be the end of it and I'd get left alone.
Nope!

The best way I can describe it- he haunts me. 
I catch him looking at me, if we're across the room he'll turn his chair or sit so he's facing me, he'll bring me up in conversations with my friends, take the occasional seat next to me, call me nicknames (which is just a shortened version of my name, so my head might be exaggerating that), touch my arms, make flirty comments and jokes (I only know because I've fallen into that honeypot before), and go out of his way to interact with me. 

I'm at a complete loss. My plan is to just keep playing along. Fake it until I make it, keep my distance as much as I possibly can and stay cordial. But this is by far the most confusing situation I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with. All I know for sure is I definitely don't trust it. 

Cutting the rambling and getting into the meat and potatoes of what I'm asking— Am I right not to trust him? Is playing nice really the best choice? Does anyone have any advice on how I should or could better handle this? 

TL;DR, a guy I used to have a ""thing"" with who strung me along for months reappeared in my life a few years after I cut him off. He claims to not remember me or where he knows me from, and now seems hellbent on interacting with me, and I need advice on how to navigate this situation.

1fte6tw,https://www.reddit.com/r/NCL/comments/1fte6tw/norwegian_epic_review/,Norwegian Epic Review,"I’ll preface my review by noting that I did not pick this cruise. I joined an already organized trip last minute, so I didn’t have a say in either the ship (Epic) or itinerary (Greece, Malta, and Italy) that was selected.

Overall, the ship itself was a huge disappointment. I’ve never sailed before with NCL, but if its other ships are like the Epic, I never will again. I have sailed on Princess, Celebrity, and Holland America, and they are all infinity superior to the Epic. They all have bright public spaces to relax and take in the scenery. Not so on the Epic. Save for the Garden Buffet and pool on Deck 15, there are no ocean views on any other deck. Instead, the entire ship is dark, with low ceilings everywhere, and generally seems designed to make passengers feel like they never left the United States. There is nothing elegant or memorable about the Epic.

The jogging track/games area on Deck 7 has no chairs or benches to sit on (unlike pretty much every other ship with a promenade-type deck), so you can’t lounge outside. Nor is there an atrium where you can chill out with a book or participate in fun events like fruit carving or musical interludes. Instead, there’s an incredibly lame, dark area of chairs facing a huge screen, where sparsely attended events hosted by unenthused staff occasionally take place. On the same floor are guest services and shore excursions, and again there is a dearth of seating. Keep moving folks!

This is true of virtually the entire ship. It’s designed to keep you moving (and probably spending) and there is no place to get comfortable. The ship is also incredibly loud. I’m not sure if it’s the clientele or the acoustics, but pretty much every public space is noisy and filled with braying passengers heehawing into their drinks. If you’re looking for tranquility, you will not find it anywhere on this ship. 

The one place NCL wants you to get comfortable is the casino. It’s huge, taking up half of Deck 6. Like pretty much every other place on the ship, it’s dark with low ceilings, and has the added “bonus” of stinking of cigarette smoke. The casino can’t be avoided as you generally must walk through it to get to deck 5, or to the Epic Theatre (bow) or the Manhattan Room (aft).

The three pools on Deck 15 (one is adult only) are ridiculously small. Both can only fit about 10 people, and one is a cold plunge pool that is very uncomfortable to hang out in. There are water features in the pool area (kind of a splash area) that don’t operate, although it seems they did at one time (based on photos from 2016 I found on the internet). That said, the pool towel service is great. You can take as many towels as you like but do need to give your room number when you pick them up and return them. 

In terms of the cabins, I stayed in a balcony cabin on Deck 12. The bathroom situation has been written about ad nauseum, so I won’t repeat the complaints. Suffice it to say that whoever designed the bathrooms must have been high when they did. The balcony cabins are incredibly small, and if one person is using the sink or the mirror, you can’t get past them. You have to climb over the bed instead, or make your roommate move. The couch area doesn’t make a lot of sense either, as you’re facing the clothes closets that are about 2-3 feet in front of you. That said, there is a huge amount of storage in each cabin. There are tons of places to store your clothes and personal items, but the downside is that some of the drawers and cupboard doors are falling apart.

The wear and tear is also showing on the balcony. Keeping with the theme of NCL not wanting you to just sit and relax, the balconies are really tired looking and not a place you want to spend a lot of time. The decking is old and worn, and the balcony railings haven’t been varnished in years. I suspect that NCL is scrimping on maintenance because they’re trying to squeeze every last dime out of the Epic before they sell it on.

The cabin beds are really close together even if you ask for twin beds (maybe 3-4 inches separate the two beds), and the beds are quite short. I’m not very tall (5’5”) and my feet hung off the bed most of the time. I can’t imagine how someone taller would manage. There is no turndown service, despite the dial outside each cabin saying there is. We were told the service was cut 2-3 years ago.

The reason for this appears to be staffing cuts. The room attendants are few and far between (certainly far fewer than on Princess and Celebrity), and our attendant never introduced himself. I ordered room service one day, and despite a card on the tray saying to call for tray pick up, no one ever came to get my tray. The room attendant had to clear it the next morning. I suspect there isn’t enough staff to actually offer the pick-up service.

Staffing is also an issue in the main dining rooms. Passengers were frequently told the Manhattan dining room was full when it wasn’t, and were made to wait ages for a table. The fact is, there isn’t enough staff to operate the dining room at full capacity. On the other hand, the specialty dining was quite nice. Le Bistro was excellent both food and service wise, as was La Cucina. Of the two, I preferred Le Bistro. It was quiet and elegant, and the portions were reasonable. The portions at La Cucina were huge, and it was considerably noisier than Le Bistro because for some strange reason, it opens up to the Garden Buffet on Deck 15.

For the most part, the food on Epic was quite good. Always fresh and plentiful, although there wasn’t much variety in the Garden Buffet. I liked being able to get my own juice, water, ice, and coffee in the buffet, and thought the wine selections available with the premium package were excellent. The beer selection, however, was limited and really sad. It was pretty much all American beer (Coors, Bud) which I don’t drink, with only one international offering (Peroni). If the aim is to make passengers feel like they’re still in the US, that’s one way to accomplish that.

The excursions were generally as advertised, but the sites themselves are incredibly crowded. Most excursions have 40-45 people, and many are not able-bodied despite the excursions often being strenuous. I don’t blame the cruise line for that. The exertion level for each excursion is noted on the website, but I suspect some people don’t bother reading the descriptions. The excursion staff are great and do their very best to get people on their way. 

All in all, the ship was not relaxing or enjoyable. I’ll spend my time and money elsewhere on future cruises.",2,1727751785.0,NCL,2,0.75,False,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x113a174a0>

As someone with literally no prior experience, I am probably over-thinking this.

I was given a girls number by a family member and told she had similar interests to me. We texted a little bit before I asked about a coffee meet-up, probably jumping the gun, but got hyped up after being extremely anxious just texting. She instead pivoted to talking online first. Understandable, I am a stranger. 

We texted a bit more, but some family issues arose and I disappeared for a month before reaching out again. I asked about doing a call, but she was sick and I honestly didn't want to be some annoyance, so told her we could wait. I then dropped off again since more family stuff arose and truthfully, I have been constantly getting cold feet, only making the gap even larger. Its been about a month again.

As mentioned above, the few who know think I should reach out again since she has never given a rejection or declined, but I feel like the ship as sailed. Since we never really engaged, its not like she would have a reason to reach out in those gaps and I honestly feel like I would be a creep to just kinda pop out of the woodworks again.

So to my understanding, that only works if you’re doing that same thing every single day, eg. Coffee with 50g milk and 5g sugar≈50cal
Logged every single day or never logged would result in a net difference of 50 cal in your calculated expenditure. 
In the most extreme circumstance you could eat the exact same thing every day at maintenance calories,not log it, and, assuming your expenditure didn’t change at all, you would have a calculated expenditure of 0cal

This seems very different from using 2tbsp of butter while cooking 2 days out of the week and not logging it because you’re being “consistent”.

1ftdsjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/1ftdsjl/recap_our_3day_itinerary_in_kcmo/,Recap: Our 3-day itinerary in KCMO,"I almost exclusively plan all our trips by searching the city's local subreddit, so I thought I would post the product of our research / what we ended up doing for our 3-day itinerary in KCMO in case it helps others! This was our first time visiting your lovely city. We are from Chicago but currently live in St. Louis, so we will be back - if we missed anything major, please let me know!

**Background**

My husband and I are 30-somethings who are mostly into eating well and going to interesting museums. Whenever possible and practical, we prefer walking or taking public transit, but due to health issues I can't walk too extensively. We prefer a flexible itinerary with one major activity and one major meal planned per day (I'll indicate these with a \* below), and the rest we slot in and improvise based on an ""options bank"" that I drum up through Reddit research. 

**Trip info**

* **Season:** We were in KC from Monday evening to Thursday afternoon during the last week of September, and other than a bit of rain the weather was lovely (high 70s). 
* **Hotel:** We stayed at the [Crowne Plaza Kansas City Downtown](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FFRyLtszKpxCHCLW7) (1301 Wyandotte Street). It was a step lower in quality than I was expecting, but the location was great and it suited our needs just fine.
* **Transportation:** We mostly walked or took public transit since a lot of our itinerary was in the downtown area, but we drove to KC and did plan one day around having a car.
* **Scheduling:** A lot of places in our options bank were closed at least one day during our trip, so the below itinerary was the best we could do to optimize. We had to hop around and double back across the map a bit, but I think it all worked out and didn't feel redundant.

**Monday**

* **Dinner:** Other than checking in, the only thing we did on our first night was walk to [Jack Stack](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sNbaJvN2Cqf3Gw1a7) (Freight House location) for barbecue. We were originally going to go to [Lazia](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9TdFJeXh5mJAmLQZ8) since we only planned on going to one barbecue place (Joe's) this trip, but we decided to come here since Reddit indicated that the carrot cake was superb. It was pretty good carrot cake, and the barbecue wasn't bad either! My husband got the lamb ribs and really enjoyed them.

**Tuesday**

* **\*Breakfast:** After multiple recommendations, we walked to [Messenger Coffee + Ibis Bakery](https://g.co/kgs/72uiQdC) to check it out. It's a very cool space and we ended up returning later to buy coffee beans and try some more pastries! 
* **\*Lunch:** We always try to eat at the best sushi restaurant in every city we visit. Reddit indicated that this is [Sushi Kodawari](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aawsvDG5Whn9CpLT7), but we weren't able to secure reservations in time. Instead, we had an early lunch at [Kata Nori](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oXitDpyBh77EFirV7) and loved it! The quality and service were great, and the concept (a hand roll and crudo bar) is awesome - I wish there were more spots like these! It was a short walk from Messenger.
* **\*Activity:** [WWI museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fL3jjWxPHBLfVhLFA). We walked here from Kata Nori, which was a longer stroll but pretty straightforward. My friend's dad is a volunteer at the museum, so he offered to give us a private guided tour. This was a cool spot and definitely worth a visit if you're into history. We also paid for Tower access, which was definitely worth the few extra bucks and offered a great view of the city. We spent around 2.5 hours here, and that was without reading all the plaques and timelines. Don't skip the basement level (we almost did when they said that nothing was labeled throughout) - my favorite part was the Mail Call display down there!    
* **Activity:** Happy hour + explore River Market. We took the free streetcar from Union Station to the River Market and walked around to get a feel for the area, then had happy hour drinks at [Harry's Country Club](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sBWs3EywP9ZkQvPh7). The Farmer's Market wasn't running during our trip, so we'll have to be back for that. We were also able to take the streetcar back to our hotel. 
* **\*Dinner:** [Joe's KC BBQ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ComMjXcmVqjM7Khw7) (aka Oklahoma Joe's or just Joe's). Per Reddit's advice, we went to the original gas station location. We drove, but there were plenty of people hopping out of Ubers while we waited in line. We arrived around 7 and the wait was about 30 minutes (the line stretched to just outside the double doors when we arrived). Definitely worth the trip - the burnt ends were to die for!

**Wednesday**

* **Breakfast:** We drove to [Chez Elle](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mfNukmW9FEbvH4Hg9) since it was a spot in our options bank that seemed to need a car, and we were already going to be driving. The crepes weren't bad, but it was a little underwhelming to be honest. I think I may have erred as I mostly chose this based on multiple TikTok recommendations, not Reddit.
* **\*Activity:** [Museum of Toys and Miniatures](https://maps.app.goo.gl/L7SnygHMyZBuG26M6). This was what I was most excited for (I've always been fascinated by miniatures), but the museum is entirely dollhouse/diorama displays and cases full of vintage toys - if that's not your thing, you should definitely pass. The museum website recommended planning 60-90 minutes - we were there about 3 hours, with the bulk of that spent on the first floor where the miniatures are. We loved it and it definitely gives you a greater appreciation of the art form!
* **Snack:** [Mclain's Bakery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5sRu5EWCkyxpgrkV7). Here's where TikTok didn't fail me - I was fading and needed a bite to eat and some caffeine, so we stopped by the Waldo location since we were already halfway there. The pastries were great (the butter roll!!!) and so was the coffee! 
* **Activity:** Explore River Market (again). We had some time to kill and I had heard that the Antiques Mall was not to be missed, so we returned to check it out and possibly also do the [Arabia Steamboat Museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ypotvVAqaMtxD1ap6). We didn't have enough time for the latter, and I'm not confident we found the former - we explored [River Market Antiques](https://maps.app.goo.gl/e6sQKBH9XJxFDFqv8), but I'm not sure if this is what Reddit meant. I'm not too into thrifting to begin with, but it was a nice way to spend an hour.
* **\*Dinner:** [Acre Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mDt2rPzXgBKrsuXp7) - Chef Counter Hearth Experience. We always do one really nice dinner on our trips, and this was it - zero regrets. The experience at the counter was great, the service and staff were amazing (they came over to show us the dry aged steaks and explained a lot of things to us between courses), and Chef Andrew chatted with us a lot as well. On top of all that, one of the best meals we've had! It's pricey, but definitely worth it if you enjoy fine dining or culinary experiences. I'd return to KCMO just to eat here!

**Thursday**

* **Breakfast:** Messenger Coffee + Ibis Bakery. We couldn't stay away! Since it was raining the first time we came, we returned to enjoy the roof deck while it was sunny, and to try the ham and cheese croissant I was eyeing previously but had skipped to save room for sushi. Unfortunately, they were sold out - but I had the kouign-amann instead and was so happy I did!
* **Activity:** [Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6d1evYdtqNqBJSaJA). We were most flexible on our last day and knew we had a long drive on the other end of the activity, so we chose the free art museum so that we could pick up and leave without any guilt over wasting our visit. I'm not much into modern art, so I greatly preferred the Nelson-Atkins half (versus the Bloch Building). You could easily spend the whole day here if you wanted to see everything, but we focused on a few rooms that interested us and strolled through the remainder. Still, we were there about 2.5 hours.
* **Lunch:** [Rye Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UUadofjSs9wRrD4z9) (Plaza location). This spot was in our options bank after I searched for which restaurants had the best dessert menus. It was a good lunch and the pie (we had blueberry streusel) was good as well. I perhaps would have enjoyed it more had we come for dinner instead and had I not had to plan for being in the car for hours afterwards. We departed for home straight from the restaurant.

I’ve met a lot of people who are convinced they can’t learn binary let alone any other number system. They see numbers and math and immediately feel overwhelmed. 

I understand that response as I myself am not particularly smart. I struggle to do simple arithmetic without my fingers or a pencil and paper. So, if I can learn this, truly anyone can.  

&nbsp;

Early in our education most of us learn about number places: the ones place, the tens place etc. Even though we learn this and pass all our tests and can count from one to infinity – most of us never actually understood what we were being taught. If we did, we would all be able to figure out binary, ternary, base four, and every other number system with relative ease. 

I think the problem is that the base ten number system is so natural to us that understanding the system behind it isn’t necessary, and in reality few ever need to understand anything beyond base ten. But, I’m going to explain how number systems work anyways because I think it's kind of fun.

&nbsp;

For those who get overwhelmed by math I’m going to start with a binary system that doesn’t use numbers.

&nbsp;

If you want to skip this method of learning binary, or go straight to the math, scroll to the line break.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Let’s start with a binary system we are all familiar with: yes and no.

&nbsp;

Pretend we work together. Every day you walk into the office I ask you the same three questions, in the same order:  

| Do you want coffee? | Do you want cream? | Do you want sugar? |
|:-------------------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|

&nbsp;

Every day you walk in anticipating these three questions in this same exact order. 

Let’s say the first time you answer:

| Do you want coffee? | Do you want cream? | Do you want sugar? |
|:-------------------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|
|        Yes          |        Yes         |        Yes         |

&nbsp;

The next day you answer:

| Do you want coffee? | Do you want cream? | Do you want sugar? |
|:-------------------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|
|        Yes          |          No        |         No         |

&nbsp;

On another day you respond:
(I still ask the questions in full)

| Coffee | Cream | Sugar |
|:------:|:-----:|:-----:|
|  Yes   |   No  |   No  |

&nbsp;

Eventually, we get to the point where I don’t even need to ask, you just come in and hold up three fingers and I know you want coffee with cream and sugar. One finger up means a black coffee. Your pointer and ring finger up with your middle finger down would mean yes to coffee, no to cream, and yes to sugar. You flipping me off would mean you just want cream – no coffee and no sugar.

&nbsp;
 
I know that a finger up means yes, and a finger down means no. You know that I only ask those same three questions, in the exact same order every time.

This system works because you and I both know what the questions, and the only suitable answers are.

&nbsp;

Let’s look at this system with zeros and ones. 

Zero means “no”, and one means “yes”.

A black coffee would be a 100:

| Coffee | Cream | Sugar |
|:------:|:-----:|:-----:|
|    1   |   0   |   0   |


A Michael Scott special (just cream and sugar) would be an 11:

| Coffee | Cream | Sugar |
|:------:|:-----:|:-----:|
|    0   |   1   |   1   |


A coffee with cream and no sugar would be a 110:

| Coffee | Cream | Sugar |
|:------:|:-----:|:-----:|
|    1   |   1   |   0   |

&nbsp;

If that all makes sense, then believe it or not you understand binary, congrats! 

The only difference between that example and computer binary, are what the values of the “questions” are. 

In binary we replace the questions with numerical values (powers of 2, which I’ll explain more below). If there is a one under the value, then it gets added up with every other value that has a one underneath it. Once you’ve added up all the values, you have your decimal number!

&nbsp;

So instead of coffee, we have 4. Instead of cream, we have 2. And instead of sugar, we have 1.

| 4 | 2 | 1 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|

&nbsp;

So for the binary number 101, you add up 4 + 1.  

| 4 | 2 | 1 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
 
4 + 0 + 1

So, the binary number 101 is equal to the base ten (decimal) number 5. It’s that easy!

Now on to other number systems. This will involve much more math, but it’s all very simple and you are allowed to use a calculator.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;


When we think of the number 300, we don’t think about the three in the hundreds place instructing us to add up 100, three times. When we think of 42, we don’t see four values of 10 and two values of 1. We don’t have to calculate it because it’s already a decimal. But in every other number system, we have to do some calculations to convert the numbers to decimal. Looking at number systems other than decimal helps to better understand this process, but first you need to know how all number systems fundamentally work.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

For every number system we need to know the digits used, and the place values.  

&nbsp;

First, the digits used:

In binary (base 2) you have two digits to make every number in that system: 0 and 1.
 
In ternary (base 3), you have three digits: 0, 1, and 2.

The digits used in every number system start with 0, so base ten isn’t 1 – 10, its 0 – 9.
 
In a number system that uses more than ten digits, we have to borrow letters from the alphabet to use as single digits beyond 9.
 
So, a base eleven number system uses digits 0 – a (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, a) where the letter “a” has a numerical value of 10.
 
Hexadecimal (base 16) uses 0 – f, with “f” having a numerical value of 15.

You might wonder why we can’t just use the numbers 10 and 15 to represent digits over 9. Why do we have to use letters? The short answer is that digits have to be single characters. The longer answer involves understanding how digits are used with place values.

&nbsp;


So, on to place values:

To find the value of each number place, we calculate the powers of however many digits are used in that number system.

You start with the zero power furthest to the right, and move up a power for each new place value in the number system.
 
Any number to the zero power is one, so every number system starts with a ones place.

For example, the ones place in decimal (base 10) is actually 10^0, the tens place is 10^1, the hundreds place is 10^2, and so on.
 
|    10^7    |    10^6    |    10^5    |    10^4    |    10^3    |    10^2    |    10^1    |    10^0    |
|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|


This is equal to:

| 10,000,000 |  1,000,000 |   100,000  |   10,000   |    1,000   |     100    |     10     |      1     |
|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|

&nbsp;

For binary:

| 2^7 | 2^6 | 2^5 | 2^4 | 2^3 | 2^2 | 2^1 | 2^0 |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

is equal to:

| 128 | 64  |  32 |  16 |  8  |  4  |  2  |  1  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|

&nbsp;

In ternary (base 3) it’s powers of 3, and in hexadecimal (base 16) it’s powers of 16. If you’re like me and you suck at doing multiplication, don’t let this deter you, just use a calculator.

&nbsp;

Once you know the place values and the digits used, you can convert to decimal with simple addition. The digit in each place value tells you how many times to add that value into the decimal total. So a 3 in the ones place for a hexadecimal number, means you add 1 + 1 + 1 – just like a 3 in the tens place for a base ten number means you add up 10 + 10 + 10.

&nbsp;

Here are some examples.  

The binary number 101 = 4 + 1:

| 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |
|:---:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|  0  |  0 |  0 |  0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |

Decimal = 5

&nbsp;

The ternary number 101 = 9 + 1:

| 2187 | 729 | 243 | 81 | 27 | 9 | 3 | 1 |
|:----:|:---:|:---:|:--:|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|   0  |  0  |  0  |  0 |  0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |

Decimal = 10

&nbsp;

The ternary number 210 = 9 + 9 + 3:

| 2187 | 729 | 243 | 81 | 27 | 9 | 3 | 1 |
|:----:|:---:|:---:|:--:|:--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|   0  |  0  |  0  |  0 |  0 | 2 | 1 | 0 |

Decimal = 21

&nbsp;

The hexadecimal number 2a3 = 256 + 256 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 + 1 + 1 + 1  

Or 2a3 = (256 * 2) + (16 * 10) + (1 * 3)  

(Remember that “a” has a numerical value of 10):  

| 256 | 16 | 1 |
|:---:|:--:|:-:|
|  2  | a  | 3 |

Decimal: 675  

This is why letters are used to represent digits over 9. The hexadecimal number 2103 converts to the decimal number 8,451, not 675. We need a single character digit that tells us there are 10 total place values of 16 in the hexadecimal number.

&nbsp;

Hopefully that wasn’t too confusing, and if you understood it than congratulations you now understand how every number system works (mostly)!  

If you want to leave now, I don’t blame you, but I would encourage you to go on so that you understand how number systems work with fractions. I promise, it’s not as scary as it sounds!  

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Fractions:  

If calculating the place values for whole numbers is just powers of the base, then calculating the place values for fractional numbers is the same – only it’s done with negative exponents (powers).  

&nbsp;

Let’s look at the base ten number 0.25.

&nbsp;

The ones place in every number system is (x^(0)), but we are looking at numbers less than 1, so on the other side of the decimal point we will start with (10^(-1)).

| 10^3 | 10^2 | 10^1 | 10^0 | . | 10^(-1) | 10^(-2) | 10^(-3) |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:-:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
|   0  |  0   |  0   |  0   | . |    2    |    5    |    0    |

&nbsp;

To get rid of the negative exponent, you turn it into a fraction (1/(10^(1))). So the first value place after the decimal point in a base ten number is the 1/10 place. The next value place is (10^(-2)), or 1/100.  

| 1000 | 100 | 10 | 1 | . | 1/10 | 1/100 | 1/1000 |
|:----:|:---:|:--:|:-:|:-:|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
|   0  |  0  |  0 | 0 | . |  2   |   5   |   0   |

&nbsp;

In our number 0.25 we have a 2 in the 1/10 place, and a 5 in the 1/100 place. So we add:

(1/10) + (1/10) + (1/100) + (1/100) + (1/100) + (1/100) + (1/100)  

&nbsp;

In case you aren’t familiar with adding fractions, to add these we need to find a common denominator. In this case it’s always going to be the biggest denominator, no matter what number system it is.

&nbsp;

So we multiply the top and bottom of the first two fractions by 10, then we can add all the fractions together. What we end up with is:  

(10/100) + (10/100) + (1/100) + (1/100) + (1/100) + (1/100) + (1/100) = 25/100  

(Just add up the top numbers like usual, and place the total over the common denominator)

&nbsp;

25/100 is 0.25…  

&nbsp;

That’s a lot of work for something that was already calculated, but the process is important to learn. So now that you know the process let’s look at a fractional binary number.  

&nbsp;

Binary number 0.11:

&nbsp;

The place values after the decimal are (2^(-1)) and (2^(-2))

| 2^3 | 2^2 | 2^1 | 2^0 | . | 2^(-1) | 2^(-2) | 2^(-3) |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:-:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
|  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  | . |    1   |    1   |    0   |

&nbsp;

or (1/2) and (1/4)

| 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 | . | 1/2 | 1/4 | 1/8 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | . |  1  |  1  |  0  |

&nbsp;

To convert our fractional binary number to decimal we add up one value of (1/2) and one value of (1/4).

(1/2) + (1/4) = (2/4) + (1/4) = (3/4) or .75

The binary number 0.11 converts to the decimal .75

&nbsp;

Let’s try ternary and hex:

&nbsp;

The ternary number 0.11 converts to the decimal number 4/9:

(1/3) + (1/9) = (3/9) + (1/9) = 4/9

| 3^3 | 3^2 | 3^1 | 3^0 | . | 3^(-1) | 3^(-2) | 3^(-3) |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:-:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
|  0  |  0  |  0  |  0  | . |    1   |    1   |    0   |

&nbsp;

| 27 | 9 | 3 | 1 | . | 1/3 | 1/9 | 1/27 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:----:|:---:|:----:|
| 0  | 0 | 0 | 0 | . |  1  |  1  |   0  |

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The hexadecimal number 0.11 converts to the decimal number 17/256:

(1/16) + (1/256) = (16/256) + (1/256) = 17/256

| 16^3 | 16^2 | 16^1 | 16^0 | . | 16^(-1) | 16^(-2) | 16^(-3) |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:-:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
|   0  |   0  |   0  |   0  | . |    1    |    1    |    0    |

&nbsp;

| 4096 | 256 | 16 | 1 | . | 1/16 | 1/256 | 1/4096 |
|:----:|:---:|:--:|:-:|:-:|:----:|:-----:|:------:|
|   0  |   0 |  0 | 0 | . |  1   |   1   |    0   |

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Let’s try with digits over 9:

&nbsp;

The hexadecimal number .a1 converts to the decimal number 161/256:

((1/16)*10) + (1/256) = (10/16) + (1/256) = (160/256) + (1/256) = (161/256)

| 16^3 | 16^2 | 16^1 | 16^0 | . | 16^(-1) | 16^(-2) | 16^(-3) |
|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:-:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
|   0  |   0  |   0  |   0  | . |    a    |    1    |    0    |

&nbsp;

| 4096 | 256 | 16 | 1 | . | 1/16 | 1/256 | 1/4096 |
|:----:|:---:|:--:|:-:|:-:|:----:|:-----:|:------:|
|   0  |   0 |  0 | 0 | . |  a   |   1   |    0   |

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;



And that’s it, or at least all I know!  

Hope you learned something, even if it's useless.

1ftdqbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1ftdqbl/carb_loading_and_prerace_breakfast/,Carb loading and pre-race breakfast,"Hi, I have a half marathon (my B race) coming up this Sunday. I'm running NYC in 4 weeks (my A race). I know I don't really need to carb load much for a half but I want to use it as an opportunity to practice my fueling strategy for the full, so want some advice going into Sunday.

I'm 32F and 49kg, per Featherstone Nutrition's carb calculator it suggests I need close to 400g of carbs the 3 days prior. I'm used to running at 5-6am with nothing but a cup of coffee (with 1/2 cup milk), and have been practicing fueling 60g/h of carbs while on the run, but nothing prior. Before long runs I usually eat a pasta dinner the night before, and I probably get no more than 200g of carbs in my normal diet. 

Is it ok to just make up the 200g by eating gels? A Precision fuel 90 is 90g, a Maurten 320 is 80g, so I'm thinking that's the easiest way to get the carbs in without feeling too full and uncomfortable. Is there any downside to doing this other than the cost? I always see eat more bagels, pasta, rice etc but don't see carb loading via gels as a commonly used strategy, even though that would take up the least space in your stomach. In her podcast Featherstone says there's no difference between complex vs simple carbs as long as you get it in.

On the morning of the race, since I don't normally eat pre-run, can I get away with again only eating gels/drinks to get the recommended carb amount? I can't really practice eating 2h before my long runs because I need to be done by 8am (live in a very hot and humid climate year round) and that would require me to wake up at 3am to run at 5am. My wave for NYC doesn't start til 10:20 so I can theoretically eat beforehand but it would be something new that I haven't practiced, so I'm leaning towards not.

He poured us drinks while I hung lights and put sheets on the bed, we laughed, not once did we bicker. He happily handled all the tall boy things I would have struggled with and would swoop me up randomly and kiss all over me. The next morning we woke up and sat in the new lounge room drinking coffee together. I put on my favorite record and he put on a muted baby animal show in the background. 

Before I met him I had some really dark nights in this house, convinced that I wouldn’t ever fall in love again. I tried to condition myself to accept that. He’s my best friend.

That means I’m forced to both work around their fee if I want to get anything in return while I’m in town to see the city not have that in my head. I wish hotels used creative ways to keep some business ‘in house’. The prices are outrageous for the most basic things; 2 yogurts with a bit of granola in plastic cup, a small regular coffee and a smoothie. $40 US and I’m Canadian!

1ftdiwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1ftdiwa/just_started_a_crash_diet/,Just started a crash diet.,"I’m a silent reader here and I’ve decided to lose weight 5 months ago.
SW = 307lbs
CW= 262lbs
Male, 25, 170 

TDEE Maintenance is roughly 2,500. Please do correct me if I am wrong.

I didn’t count calories (only adjusting the portion and cutting off sodas/sweet drinks) up until 8 days ago where I’m seeing drastic changes. I lost 6.4lbs in 7 days. What I did was counting calories, logging them religiously (no food scale but I am overestimating everything and log them into MFP app) and basically only done cardio twice. 8k steps + 5k steps. I’m not sure if it is all water weight but I just want to know if what I’m doing is sustainable in the long run. I have a calorie intake of 1500 daily between those 8 days. If I ever feel hungry, I’ll get myself a cup of black coffee (no sugar). I’m on 16:8 IF as well.

I will appreciate your suggestion about changes as well. We do have have a gym available in our building. I tried lifting weights but I feel so sore the next day that it doesn’t let me function properly at work. Running/brisk fits me bettter.

I also walk to work 5 times a week. Roughly a 40 minute walk. Home-Work-Home.

So my question is, should I up my calorie intake? How much and will it marginally slow down my progress? I aim to lose another 40lbs in 3 months.",0,1727749671.0,WeightLossAdvice,0,0.5,False,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x113a74500>

She looked at me about 8 times during the movie and idk how to say she wasn’t really watching it or paying attention it’s like she wanted me to kiss her or have sex or idk. The movie ended and she said “That wasn’t what I was expecting” and started laughing I said “Haha what do u mean” and she just said “Oh it’s nothing” so I asked “Did I do something wrong” and she said “No I love spending time with you” so we hugged so we hugged and then I left. The moment I walked out I heard her like almost cry. I texted her when I got back and I told her that I wanna take her somewhere nice in the morning and then we can go to the beach.

I literally don’t know what to do I want this girl to be my girlfriend, I want to kiss her but idk how to even kiss. Ive spent the past 2 hours talking to my buddies and they all told me I should have kissed her cause no girl just invites you over to there bedroom to watch a movie. I watched porn for the first time tonight and I’m just unsure of how to even have sex if I get there it literally looks complicated 😭 I feel like an idiot and I don’t wanna lose the girl of my dream but whenever we are together I just wanna make sure she’s happy and comfortable and I don’t wanna push any boundaries. One of my friends said just kiss her but I don’t even know how to kiss I’m here watching YouTube videos on how to do it lmfao.

1ftdfn6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ftdfn6/aitah_for_pouring_coffee_on_my_boyfriend_who_said/,AITAH for pouring coffee on my boyfriend who said I should wear makeup?,"Let me start off by saying, I'm 20M, he's 24M, I'm very feminine and do not look like a man at all (I am also transgender female to male so that's half of the case, hairless, Clear skin, etc) yet I am confident in my looks because it's my body. I like to wear make up but I still look just as attractive without it. I'm also very confident in how I act in relationships as well and don't like to tolerate stupidity because I know I'll be able to find somebody that can meet my standards and I can meet theirs. It just takes time for true love.

We met at a party. Stupid, I know. He said I was pretty and asked if we could be friends. He even defended me from his friends who kept calling me a woman and trying to make me go by ""she/her"" so he kicked them out. The party was his childhood's best friend so he also had a say in what happened there and who leaves. At first I was hesitant though to continue it because I hate when people start it off by saying ""You're pretty"" ""I really think you're attractive"" all of that shit just to end it with ''Can we be friends?"" because I've had people who used me for my looks. Not just my exes either. I lost a friend group because I found out their intentions with me.

Basically this was 4 days ago. I have no parents whatsoever because I left them because they threatened to kick out me if I like girls (they didn't know I was transitioning from a woman to a man) so I got emancipated and I have nowhere to turn to besides my boyfriend family who love me deeply and if I must say; Treats me better than their own child. 

It was around 4 in the morning when I just had woken up, I was tired because of work, I didn't feel well and my whole body was aching and I still don't know why. I decided to just stay up and went to go make me something when my boyfriend was in the kitchen drinking coffee (he stays up really late and barely gets any sleep) I asked him how he was and he just gave me a look and went back on his phone. I asked what was wrong and he said ""nothing"", He's the type of man to hide his feelings to ""not feel like a burden"" or ""make me put up with his bullshit that he can handle"", His words when we got together, Not mine.

I asked again and this is how it went

""Are you..."" bit of a pause ""okay? You seem stressed.""

""DAMNIT BITCH, Will you just shut up?""

""Am I yelling at you? No. So tone it down. I'm just trying to ask and see if there's anything I can do.""

Then he didn't say anything else and I just gave up because I thought maybe work was just as bad as mines and I started to feel bad. 20 minute later he says

""You know, You should really put on makeup when you wake up.""

I looked at him and didn't say anything. I wasn't upset or offended because as I said I'm confident in my looks and I KNOW I'm attractive with and without makeup. I finished making my food (I made waffles at 4 in the morning, For anybody who's wondering), Then I turned around to face him and asked if I could have some of his coffee because I was too tired to make my own. This man says ""Of course, Darling"" after just telling me to put on makeup. I put it to my lips then I put the mug above his head when he was on his phone and just poured that shit and went upstairs to go eat. I heard him screaming and throwing shit and calling me by my deadname (No. I did not tell him it either. He found a card or something with it on it when I went to go get something from my parents house and he came along with me)

I just ate my food and turned on ""The Walking Dead"" because there is no good reason a man in a relationship should be saying if you need to go put on makeup or not. That goes for men saying that to women as well. It just pisses me off. 

A day later his parents call me and ask me what I did that. I explained my side of the story and they said they'll talk to my boyfriend about what he said but we both needed to apologize at some point once we're calm. His girl bsf calls me and blows up and says I shouldn't have done that because I ""hurt him physically"" and calls me so many names. Baby it's just coffee.

It's got to be really good bread and some deli meat, preferably turkey because I don't like cold beef unless it's raw. Then I want vegetables, lots of vegetables and sprouts! More sprouts the better! 

There are times when the only thing I eat is cottage cheese or homemade custard. I'll drink coffee or I'll make a moka (it's a kind of a espresso type coffee that's made in a specific moka pot) and then I'll have catfish 5 days in a row so then I'll buy enough for the next week and now I've got a freezer full of stuff.

The next time I came into work after the situation with Dr. Harrison and Kara, I thought about whether I should accept the pay raise and continue working at the office. I unlocked the front door and entered the waiting room, still working things out in my mind when I slammed right into a person. I sputtered backward and looked up in confusion and horror since I was supposed to be the only one allowed in this early at the clinic. 



“You must be, Maggie!” a cheery voice told me as he moved past me and turned off the alarm before it began blaring. I clutched my heart at the shock this stranger had just given me. The fact that he knew me but I didn’t know who he was made it worse. 



“W-who are you?” I blurted out after my heart nearly split my sternum and lept out of my chest. He flicked on the lights and the waiting room was fully lit up, revealing the person who had startled me so badly. To my surprise he seemed normal. I know that’s weird to say, but he seemed just so average. Average height, build everything. His hair was combed nicely and he had a big smile on his face. 



“I’m Wilson! Your new security guard.” He waved at me happily. I let my jaw drop a little at that. Not to throw shade at Wilson, because he’s such an absolute sweetheart, but he does not strike me as any kind of security guard. The only thing he had on that showed him to be a security guard was the vest that said security on it that he wears. I was also shocked that he had been hired so quickly! It had taken less than two days for Dr. Harrison to hire him. 



“H-how long have you been here?” I asked him, as I started to calm down and walked over to my reception desk. I was always the first one here and I usually arrived pretty early in the morning, so to be beaten here was an absolute shock to me. 



“Oh, I just arrived a couple of minutes ago actually! Sorry for locking the door, I had orders from Dr. Harrison to lock it after I entered,” he told me as he followed me over to my desk. That made sense to me. If he was going to be our security it made sense for him to arrive first now. As I started getting my things ready, I watched as Wilson took his post by the front door. He stood so still I swore he would make a perfect King’s guard. 



I slowly got to work on some paperwork as I waited for the hours to tick down to when Dr. Harrison and Rachael would arrive. Rachael was the first of the duo to arrive, rushing past the line of people who were already queuing for their appointments. She mumbled to herself as she dusted herself off and looked over at Wilson without even getting a slight startle from him. 



“Hey fatty,” she called out to me as she walked up to my desk. I didn’t even bat an eye at her as I flipped through the final few sheets of paperwork that I had. When she noticed that I wasn’t paying any attention to her, she walked up to me and slapped her hands down on the desk to get my attention. 



“Oh Rachel, I didn’t hear you come in,” I told her with a smile. The pissed-off look on her face was the most rewarding sensation I can get. “How can I help you, sweetie?” I asked her with a smile, sliding a bowl of candy close to her to tempt her. She looked at it with disgust and at me with even more. 



“Keep an eye on Wilson. If he starts doing anything weird, hand him off to Dr. Harrison. Understand? Get that through your thick twinky filled skull?” She tapped my forehead for emphasis. I swatted her hand away and nodded at her. I chanced a peep over at Wilson and noticed that he was looking at the two of us. I smiled and waved at him and he did the same. 



“I’ll be sure to keep you informed, Rachael. Oh by the way, when did you want me to schedule that operation for you?” I asked her, pulling some papers from underneath my desk. She looked at me with confusion.



“What operation?” She asked, to which I smiled devilishly. 



“The one to get that stick out of your ass,” I said with a little giggle. She tsked in anger and stormed off to get ready for the day's surgery. Leaving me to giggle and continue with my paperwork. About half an hour later, Dr. Harrison arrived also being hounded by the waiting patients. He sighed and looked over at Wilson with a smile and tussled his hair like an approving father.



“Hello, Dr. Harrison.” I waved at him as he approached. He flashed me a perfect toothy grin and came up to the desk. “You’ve got another busy day ahead of you, huh?” I asked him as I handed him a stack of papers and clipboards. He took one look at them and sighed as he took his glasses off and rubbed his eyes. 



“It’s never-ending,” he said with a sigh as he accepted the giant stack of forms and clipboards from me. He glanced over towards Wilson and then back at me. “Rachael told you to keep an eye on him, correct?” he asked me as he struggled with his mountain of paperwork. 



“Mhm,” I told him, just adding to the pile like a giant Jenga tower. “I’ll be sure to inform you, sir,” I told him as I finally finished giving him everything. He sighed and looked back over at Wilson. 



“Wilson, help me carry this shit.” He ordered the security guard. He nodded quickly and walked over, taking half the stack of papers from him and helping him carry them to the back operating rooms and consultation rooms. After Wilson returned I nodded at him and he opened the floodgates to allow everyone in. I braced myself for a long day as I started listening to what the patients wanted and what they needed. 



“What do you mean in six months?! I need this surgery now! Can’t you fucking see that you fucking cow?!” A woman screamed at me, tapping her manicured fingers on her clipboard for emphasis. I watched her and waited for her to finish so I could explain it to her. 



“Ma’am, Dr. Harrison is completely booked for the next six months. Now if someone cancels, there may be an opening, but for the foreseeable future I can only get you an appointment in six months.” I told her again, but she just completely refused to listen to me. 



“Get rid of someone’s appointment then! How is it that these ugly fuckers can get ahead of me?!” She screamed at me, getting some spit on my face. 



“Because they made an appointment before you, ma’am,” I told her, struggling to keep my composure. “Once again, I can schedule you for a visit in six months. Or you can wait and have it take even longer.” I pulled out the application for her and when I looked back at her, she was lunging at me to strangle me. She grabbed me by the throat and was about to start squeezing when she was suddenly yanked away from me. 



I coughed in surprise and looked over to see that Wilson had grabbed the lady and was effortlessly dragging her away and toward the entrance. She was screaming and kicking and throwing every kind of obscenity my way. Wilson leaned down and grabbed her by the hair and by her clothes and tossed her out like they do in cartoons. I was stunned at how strong he was, and what he had done to that woman, seemed to calm the other patients down as they came back up to me to continue with their paperwork and questions. 



At around noon I leaned back and gave myself a good stretch that popped a few joints and fixed my back. It was almost my lunch time and I looked over to see how much longer it would be. As I did I heard something skitter away and the lost and found box tipped over. I rolled my chair over towards it in complete confusion and saw that a few more items were missing. 



“What the hell?” I wondered aloud, before picking and placing things back into the box. I rolled back over to my desk and decided to keep more of an eye on the box. When I turned back out to look at the lobby I was shocked to see Wilson staring silently at me. 



“Is something wrong?” he asked me after I had jumped a foot out of my chair in surprise at seeing him standing there. 



“No, no, everything is okay, thank you Wilson. And thank you for dealing with that woman.” He smiled at me and nodded before going back over to his post. At this point, most of the patients had been dealt with and I was doing some more paperwork. Mostly just filling in a few items and signing off on some things. 



“Hey, Maggie, it’s your lunchtime,” Dr. Harrison said as he stuck his head into my reception area.” I looked over at him and smiled in excitement. Standing up from my chair and stretching some more again. 



“Can I get you anything while I’m gone, sir?” I asked him. He looked over at the old antique phone mounted on the wall. Still waiting for it to ring but with no luck. He sighed and pulled down his surgical mask before shaking his head. 



“Just the usual coffee is fine. How is Wilson? Anything strange?” he asked me as he entered the reception area completely and pulled off his surgical gloves. I looked back over at our silent guardian. 



“Well, there was a woman who tried to choke me out, he grabbed her and tossed her out,” I told him, mimicking how Wilson had thrown the woman out of the waiting room. Dr. Harrison looked over at Wilson for a moment and then nodded. 



“Alright. Well, I’ll have him watch your desk while you’re out.” I nodded as I grabbed my purse and phone. “Oh, one more thing. Has Rachael been making fun of you?” he asked me, which got my attention and stopped me from finishing my packing up. Rachael had always made fun of me for my weight, but like I’ve said before I’ve always been comfortable with who I am, so I’ve never allowed her words to get to me. 



“Sometimes, but it’s nothing I can’t handle sir,” I said with a smile. He looked at me and slowly nodded his head. Those gorgeous green eyes glimmered in the light of my office. Anytime I look too long at them I feel almost lightheaded. So I pulled my eyes away and finished packing up. “I’ll be going now sir, I’ll be back with your coffee.” 



“Right, see you soon, Maggie,” he said, slipping back into the hallways behind my office. I walked out into the waiting room and walked up to Wilson. 



“I’m off to lunch!” I told him and he nodded with a smile as well. I exited the clinic and headed to a nearby sandwich shop to get a bite to eat. After I’d eaten my sandwich, I stopped at the coffee shop that me and Dr. Harrison both enjoy before making my way back to the clinic. I was walking through the parking lot when I saw a hoard of people running and screaming out of the clinic. 



At first, I was worried that a fire had broken out or something, so I quickly ran closer to get a sense of what was happening. The people were all screaming in absolute terror and this didn’t seem to be a scream of the fire, these were screams of complete terror. Against my better judgment, I rushed in past the scores of screaming people, doing my best to keep my two coffees above everyone’s heads. 



When I finally made it into the lobby I could see why everyone had been running and screaming for their lives. Limbs and chunks of flesh were thrown in every direction. Some people were crawling away with only a few limbs still attached and screaming their lungs out. 



I looked over towards my desk and saw that Wilson was standing behind it. But he looked much different. His body was melting, not just his face but he looked like a wax sculpture melting in the summer heat. He looked over at me and I watched in disgust as one of his eyes slowly began to melt out of its socket. 



“Oh fuck that,” I declared and quickly turned around to leave, that was before something grabbed me by the leg and stopped my from running, yanking me backward into the waiting room again. I looked down at the floor and saw one of the arms on the floor was still moving somehow. I stared at it in horror but before I could process it, the severed arm began pointing towards my office again. 



I looked over and saw that the Wilson blob was no longer looking at me. He seemed to be transfixed on something. I looked down at the arm again and groaned a little as I started stepping through the bloody mess that the waiting room had become. As carefully as I could I started walking towards the doors that separate the waiting room from the ORs and the consultation rooms. 



I carefully opened the door and entered the hallways and was surprised to see both Dr. Harrison and Rachel standing nearby, Dr. Harrison’s gaze trained fully on the Wilson blob, and Rachael motioning for me to enter the closest consultation room with her. I quickly ran over and once I was in, Dr. Harrison followed after me and slammed the door behind him. 



“Way to go fatass, you were supposed to warn Dr. Harrison if that idiot started acting weird!” Rachael hissed at me, I could tell she wanted to smack the shit out of me, but with Dr. Harrison here she couldn’t. 



“He was fine when I left! What the hell is going on here?!” I demanded to know, suddenly realizing that I still had the coffees that Dr. Harrions and I were going to drink. 



“Quit both of you!” Dr. Harrison screamed. Rubbing his eyes and walking past the two of us and looking at himself in the mirror. He sighed and pulled out a bottle of eyedrops and began to squeeze a few drops into his eyes. “This is my fault. I got too focused on the surgery that I let my hold on Wilson slip.” He sighed, rubbing his eyes and blinking rapidly once the drops had settled. 



“What do we do now, sir?” I asked him, still confused but in a life and death situation, you don’t have any time to contemplate shit. I carefully handed him his hot coffee and he looked at it and then up at me. Sighing before taking it from me and opening the lid to blow on it. 



“Well…we have liquid nitrogen in one of the ORs. One of the operations today was a mole removal so we have it prepped. Maybe we can freeze him partially.” He wondered aloud to himself, starting to sip at his coffee and wincing at how hot it was. 



“With all due respect, sir. I don’t think he’s quite melted enough to ensure a thorough freeze. Couldn’t we simply turn the heater on and melt him? Then freeze him afterward?” Rachael asked, which seemed like a good idea to me. 



“Rachael…I don’t think I need to tell you, why that’s a horrible fucking idea.” Dr. Harrison hissed as he stared at Rachael with absolute disdain in his eyes and face. Rachael seemed to realize her mistake and quickly shirked away from Dr. Harrison’s intense gaze. I didn’t understand why it was a horrible idea but I didn’t want to pry. 



The three of us stood there trying to think of a way to escape. I took a sip of my iced coffee before looking over at Dr. Harrison’s coffee, which was still scolding hot. I carefully set mine down and walked up to him and took it from him. 



“What? Suddenly liking hot coffee?” he asked, a bit confused. I smiled and shook my head at him. 



“Why not just throw this at Wilson?” I pointed at the coffee. Dr. Harrison looked at me and then slowly began to nod. He turned to Rachael and ordered her to follow me out into the hall while he went to get the tank of liquid nitrogen. 



We opened the door to the hallway and Rachael and I went out to look for Wilson. It was pretty easy to find him since he had left a gross wet trail right to him. He was in the lobby eating several body parts and was seemingly paying us no attention. 



“Okay, you distract him, I’ll throw it on him,” I told Rachael. She looked at me like I was crazy. 



“Just throw it at him, he’s already distracted, you idiot.” She hissed, which got me to pout at her. 



“You’re no fun.” I huffed, before starting to sneak over towards the Wilson blob. As he was eating I stepped up behind him and quickly tossed the scolding cup of coffee on him. His skin boiled and sizzled and he screamed out in pain. A decent portion of it had landed on his face and the already melting skin began to slosh off of him in great wet chunks. 



“Out of the way, Maggie!” Dr. Harrison shouted walking past me with a bucket in his hands. I quickly ran behind him and with a quick flick, he threw the whole bucket at Wilson. His body began to steam and hiss as the two clashing temperatures on him collided. The liquid nitrogen began to take effect and Wilson began to freeze in place, and in a few moments, he was frozen solid. 



“Thank God that’s over.” Rachael sighed, walking over to us. Dr. Harrison however didn’t look too happy about this. He looked terrified. I looked around the waiting room and stared at the gore that had happened, and before I could even think about what I was doing I leaned over and threw up on Rachael’s shoes. 



She said every swear in the book as she stepped away from me. I apologized half-heartedly and noticed that Dr. Harrison was gone. I looked around for him and noticed his trail in the Wilson goop and gore led back to the reception desk. I poked my head in and noticed that he was using that old phone. And that he looked like a wound-up ball of anxiety. He was tapping his foot and biting his nails as he was waiting for the phone to connect. 



“Hello, sir. Yes. Yes, I know. Yes, I’m aware Mr. Sinclair.” Dr. Harrison nodded over and over again. I had never seen him so submissive before. It was like he was being scolded by his father. “Well…something happened and I need your help to clean it up. Yes, quite a few actually. I’m sorry sir…I thought I could handle it.” He winced afterward. 



“You barf on my shoes and now you’re eavesdropping on our boss?” Rachael asked me, startling me and getting a yelp out of me. Dr. Harrison looked over at us and turned his back to us, starting to talk quieter so we couldn’t hear him. 



“You can go home, we’re gonna be closed for a while.” Rachael told me, before walking away down the hall towards the ORs. I watched her and sighed as I picked up the few items I had at my desk that weren’t covered in Wilson goop. 



“I appreciate that, sir. Thank you. I’ll make it up to you.” Dr. Harrison sighed and hung up the antique phone. Walking back into the hallway without telling me goodbye. The first time that’s ever happened. 



I wasn’t called back into work until the end of the week and when I entered the lobby I was shocked to see Wilson standing at his post with that same happy smile as before he turned into a melted version of himself. Not only that, but the waiting room was completely spotless and looked cleaner than it had ever been. 



“Morning Maggie! I’m so sorry about what happened last time, I promise it won’t happen again.” He told me, to which I could only nod and walk past him towards my desk. I gripped my can of pepper spray close until Dr. Harrison came into work. I quickly stood up and ran over toward him. 



“What’s he doing back?!” I asked, completely stunned that he had allowed Wilson back in any form or shape. 



“I had him fixed. He should work much better now.” Dr. Harrison sighed and I could tell he was still upset over what had happened. He looked at me with those beautiful green eyes and I saw for the first time since meeting him, pain and sadness behind them. “I'm so sorry this happened, Maggie. I wanted to make you feel safer and I fucked it up.” He sighed and rubbed his messy brown hair. 



“I-It’s alright sir! I still have…a lot of questions. But I’m just glad that you’re okay. And…if you say that Wilson is better now, I can accept him.” I looked over at Wilson and gave him an awkward smile and wave. He waved back. 



“I appreciate that, Maggie,” he said with a small smile. He patted me on the head and walked past me to start his day. I walked back over to my desk and finished preparing for my shift. 



I’ve been keeping a close eye on Wilson, and for the most part, he hasn’t shown any signs of melting into a horrible monster. Sometimes I notice that his face looks a little lopsided, but after I tell Dr. Harrison it's usually a quick fix. What surprised me most about the incident was that nobody reported it. Nobody so much as talked about it besides the three of us. 



I’m in a dilemma of being paid very well and now being safely guarded at my work. And yet there’s still this nagging feeling in the back of my mind, that something horrible is just lurking below the surface. 



And that also something keeps stealing from the lost and found.

The digital nomad lifestyle has become a popular trend, attracting individuals who value freedom, flexibility, and adventure. But beyond the practical aspects, there is a visual style emerging—that is the digital nomad aesthetic. This aesthetic captures the spirit of a life on the go, blending creativity with functionality. It reflects both the environments and experiences of those who embrace this lifestyle. As you delve deeper into the digital nomad aesthetic, you’ll discover how it shapes not only how individuals present themselves but also how they navigate the world.

At its core, the digital nomad aesthetic embodies a sense of wanderlust. It’s characterized by a few key elements that resonate with the modern traveler. Here’s a breakdown of these elements:

Natural Elements: Expect to see a lot of earth tones, organic textures, and greenery. Think of cozy beach huts, rustic cafes, and open-air workspaces. This connection to nature creates a laid-back vibe that reflects the serene moments found while traveling.
Minimalist Designs: The aesthetic leans toward simplicity. Clutter-free spaces and functional designs help nomads work effectively without distraction. Think of a laptop on a simple desk by the seaside—pure and productive.
Comfortable, Stylish Clothing: Digital nomads often prioritize comfort without compromising on style. Flowy dresses, light fabrics, and versatile pieces dominate their wardrobes, making it easy to transition from work to play.
Local Art and Handcrafted Items: Many nomads incorporate local cultural elements into their spaces, often curating artifacts that remind them of their travels. This gives a sense of personalization and appreciation for the places they visit.
Tech-Friendly Accessories: The right tools keep digital nomads connected wherever they go. Stylish tech bags, portable chargers, and ergonomic gadgets often become part of the aesthetic.
The digital nomad aesthetic isn’t just about what you see; it’s also about how the lifestyle makes you feel. It fosters a mindset of possibility and exploration. By creating a working environment that inspires creativity, individuals can embrace new ideas and perspectives. For example, working on a sun-drenched terrace or in a bustling co-working space brings energy that traditional offices might lack.

The aesthetic is also heavily influenced by the need to balance work and leisure. You’ll often see images of people working from unique locations—beachfront cafés, mountain retreats, or vibrant city streets. This balance reflects the nomadic commitment to living life fully. To capture this in your own visual storytelling, consider the following tips:

Show Your Workspace: Share photos of your set-up in various locations. Highlighting a unique work environment can help others envision their journeys.
Document Your Journey: Capture candid moments during your travels. These images tell a story about your experiences that resonate with fellow wanderers.
Highlight Connections: Showcase the people you meet along the way. Building a community is a vital piece of the digital nomad experience.
Use Natural Light: Whether you're taking photos or creating content, natural lighting enhances the overall feel. It captures the beauty and warmth of your surroundings.
Be Authentic: Share real moments. Whether it’s a beautiful sunset or a chaotic travel day, authenticity strengthens your connection with your audience.
Furthermore, many digital nomads utilize platforms like Instagram and Pinterest to showcase their aesthetic. The right hashtags, such as #DigitalNomad or #NomadLife, can help build a following and connect with others who share similar dreams. The digital nomad aesthetic encourages individuals to curate their experiences creatively and authentically.

The digital nomad aesthetic is more than a visual style; it embodies a lifestyle characterized by exploration, creativity, and connection. Whether you’re wandering through bustling city streets or relaxing in nature, this aesthetic invites you to capture and share your journey. By embracing the various elements—from minimalist designs to natural settings—you can develop an engaging visual narrative that reflects your adventures as a digital nomad. Ultimately, it’s a celebration of freedom, allowing you to express yourself while living in the moment.

The Impact of Social Media on the Digital Nomad Community
The rise of the digital nomad lifestyle has transformed how many individuals conceptualize work and travel. With the freedom to live and work anywhere, digital nomads have embraced flexibility, creativity, and community. One of the key enablers of this lifestyle is social media, which has created a significant impact on how digital nomads connect, share experiences, and build networks across the globe.

Social media platforms serve as essential tools for digital nomads. They facilitate real-time communication, offer access to resources, and provide opportunities for collaboration in a manner that was previously unimaginable. Many nomads utilize platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter to showcase their travels, share tips, and connect with like-minded individuals.

One of the most powerful aspects of social media is its ability to create community. Digital nomads often find solace in online groups dedicated to their lifestyle. These groups allow members to share advice, offer support, and even organize meet-ups. By fostering connections with others who understand the challenges and joys of a nomadic life, individuals can combat feelings of loneliness that might arise from their travels.

Facebook Groups: Many digital nomads join specialized groups focused on specific regions or interests. These platforms often have thousands of members who share personal experiences, local tips, job opportunities, and travel advice.
Instagram: This visual platform allows users to showcase their journeys through captivating photography. By using specific hashtags like #digitalnomad or #remotework, travelers can gain visibility and connect with others on similar paths.
LinkedIn: As a professional networking site, LinkedIn allows digital nomads to build their personal brands and find clients or job opportunities globally. Members can display their work portfolio and connect with potential employers while on the go.
Social media is also instrumental in providing resources and learning opportunities for aspiring digital nomads. Blogs, podcasts, and video channels created by seasoned nomads often cover essential topics from finding suitable coworking spaces to managing remote teams effectively. For instance, YouTube channels dedicated to this lifestyle often feature tutorials, travel hacks, and insights on balancing work and adventure. This wealth of information contributes to a smoother transition into the nomadic lifestyle for newcomers.

Moreover, social media influences the travel preferences of digital nomads. Platforms like Instagram shape the understanding of popular destinations and hidden gems through visual storytelling. Travelers may choose specific locations based on current trends and recommendations shared by their peers. This creates a dynamic ecosystem where experiences are heavily influenced by social media representation, which can sometimes skew perceptions of what it means to truly experience a place.

The digital nomad community on social media thrives on authenticity and inspiration. Many individuals share candid moments that highlight both the highs and lows of their journey. By doing so, they create a realistic portrayal of the digital nomad lifestyle, steering away from the often glamorized versions perpetuated by mainstream media. This authenticity encourages engagement and relatability, forming deeper connections among the community.

However, with social media's impact comes a few challenges. As the digital nomad trend continues to grow, so does competition. The pressure to maintain an enticing online presence may lead some individuals to curate a version of their life that isn’t entirely genuine. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy or burnout, as they compare their reality to others’ highlight reels.

Additionally, the relentless nature of social media can disrupt work-life balance. Notifications, messages, and the urge to stay connected can detract from the focus needed for productive work. Digital nomads must develop boundaries regarding their social media usage to ensure they remain present during both work and leisure.

The impact of social media on the digital nomad community is profound and multifaceted. It provides invaluable resources, fosters connections, and encourages the sharing of experiences. As this lifestyle continues to evolve, digital nomads should strive to use social media as a tool for empowerment, support, and genuine connection, allowing them to thrive in their journeys while making the most of the modern, interconnected world.

Conclusion
The digital nomad aesthetic is more than just a visual style; it encapsulates a lifestyle filled with adventure, creativity, and freedom. Embracing this aesthetic means curating not only your workspace but also your experiences and connections with others around the globe. From your essential gear, like your laptop and portable WiFi, to the travel-friendly accessories that keep you organized, every choice contributes to your unique journey.

Creating a work-friendly space anywhere encourages you to adapt and make the most of your surroundings. Whether you're setting up a cozy corner in a café or transforming a beach bungalow into an office, flexibility is key. Balancing work and travel is crucial for long-term success. With tips like setting a routine and knowing when to unplug, you can ensure that your adventures don't overshadow your professional responsibilities.

Social media plays a vital role in connecting digital nomads, allowing you to share experiences and gain inspiration from others on similar paths. It fosters a sense of community that transcends borders, helping you find fellow travelers, share tips, and even collaborate on projects.

The digital nomad aesthetic invites you to live authentically and purposefully, reminding you that work can be seamlessly integrated into a life filled with exploration and discovery. As you navigate this dynamic lifestyle, remember that the journey is just as important as the destination. Embrace the remote work revolution, celebrate your unique experiences, and let the world be your office.",1,1727749007.0,digitalnomadlife,0,1.0,False,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x1139f2840>

1ftd57p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1ftd57p/im_sick_of_this_i_just_needed_to_say_it_publicly/,I'm sick of this. I just needed to say it publicly. ,"We've been together over 21 yrs. I am 50, she's 55. We have 3 teens at home and 2 adult children who don't live with us anymore. We went through a lot of hard times together- rebuilding our lives far from home among strangers after Hurricane Katrina, raising a severely autistic child together, a devastating house fire, problems with her family and mine.   
  
But over the last three years, our lives have been much more stable and secure. So I'm trying to get back in the groove of being romantic and spending time together. But it's been 3 years of begging, pleading, dragging, and prodding. Going out for dinner or coffee and dessert, going to the mall, the neighborhood pool, the gym? She won't do anything with me. She just wants to watch TV or play games on her cell phone.

When we first got married, she wanted to be a stay-home mom. So I work and commute over 12 hours a day to make that possible. But she's the one who's always tired, sick, or exhausted. I've gotten her to start taking meds for her blood sugar, cholesterol, and low metabolism. I've gotten her to start taking vitamins and minerals. But I can't get her to eat right, exercise, or quit smoking. 

We all know men and women age differently. I feel like I'm in my 20s regarding my energy level, sex drive, and interest in life. I suffer from depression and anxiety, but I counter it by starting each day with exercise, cold shower, and affirmations. I raise my energy level and go do my 12 hours. Then I come home looking to have fun and enjoy life. But I am all by myself in that regard.

But when I accuse her of not loving me, she seems genuinely shocked and hurt. And I really do believe that she loves me. Just not in a way that I need her to.

I'm not going to divorce her- we love each other, get along decently, and have kids together. There's no violence or substance abuse or anything crazy. It's just that I'm sick and tired of not having a partner who shares my commitment to living.

Went and got some coffee and went to the river like we were doing.

He was just so confusing that I don't think I'll ever know what to make of him. And I don't have any more chances to find out any more that might make it make sense. Because he's gone. It's over. We were finally fixing all the problems and we were finally doing good.

And my granny is still alive and she's just so judgemental. And I know he wouldn't be happy with me for feeling like it's not right that she's here and he's not, but I just can't help it. I don't hate her, I don't want her dead, it just doesn't feel right that he's gone and she's here.

It's just so weird and I'm sad but it doesn't feel like normal sad. Nothing about this makes sense to me and I have no idea how to process it still at all.",2,1727748359.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False,<praw.models.reddit.submission.SubmissionFlair object at 0x1139f3170>

Druwayu which literally means True Ways. We can isolate things down to the following basics:

1) Every Monday Evening is a Religious Observance.

2) Pizza, Heavy Metal and Strip Teases are Sacred Observances.

3) We have actual valuable teachings worthy of consideration.

4) We admit we believe in God, plus Three More (Because he is a polygynist).

5) Wearing a mix of biker, warlock and witch garb is formal wear.

6) We embrace Logic, Humor and Absurdity.

How you choose to express Druwayu is up to you. Come check it out and see if it works for you. Your support is always appreciated!

1ftd119,https://www.reddit.com/r/skoolies/comments/1ftd119/ecojohn_tinyjohn_review/,Ecojohn TinyJohn review,"My shortie was built out to be a weekender/tailgating RV. Goal was to get a solid, low maintenance 72hrs out of her. To that end, no water tanks (just water jugs with a rechargeable pump) and a fill and dump water basin for dishes, no shower, and I didn’t want to fool with black water. 

So I went with the Ecojohn TinyJohn propane incinerator toilet. 

Pros:  easy to install. It really does burn it all into ash. Not as weird pooping into the coffee filter insert as I expected. 

Cons: needs some fine tuning, I had to email tech support the first time because it wouldn’t ignore and I had to adjust the air intake. It was an easy fix but a pain to have to do it the literal first time and there was nothing in the materials to tell me to expect it. The poop burn cycle doesn’t stink, surprisingly. It does smell like SOMETHING is burning, and it’s not especially pleasant, but not nearly as bad as I expected.  The urine smell can get overpowering at times though, so I’d recommend peeing in the woods if you’re boondocking. 

Overall, I’ve been pleased with it. Haven’t had nearly the trouble others report. Even though I’m happy to use a portajohn at the tailgate lot to pee, it’s nice to have a little more private and clean option for the deuce.  If I had a solar system I’d consider going all electric to not have to worry about propane running out, but it lasts a long time if you’re judicious with it.
